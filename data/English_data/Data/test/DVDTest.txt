this was a defective unit got new unit and it works as expected
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord if you do n't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all
pluged it in and good to go , i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen , a little overwhelmed with all the features , it could be more stremlined , for a novice user they would be entirely lost , perhaps that is whats on the install disk \( easier setup \) , but my experience self , got through just fine , enabled the maximum security features \( more so then the easy setup button , which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments \)
i'm glad that i bought the carry case with my garmin etrex , because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry i have n't used the belt clip yet , but i liked that option
after reading the online reviews of this product vs the portable product i went with this one portability is not much of a need , i plan on being around a power outlet the sound is in line with a radio boom box of the same size and it 's about the same weight i have a lot of trees around my house so i have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit i have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and i can hear it all over the first floor of my home so far i'm happy that i bought it
i was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system i purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased you can hear the music in several other rooms if the volume is turned up , without distortion
this case is a veritable dirt magnet it attracts more lint than i ever knew existed on my desk however , it protects very well one thing i was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen however , it does n't even touch the ipod also i worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel while it is n't quite as sensitive , it makes it more precise in my opinion , seeing as how i all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when i wanted in the s range without the case on this blue case even looks good on my black ipod , even though i was worried the color would appear muted it 's still vibrant
printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is , cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i'm fine with that
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago one handset gave us problems from the start , but was promptly replaced when returned for service the system works fine in our 2 story , 2 , 300 sq ft home i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street i like the features , including paging system , call transfer , and handset speakerphone being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus i think the sound quality is very good , and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag
i bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it ! it has great sound quality i love the features it has such as speakerphone , caller id , and it 's phone directory the only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice into both directories oher than that , this is a great phone i have owned panasonic and ge cordless phones in the past and had problems i even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late
this fm transmitter is the bomb diggiti ! !
on the plus side , it 's a great value for the games that do work on the t5 simcity alone is probably worth the price
hp premium plus photo paper is the only way to go if you desire tremendous photos from your home printer without any scratching , scuffing or blemishes i have tried less expensive paper from hp as well as other manufacturers the difference in quality is obvious if you want friends and family to think you know what you are doing , share photo 's on hp premium plus glossy paper
excelent , hard drive , good price and good time for seller
i ordered one from an amazon partner for 01 plus shipping , then with my a9 discount the price was even lower so i got one for less than the shipping cost true , the seller made a little on the shipping maybe 4 50 not counting time think how much apple must be making ! the packaging did n't mention nano so with a bit of trepidation i plugged it into the wall and my ipod and my nano liked it ! charging happened it must have been made before the nano came out as other reviewers have said , buy this one and avoid a high price elsewhere
i purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go the case holds the gps , mount and all the different cables the foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or without the velcro staps hold the mount the ac cord this way when you are looking for it , everthing is in one place the case is made well and very plain looking on the outside , so not to draw any attention
very easy to set up , great product picture is great on my samsung 50 inch plasma
it is a pleasure to use this dvd player the quality of the image is superb it upgrades definition on dvds and the difference is very \( favorably \) noticed as compared to that obtaibed from a less than a year old sony player \( with hdmi \) , the difference in image quality absolutely huge
i had a problem with my sunrocket voip and i read that someone had bought this modem and that it solved her problem i gave it a shot and guess what no more dropped calls thank you motorola ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally , the dvi d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a dvi d cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few \( very few \) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of hdmi , nobody really makes them anymore
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand
i am not really a big tech person so i do n't have the mega system hooked up to my computer and dvd tv but i do know that since i got this i have been blasting my music like crazy i do n't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because i have enough space down there and all i have to is lean down anyway i personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud \( considering its computer speakers \) i do n't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when i'm in the shower so i am pretty much happy with them
these speakers are amazing , i am truly shocked to receive something so sweet at an unbelievable price , amazon thank you for the hook up , my speaker system rocks my delivery experience with amazon was great ca n't thank you enough , keep up the great service , truly
i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers , but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks , creatures , or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop , i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max \( yes i underestimated these speakers \) when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume , and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk !
the camera is perfect if using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you the picture is clear not to grainy the only heads up is lighting try to use the camera in a well light area we are stationed in japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home the camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick the best part is the price wo n't break the bank
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon 's free shipping option , but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma mp780 \( that i also bought from amazon \) most of my printing is borderless 8 1 2x11 and the quality is always great definitely worth it if turnaround time is a problem , buy two so you always have a spare
gave as a gift excellent value tune capacity more than sufficient , easy to use and sound quality is right up there must get one for myself
outstanding product as you would expect from panasonic incoming calls loud and clear the scroll telephone directory is convenient and easy to use i do not like the beep sound when the hand set is placed back in the cradle \( it cannot be turned off
i often have problems with memorex brand but have never had a problem with verbati
i do n't think i would have used my i5 without this i just wish it came with the gps instead of having to buy it separately great to easily move my gps from car to car highly recommend
a great solution to theft prevention for this gps the legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box
the reader is fast example i took 56 2mp images from my camera recently i plugged this reader into my g4 , plugged in the card , the card mounted , i dragged the images to my pictures folder , and they copied immediately no waiting i was amazed , because with my mia usb reader , it could take a while to transfer that many images , over a minute a copy dialog did n't even pop up , because it transferred so fast it does n't hurt that it 's a cutie too 5 stars
it 's a canon product made for another canon product how can you go wrong \?
good printer ink , always try to use factory ink and these are with a good price i bought all the colors and paper at the same time all good price and free shipping save gas driving to local stores
operation of the sony dvpnss550 b single disc dvd player has been straight forward picture quality is very good , and the desired basic features have functioned without problems in other words , in the 2 1 2 months since we have owned this player , quality and reliability have been high price too was very reasonable that means durability is the last quality to consider , which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years but we wo n't know that for years
these mini cd rs work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only 42 cents apiece
this is a great multi function printer scanner copier fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload
as long as i own a pair of these headphones , i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again they sound perfect i cannot fathom a more balanced , natural sound these babies put you in the recording studio , or in the concert hall ! bass is crisp , taut , and strong you can feel it yet it is not overbearing or boomy midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist , and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes the folding feature is handy
good sound for the price , and very durable discrete design i prefer the plug design to other headphones they do n't fall out , and i can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane , it makes almost no difference just be careful in the traffic \)
these earphones are excellent quality noise that gets in from outside is so low that i can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me in addition , the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones
i just got my nano last week and the minute i turned it on \( before even transfering any music to it \) i could hear a faint noise buzz from the nano it comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as i turn off the unit has anyone experienced this with theirs \? my first generation nano does not experience this noise i plan to take it to an apple store and try to get a replacement
i have never been a fan of the ipod i have been an iriver h120 , h320 , and h340 owner i had a toshiba gigabeat and currently own an archos av500 the reason for owning a nano is because of the size of the av500 it is too big to pack around unless i am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on the nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote , \( soon \) , i am very happy with it it loads from itunes very easily and i have had no problems with it not playing certain files , \( and i would reencode them if there was a problem \) apple , do n't let me down
the koss pro 4aa 's were not made for ipod mp3 headphone users to begin with , they reveal the low fidelity of mp3 files \( compared with lp 's or cd 's \) also , they require a 1 4 to 3 5mm \( or other \) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment
bought this mouse over 3 months ago , and its still going strong the batteries last forever \( i 've never replaced them yet \) my only problem is that at times , i will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom , but it wo n't seem to turn off ! i reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again , and this always does the trick other than that , very ergonomic , extremely smooth and precise
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop the usb just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse , i ca n't
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well
my first purchase of the q9b resulted in a return as the display was n't mounted properly within the plastic housing this resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1 4 and made the viewing unpleasant the screen also was n't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100 having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it suffice to say , quality control missed this one
you idiot , its not only for psps the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot phones cameras psp tvs computers
after ordering non oem inks from several different places on the web \( and having some problems with them \) , i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices
hp did n't make 13x19 paper when i bought my 13x19 hp printer way to go , hp they may make it now , but i never check , b c i'm totally satisifed w this paper runs smooth and looks great
product was as described reception was strong and weak depending on your location was able to receive all frequencies rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy could get annoying on a very windy day radio is bulky and heavy
i have used gps units from cobra , garmin , and lowrance i consider this cobra unit to be one of the best i started with the cobra but it was stolen after a month then i bought the lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the cobra i returned the lowrance and bought the garmin 340
the unit operates as good as any other gps system available , plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches i am very impressed with the gps , but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed the unit falls off the window and from the dash , plus the power cord comes out too easily the unit deserves a five star rating , but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 , 2005 businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article
if money was no object , i would prefer the totally wireless headset phone , however , this has been a great alternative i have tmj , and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck , while holding my toddler , while preparing dinner , compound my pain go figure ! i find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain , but , the product works great i have had no problems hearing anyone , nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me the earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off , even for someone with elfishly small ears like me !
i 've owned this headphone for about a year now , and i 've got to say , after going through multiple headphones , this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke \( i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon \) , i 'll surely buy another one again !
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer i have w2k at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2 never had any type of compatibility issue this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon
i am very pleased with the quality of the product i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters after the rebate , the price was very competitive
hey , do n't listen to those other schmucks so maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable , but the rest just complain too much i love this thing ! i got it for christmas , and now for 20 , you ca n't beat that i use a standard charger for it in my car , so i never have to worry about batteries it seems that the best way to get it to sound the best , is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using \( equalizer \) i have also used it on my portable dvd player in the car and it sounds awesome ! for the price , i highly recommend this product
i 've used the keyboard mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish of course , any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard mouse setup , but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish
i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish \( odd , i know \) , i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively inexpensive this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch , in quality , my larger studio size headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone , rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case , means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games 5 stars
after buying my ipod , i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock , which is about 300 , your better off only spending about 25 and getting just as good quality
i was unsure at first if this product would work with my ipod nano , but after checking out griffin 's website , i decided to go ahead and order it it works great ! i like to play solitaire and read text files on my nano , so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if i did n't use the screen so much tunejuice means i do n't ever have to worry about that again i just keep a couple of 9v batteries with me , and i can keep listening , playing , reading or whatever on my nano as long as i want love it
i have been using my sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures i have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i did n't want to spend the money on this either , but it is better i really do n't know why , but it is no question about it perfect picture and sound ! i have a yamaha rx v2700 receiver which has hdmi hookups i tried a hdmi cable that came with my directv box \( from my toshiba hd dvd player \) and it was seriously lacking this hookup is much better ! i have a monster cable hdmi hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my sony 46 flat panel as well \( more but \) i'm finally satisfied i'm watching \( and listening to \) batman begins \( in true hd sound \) on hd dvd and it is superb ! ! ! ! this is just awesome ! the stuff of fantasy you only have to buy this these cables once , so why not buy the best \? ! i highly recommend this move
this remote will do everything you need or want simple to use and great customer service i had a couple of glitches \( buttons that did n't work quite right \) when i first programmed the device , but the harmony support team helped me through those areas the changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the harmony web site so if i ever need to , all i have to do is reload the info
i paid about a dollar for this holder holds and protects the ipaq nicely can hold some credit cards as well as id overall a decent product for a low price
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop it 's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks i have been pleased with apc products for about six years they provide excellent customer support i highly recommend their products
it also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time i 've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle \( out of two that come with it \) still looks almost full if the price was a little more consumer friendly i 'd give it five stars i mean come on when you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50 pack of cd r 's for less than 14 , the profit margin on something like this is probably 200 or more
i found this keyboard to be very helpful i am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers while my laptop can be used to type , when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable this keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing the bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if i would like without stopping the connection i would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it overall , a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier
i had it now for 12 months and no problems with it its tiny lightweight and great speed my old computer has to work quite hard to recognize it , but my laptop has no problems
have been using them for a week now
excellent sound , much much much better that the one that comes with any players , zens or ipod
i just recently move from dial up to dsl going dsl was not enough i did not want to have cables running though the house so i started looking into going wireless to make a long story short , after a little investigation i decided to make the leap into wireless technology i purchased the wap55ag router and the adapter cards , wmp55ag and wpc55ag
i am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone it looks good , but more importantly , it feels good button placement , weight , smoothness , everything was done well coming from wired mice , the lack of a wire is very freeing i am also especially happy with how small the usb radio receiver is i am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is
received this speaker as a replacement for the advent aw 810 which did not work at all this one was much easier to install and calibrate ! very happy with range and sound quality highly recommended
these are very comfortable to wear , and the sound is great i use them out jogging , and they stay put , without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise , so be careful around traffic , as you cannot hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone
i bought these ear headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club the sound quality is acceptable , not exceptional the construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right that places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out i have no idea why sony thought that this was a good design for the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord i would give these a b good not great
the logitech cordless trackman wheel was purchased in sept 2006 i have had this for two months at the time this review is being written
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer it works just as well as the corded one when i'm in my office for travel , the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel it 's not a small , usb stick that goes in the back it 's a long , corded , mouse looking device that sends recieves the signal to the trackman i do n't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel all that said , i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
my canon 510 got glowing reviews just about across the board , but not this printer i have very little space , and needed something small just for photos so , even though there were many negative reviews i went ahead and bought it could n't be happier ! colour fabulous ! and when you print on stock paper you can use photo to do some extra artwork on i love it
product nicely made , looks like quality product and performs fine
my wife and i used the fr300 during the week long queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered one 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume the cell phone charger is cool , but it takes a lot of winding the light is good in a pinch , but not particularly useful
this map set met all my expectations , and was far more current than i had expected software for turn by turn directions on roadways while driving works great with the garmin ctrex gps recommended to load many states you will need large memory card , 1 gb
if you buy this service plan , print out the contract and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan , but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it
easy enough to pop off the normal ant \( roadmate 700 \) and pop on this magmount version and what a difference it made ! signals really are remarkedly improved highly suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you 'll get the birds
a lot cheaper than model specific docking stations , and 'does what it says on the tin' quite stylish too , as docking stations go
we used the gtx600vp4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling the 5 watt power gave us ample range does it reach 18 or 20 miles , do n't know but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains it 's a great way to stay in touch when traveling the batteries are rechargeable , both a c d c the ear pieces were very good for privacy very easy to use and well worth the price a good investment
i was hesitant to get this , since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception now that i bought it , i'm very glad i have it it does all the things you might want in a disaster , inluding a flashlight , red flashing light \( especially if your car breaks down at night \) , a siren \( if you 're trapped in a building \) , ac , battery , and crank power , and multiple radio bands while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations , in a disaster , you only need a few stations , as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news between the am , fm , tv , and noaa bands , my radio will received a huge number of stations many more than would ever be needed in a disaster \( i did n't try the cellphone charging function \) it comes in a carrying case
i just recieved my hdmi cable and am very impressed the price is just what it should be about 5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over 100 for this cable at a store the service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days ! i highly recommend this cable i just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the tv and wow what a great picture all around the color is just so much more vivid using hdmi compared to component 3 wire connectors get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others
this is the perfect keyboard \( i know cuz i am typing on it right now \) i recommend if you like media boards
sandisk has done it again they never seem to let me down with their products i was in the market for another memory chip since i kept filling up my smaller 128 mb chip the price was the deciding factor for me , as being a college student the financial situation was tight but this product was perfect , right price , excellecnt storage space , good name get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
fast shipping , very happy with the garmin their tech support is good they answer all questions will buy from amazon again will buy a garmin agai
this is great ! my only problem is the knob for adjusting it 's to loose
i bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a 9 99 mouse , and i 'll never turn back this mouse is outstanding for gaming it 's pretty damned accurate , and it easily fits in my hand good price , too
i you own a smartphone , you 'll need one of these also happy this came with an adapter card , to plug in the microsd into it to move data from my mac to the phone
the sandisk 1gb micro sd card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging i installed it in my motorala razr v3m as expanded memory for my music library be sure to remove the razr battery to clear the access slot for the micro sd the v3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems i used motorola phone tools to transfer my entire music library the program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer the entire music library a full 1gb transferred reasonably quickly the v3m is slow to access my music using menu function 3 under get tunes tones function 6 manage music accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well the new corded motorola syn1301b stereo earbuds work well in this configuration sound quality is surprisingly good , but the large diameter earbuds are flat not tapered and do not seat very well in the ear canal the sandisk 1gb microsd card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the v3m as cell phone with mp3 player
i upgraded from some speakers i purchased when i built my system the sound difference was wonderful it is a clean crisp fresh sound worth every penny
pros
okay so it was about 8 45 at night i was coming on to a 1 2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live i was doing 60mph , the speed limit is 40 as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small k band warning i instantly slow down to the speed limit as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph then it gets to full k band i look to my left where there is a service parking area , and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car as i pass the police car , i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead
this is my second escort passport 8500 x50 the first one is in another car it saved me many times for getting caught though i'm not maniac driver the detection range is very good , it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car i love the blue color and it only costs 30 more than red the only problem that i have experienced on my first one is sometimes i got laser false warning signals , especially on raining day with defog is on i heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes x50 pop and laser false warning signals , and my first x50 is in my turbo charged car i'm not sure if pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much , i have it turned off overall , it 's very good detector , you will get payback if you own one
the best headphones i ever had , good fit excellent sound on my soundblaster x fi ! !
i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below \( followed exactly \) there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase , i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 , this is what worked for me at any rate
works with ipod skin , no need to take off cover looks good has connections for audio , tv cables and remote are additional included are 5 adapters for all ipods that have doc connector
this is a great storage device i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse i love the lanyard , that helps me to keep track of the drive worth every i paid for it !
this is a very nice set of paper and envelopes the price is really great the paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double the colors come out very bright and the folding is easy overall it is a good deal
i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my 2 4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone , i can contact her to talk to her
i am extremely pleased with the purchase i am using it in my office simple plug and play \( no brainer \) ! !
like most other reviews , i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit movies are amazing ! my music collection never sounded so good if you want to get away from it all for awhile , slip these babies in your ears and chill
i bought usb rudder pedals and yoke for use with x plane on a mac dual g5
i needed a simple solution for my office i wanted to be able to use the phone , but not get tied down by the handset , or the headset here was my solution , since the ts105b has the 2 5mm port for a headset , i purchased a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office so far wow ! ! ! its worked out great the phone is also good by itself , plus it was inexpensive through amazon for anyone interested in going the route i took you will not be disappointed
i have had this tv since mid march 2006 i absolutley love it ! ! i did extensive research before i bought a large screen tv and found that this samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck i read some reviews saying that dlp technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect , especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action one reviewer specifically said to try playing bourne supremecy to see an example of the rainbow effect this was the first dvd i played on this tv and i did not once have a problem with rainbow effect overall i have no complaints with this tv samsung has produced an excellent product i recommend either satellite or hd programming for the best picture regular cable comes in sort of grainy
there is a little story before this
this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag , and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset , ie turn off the headset , receiver and ipod all from the headset instead , i have to get the ipod back out , turn it off , turn the receiver off , then turn the headset off
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon , and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair \( took about 10 minutes to do , let it cure overnight \) headphones look ok , with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards \( reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses \) sound is very good \( better than most earbuds \) , they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever , and range is outstanding my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on , and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco , and they are only partially functional with the nano \( ca n't use the advance track feature of the headphones \)
i am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from case logic this is a great product and is manufactured well holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out i do n't transport them so i ca n't comment on that like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up get this if you need a lot of storage
this headphone extension is perfect ! it is not as long as described \( about 15 feet \) but that 's o k with me the connections are tight \( the plugs do n't pull apart \) it maintains sonic quality it also retains it 's elasticity using this extension cord my grado sr 60 's sound better than any wireless phones you wo n't be dissapointed !
this is a pretty decent cheapo case if you want something that you 'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs , then you may want to get something a little sturdier for my archival purposes , however , it works just fine
purchase service
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
this was by far the easiest computer peripheral i have ever setup ! works flawlessly with my netgear wireless router
it is remarkable that , even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence , none of them are near perfect i tried four different cases , both hard plastic and silicone variants , and the iskin case comes the closest , protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days love the service at amazon
these are the best period ! look no further because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes after 3 conversations with canon customer care , we decided it was not the printer , but the cheaper ink i switched back to canon , bit the bullet on the price , and everything is fine i found decent prices on amazon , particularly at eek industries
this is a nifty very small musical device that i use when exercising its great holds all the songs i can listen to and is so portable i really like i
i was so happy with my creative zen nano that i bought one as a gift i love the color choice and the sound is great love the pause button it came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band you do not need to buy one ! ! amazon delivered it in 2 days
this printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrived
this is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality
i'm using monster optical cable as well , but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf
sound quality is very good , and i have n't run out of battery so far the base is somewhat smaller than what i expected from the pictures the handsets are well designed on my previous phone it happened that the mute function became engaged when i kept the phone between my head and my shoulders this did not happen with these so far speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages answering machine works well easy to copy phonebook entries between phones
this does exactly what it is supposed to do it is light , easy to pack , easy to use , and probably difficult to crack
i tried both microsoft 's lifecam vx 3000 and vx 6000 had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core 3 00ghz cpu with 2 gigs of ram and , with both of those , the video lagged the audio \( distractingly so \) spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening \( got through on their toll free line \) and he pointed me to new software for the vx 6000 downloaded the 50 meg plus file , installed it , but the vx 6000 still produced out of sync video vs audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker
easy to operate and good focus just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
garmin ique m5
we bought this about a month ago from amazon the product itself seems fine we used it on a vacation drive from nj to myrtle beach and back at times , it was a help \( like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in va and we needed an alternate route \) however , you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it does n't always recommend the best or shortest route also , it was missing certain stores , restaurants , etc that had been around for awhile
this phone was an additional phone for the model ip811 2 phone system used for vonage this system has every feature that i could want , including range and quality , there are no negatives i am highly recommending this phone and system
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture you would n't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing i have shown it to an i pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the i pod
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap 76s to my hp laptop so far it has performed perfectly i have not tried to use it for other applications yet , so i ca n't comment on how well it would work in other situations
i find this printer to be better than hp or epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles , just a solid printer that performs as i anticipated
the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice , i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me
i bought four of these so far they appear to work well they do not work with compact flourescent lights well , but are fine with incandescent bulbs
i bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17 hyundai l90d \( which is a great low priced screen for gaming \) , which was the replacement for a dell fp2100 \( that i gave to my wife \) anyways , this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times \( more than enough for my flight sims \) movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution has n't been a problem the design is probably the neatest looking out there \( subjective i realize \) the only gripe i have w this monitor is lack of swivel \( sigh \) other than that i'm very pleased with everything about this screen
wow just got one of these at a great price , hooked it up to my mac g4 via a dvid cable , and it boots up at native resolution \( 1680 x 1050 \) automatically no muss , no fuss text is crisp and clean
my favorite thing about this phone is that the caller id captures 11 digit numbers \( 1 xxx xxx xxxx \) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call my old phone only captured 10 digits \( xxx xxx xxxx \) which meant i had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first this new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number i put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in very handy as far as being a phone , it does everything well and after a couple of months i am still as happy as could be with it
this is the rockinest think i 've ever seen or buyed dudes ! ! ! check it ou
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking , hiking , kayaking , and in the car to i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
ok here 's the deal i 've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years i love my magellan i 've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface \( the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me \) and how the menu structure was built
i had been talking about wanting an mp3 player , but i did not want an ipod , as i heard you cannot add files in windows format and that 's what all of my music is i received this e260 4 gb mp3 player for my birthday in june 2006 , and this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned although there are a few little quirks , overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this mp3 player
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i 've never written a review , but i 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other amazon buyers , so i felt a really good product like the anycom bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review
i was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer the photo output is awesome and it 's very fast !
i'm a skeptic no , i mean i'm really a skeptic especially in today 's marketplace \( because nothing is built like it used to be \) i do n't buy anything without checking it out first , and even then , i expect that it 's probably going to fail me when i do yeah , wonderful view there , huh \?
the sound of these earbuds are great and they are a value for the price
using this kingston chip on my pearl 8100 phone and it has worked flawlessly
i work in a computer lab where we constantly re image devices \( using norton ghost \) i have 3 laptops and 1 dell gx620 desktop and all of them have gigabit connection when i connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous , i get the same performance \( 0 differences \) as i run 1 laptop to the gx620 this testing was done with cat5 cables that i pick randomly from my lab i ca n't wait to add more devices and using cat6 cables to get my work done faster
the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car however , the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs the 9 feet using the gps 's internal antenna when in an open area garmin 's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around \( on my gps \) i feel the antenna was worth purchasing
i use the suctions mount antenna because i remove from sight whenever i leave my car which is idea for my purposes the antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock the only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up
this unit has a v in my thought was that one could play video games on it , or view images from a camcorder digital camera however , all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen so it does not allow me to do all i wanted it is also a bit on the loud side if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit i got one of those also , and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor it also does not make much noise
this is a great swicth with low price i use it together with d link di 704 4 port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 pc , two servers , one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp connecting via the swicth for internet sharing does n't show any noticeable slow response as compared to connecting via the router directly it works well by itself as we as with d link di 704
i would highly recommend this phone set easy to program and crystal clear reception a definite 5 star
works well with canon 10d , 30d , and s40 fairly fast write speed and 4gb pretty big \( 1600 jpgs in the 30d ! \)
for the epson photo 1270 , the photo quality and color are excellent i have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer
this product was very easy to set up hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time been running 3 months with no problems what so ever would highly recommend
i am amazed by the quality of the guitar the product is extremely good the service by amazon was ultimate thanks a lot amazon
since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas , i recommend you get this one depending on type of your ipaq \( 1900 series vs 3000 series \) , you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case once you 're done , however , it 's very easy to use and carry it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket , unlike so many other cases the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface , this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection \( klutzes be warned \) the leather feels surprisingly good , almost a lambskin kind of quality the credit card space is not very useful , but you can shove a couple of business cards in there a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
this is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers you do n't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming ! excellent travel accessory
works exactly as advertised i travel a lot and i can finally enjoy those long travel hours in planes calmly
unit 's range shorter than expected , but i feel that i got what i wanted , and paid for shipping and delivery were great
i was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both ! ! it 's very easy to learn and enter stuff i'm a first time pda owner and this is an excellent product !
if you originally newly unlocked a new locked mapsource cd rom dvd rom product on or after the release date of an update for that same product , you are eligible to unlock on that specific update what you unlocked on the original for no charge in other words , you can update to the latest data for free ! visit the garmin web site for more inf
if you 're looking for isolation from ambient noise , these are great i use them as in ear monitors for my onstage use \( rock band \) , and if i use the foam inserts , i can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off
i found this on clearance at another retailer \( i guess not everyone likes pink \) , and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for skinny armed people , but not so ! i 've got plenty of room , it fits great , and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way , though makes mowing the lawn way more fun
the phone works great ! i have three of these and a base the best phones i have had the other phones i have are the tcx800 model \( previous version \) , equally good
i just use the keyboard like a business user i do n't use the media stuff i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works i like that it 's not huge and does n't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use the rechargeable mouse is handy as well prior to this , i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row , and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me i do n't know if it 's because it 's logitech or it 's bluetooth , but the keyboard mouse are as responsive as were they wired \( after they wake up \)
i used the tripp lite to charge my powerbook and digital camera during a cross country trip to grad school it worked great and i had no problems the only thing i could have used was a second outlet
esactly what i was wanting when you turn there is resistance \( springs i think \) and everything works great if you use flight sims you need this product works awsome
nicely designed leather case w belt clip i bought this for my hp hx2415 pockets good for sd memory cards belt clip hooks very tightly to belt , so you do n't have to worry about dropping pda
este estuche lo compr para mi ipaq hx2415 y es muy c modo de llevar porque no es grande y adem s el equipo se mantiene seguro por el dise o que tiene
this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need as a chronically disorganized person , the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings the strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic , so shocks are well absorbed
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
great sound quality great signal quality i can hear everyone well , and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well the main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger , with a couple walls in between , and i have no problems with signal
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you do n't have big hands it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely , even if you are left handed the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who do n't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward , backward , and switch between programs the button in the middle though \( the one that lets you switch programs \) is out of the way it takes just a bit more effort to use , meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button i actually hardly ever use that button i ca n't live without the forward backward buttons though i find myself man handling other mice thinking they too have those neat , little buttons the mouse has a really good response to movement as well i 've used it for gaming as well , though i admit i'm not a hardcore gamer i really recommend this mouse i ca n't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
pros
i love it you can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
this is an excellent product if you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you i am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day i have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places the garmin gps 18 plugs right into the usb port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments i 'll admit nroute took a little getting used to \( for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you 're not going to find it \) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie instead of spelling hoover street you just type hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations a great buy for only 100 bucks ! if you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of gps , dont spend 500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome gps sensor for only 100
obviously , there are far better printers on the market but if you 're looking for a quality 3 in one in the 100 to 150 range , this one seems to be at the top of the pack
since i 've seen musicians use jbl speakers for their concerts , that gave me a trust in their product with that , i became an owner to a desktop jbl pc cpeaker this product has been satisfactory and by far i have no complaints from it
note this is a review of the targus pa225u retractable phone ethernet cord \( plastic casing \) it 's the rectangular model , not the oval shaped one
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well
i just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup i had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck however , with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear it is so small and just excellent great work , logitech
i have the canon mp500 printer and canon rebel xt camera both capable of producing amazing results , but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers if you are looking to print out very impressive photos , then i would recommend getting the 8x10 photo plus glossy definitely nice enough to frame and with plus glossy , you 're definitely saving instead of paying to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my mp500 and printed using plus glossy , and the print is significantly better than the original
i tested my new canon i960 with a variety of papers like most printers , the output is much better when using the manufacture 's own paper \( as opposed to the cheaper generic paper \) , but there is no need to buy the most expensive pro paper as neither i nor my wife could discern any difference between the two there may be a benifit to the pro paper that cannot be seen \( lasts longer \? \) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your canon printer \( i think they look better than the ones i get from the photo lab \)
i 've had this for at least 8 months now we 've used it with xd , sd , memory stick pro , pro duo \( with the adapter \) and a few misc cards that friends' cameras may be using
this reciever is great ! it even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building i have played with many gps units and have yet to see a reciever do that this is a definte buy it is extremely accurate also i highly recomend it
the gps works in both my dell axim x5 and in my hp compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card i have used it with ms streets and trips and arcpad
you know , shrek 2 is the embarassment of american culture what 's wrong with it you ask \? let 's see too much slapstick humor , too many movie references , or parodies , and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying classic disney characters ! ! ! that 's just unbelievable , dreamworks ! disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry , and you just make fun of them that 's a real shame you should be thanking disney for all what animation offers nowadays disney classics have heart , humor , and a beautiful story shrek 2 lacks that shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility , never to be seen again ! !
when the lead character acts like she 's sleepwalking through the entire film , that 's distracting ! when just about anyone from my high school 's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth , then it 's time to open up the wallet , and hire better talent
this dvd was horrible i did n't know what to expect but after the first 10 minutes i was thinking is this it \? ! what 's going on \? where are they \? what am i watching \? after awhile i clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary nothing they do n't even tell you where they are \? ! it 's basically a 45 minute music video and the music , although i like it , does n't fit with the footage at all i really do n't understand the point of this project i watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding total waste of time and money and i am a jack johnson fan
during a missing persons investigation , a cop samuel l jackson gets kidnapped by a gang of thieves meanwhile , an elaborate bank robbery is about to go down of course , samuel does great as always , but the script and especially the very slow pace brings it down what sounded like a good movie turned out to be a dissapointment far from being the worst movie you can rent , but , it's just not as good as it sounds maybe next time , they won't take all day to get started
i started liking this movie , i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out , if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal underground cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late if you like the depressing , gritty , wild , fastpaced style of this movie , check out the original master robert crumb , toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of this is crap in noncomformity , and dont say i didnt get it , i just think hes being hugely self indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry , lacking the wit , psychedelia , and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly
this film is one of the worst i 've ever seen amatuerish in dialogue , acting , plot direction etc etc sure it 's bubblegum for late at night but it 's really breathtakingly awful
i found this dvd to be very slow there is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long most of this time is spent talking , not streching
this is the kind of morbid vulger trash that warner brothers does now with them it 's a show that is full of sex , graphic content , and a life style that is really damging to one 's mental and physical health this show and it 's studio are no better then disney and their desperate housewives show that treats women like call girls it 's all represents a hollywood that is out of control and completely gone off the edge i condem them both
this director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art artsy fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about speaking russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort
this has got to be the biggest stinker in denzel 's long movie career , just after the oscar winning philadelphia , he went on to star in this cult sci fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game , russel crowe also stars in this very , and i mean very bad movie but hey , if you 're a sci fi fan , watch this , but do n't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars on account , this movie did n't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the hollywood critic , the only movie with two lead star to not hit the box office this low budget sleepy movie is n't worth watching , if you love sci fi , that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race , pick up a true 5 star hollywood material like , 'a i' , 'terminator' 'i' , 'ii' , 'iii' or will smith 's new movie , 'i , robot'
where to start with this bad movie \?
i am referring to the laser light dvd edition of this film , which promises the best digital transfer of the film that is great , but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer ! i taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version i taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv ! in reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better vhs version and i would recommend that over this do not be fooled like i was with the fine condition of welles' the trial by laser light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this this version of arkardin is a total waste of money
i thought this video was really going to encourage my toddler to use his potty but it did n't this video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty i was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty this video did n't do it , so i'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning todlers need visuals and actions , the bear on this video does more talking than actual actions
the award winning documentary freestyle , looks like something fresh , creative , and new from the exterior i was psyched to purchase this dvd the minute i heard about it
fyi this is the retail friendly edited version of guys gone wild heatstroke to show less raunchy material , making it acceptable at mainstream retailers be sure to get heatstroke instead if you want the full uncensored version of this title
totally disappointed whole series is a joke should be call guys act stupid amature editing and directing
okay , i own a britney album or two but the girl really let herself go she should have stayed in school , instead of the mickey mouse club or at least beauty school or something , then she might have known that the hair she has now is hideous i know i'm not the only one who thinks she 's turing into trailer trash except , she 's got money that hair \? her clothes \? and lets face it guys , she was putting on weight way before she got pregnant fashion senses aside she 's really more idiotic , that chaotic she 's got this princess in distress act that only her die hard fans ca n't see through i saw her in concert once , yeh i admit it paid for me and a friend to go was gonna go see the onyx hotel tour too , just because but when i saw it on showtime , i was so glad she canceled the tour and i got my money back her vocals were horrible , and it was so bad when mtv picked it up and they were obviously doctored she has absolutely no talent whatsoever and her vision is incredibly lacking her bland personality and complete naiivity and idiotic behavior makes itself evident in this show that is n't even bareable for a minute
this late keaton material when the actor desperately needed funds is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with keaton rolling in his grave at this release
i did n't find this dvd too bad to watch , but i would n't watch it again it had tons of good artists but i dont wanna have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews i think this dvd needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin , just my opinion
i love asian movies i like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of hollywood these days 2047 however , was the first asian movie that i failed to finish becaase of the sheer boredom of the plot do n't get me wrong , the main actor \( clark gable look alike \) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous , but the movie itself imo is overrated you can argue art all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you \( not my bag at all \) i kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to realize oh my god it 's not over ! boring
what 's all the fuss about ms hepburn does n't act our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time eddie albert 's restraint is utterly unbelievable any two bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions ! what is peck left with \? a long life of knowing he 's got a girl friend he ca n't touch , see , or speak with
this is without question the worst movie ever made it makes plan 9 from outer space look like 2001 roger ebert must be a genius no one could accidentally make a movie this bad i guess it 's a comedy that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny
five gen x yuppies \( yup , they 're old enough to be that now \) reunite for the funeral of one of their friends what ensues is a parody of the big chill , complete with bad 80s music then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one , turning them into murderous zombies so far , so eccentric , and the satire is sometimes very funny the fx are so bargain basement , however , and the plotting so loose , that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half hour after a rather promising set up zach galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie
this product is way outdated for todays advanced technology it is appropriate for crt tv 's but not for lcd 's very disappointed ! !
i like sandler
'the sword and the sorcerer' released in '82 is a mixed bag of positive and negative
except for the presence of kevin bacon , whom i like a lot , this would have been a real loser there were so many things wrong directed by paul glaser with no surprises , no depth of character , a too heavy handed hollywood scenario you knew what was coming a mile away there was good cinematography and music , and kevin bacon is always appealing , but that 's the best i can say oh , and the nun she was pretty good too the lead black man was also engaging the problem was really the script too pat , and too many unbelievable things that screamed hollywood like when the village burned down they were ready to just up and leave where they 'd lived for generations as if it takes generations to rebuild their houses and there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game and bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain , get cut in the groin , then play basketball , all on a rotten knee please
lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out , ot it 's me that im losing the charm for watching movies and it more into the first one
i hate to be the dissenting voice here , but the boost is one of the most hilariously bad , cliched and over the top pictures i 've seen in a long while it 's so silly it unintentionally wanders into john waters territory several times the thing is , james woods acts like he 's on coke before his character starts doing coke , so when he actually starts the coke binge , the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness still , it has its moments , such as sean young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage , or woods explaining that cocaine just takes your natural energy and amplifies it a good title would be national lampoon 's cautionary cocaine tale of the 1980s
this movie does a very good job of portaying an alcoholic that has not yet found the program of alcoholics anonymous the aa meetings in this movie are packed with self centered selfish and restless , irrtable and discontented people who meet to share their misery real aa meetings offer experience , strength and hope , and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director to bad this one is n't a very good story
antonio banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you ca n't believe he ever got wealthy when he 's running around giving money freely to a woman \( angelina jolie \) who lied to him from the moment they met she did n't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl , so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry well , we never get to see the pretty girl , because jolie must have killed her too the only reason this woman is hot is because she 'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody \( if you 've seen gia , you 'll know what i mean \) neither she or banderas \( who is n't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent \) have any chemistry , and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her my guess \? the age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed , and all the sex in this movie gets old fast it 's so stupid , because nobody has interludes like that unless they 're shooting a blue movie the only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot
can someone please tell me where to get the re mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles \? the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio , or english audio , but no english subtitles !
this film itself deserves 4 stars at least im givin this s a one cause its a f bootleg i tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an x box and it would not play then when i finally got it to play , it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like s if your into purchasing s like that then i guess this is for you i advise you to cop this movie somewhere else
i just finished re reading the book it is a masterpiece i wish i could say the same for the bbc series for one , the musical score is either absent or irritating so much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the characters how about voice overs or something else \( music \? \) \? let the audience in on the torment and conflict of raskolnikov \( the main character \) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book what i saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film i 've written much more but it 's unfortunately been truncated simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book this is a dreary protrayal
i thought that this movie would be pretty interesting the previews for it made it seem like it was funny i however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid the charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground also the running time was too long , it says it was just a little over 2 hours , but to me it felt like much more
this is i suppose anybody who 'd hire adam sandler and or tea leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from cro magnon man could watch i lasted 20 minutes the jokes are older than me , and they were n't funny when they were born
when danny devito 's plays larry garfield he is like taxi 's louie de palma of wall street
teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross i can understand implying that two ex cons have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie with cheap double entendre and to stoop so low as to give a lead male character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous \( ok , director we 'get it' all men are secretly gay ! you made your point , move on ! \) i ca n't even imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this film the least bit interesting much less stimulating \( for an intelligent crime caper with a same sex subplot see bound \) since this movie is supposed to take place in wisconsin they give the locals a southern accent an absolute bore
people that love this series are misguided at best it sucks i mean completely stinks i will be putting set on ebay
this is a terrible missues of one of asimovs greatest novels the relevance to the novel is only marginal
date movie should be shown non stop to all captured al qaeda prisoners only mass murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish let me be perfectly clear about this date movie may be the worst movie ever made it 's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of you may cry , you may scream , you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film , but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here not once it does n't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks the only thing i got out of this movie was an awful headache if you ask me , everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years if not for life had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to date movie , he would have stayed in the ocean
date movie is from two of the six writers of scary movie , apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter a few chuckles here and there but that 's all
do n't get me wrong i'm a fierce anti communist but the stupidity of this movie is just unbearable all the american clich s about russians and ussr are reunited here , and it should be studied at school as an example of gross caricature the ridiculous russian language imitations , the dissenters presented as freedom soldiers , whereas a child knows today they never used violence as a mean to achieve their goals , the jews presented as traitors \( the scientist 's wife looks like ethel rosenberg \) the idea of stealing so easily such a weapon , the reaction of secretary general \( and not premier \) , to send another firefox , whereas he could just use this incident to accuse the united states of stealing if you should see an intelligent cold war movie , check out white nights \( it 's a shame it is n't on dvd yet \) or the 7th protocol , far more intelligent than this gross , highly unprobable childish parody the chase star wars like scene is way too long and looks dated today clint eastwood , shame on you
i have seen other pokemon movies , but this was the worst the plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as i thought and mew does not fit in the story when it is about lucario
watching this movie , i am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible , and make it drag out on the screen the disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be , and how poor direction , and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness i wo n't even go into historical inaccuracies , or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject , the audience and history instead of respect
every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point as if you 're a short attention span coach potatoe ehhh , ah yes , you are well , watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does two or three nice ideas , the rest is very superficial and underutilized probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people what i would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire !
some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops , she 's sent to gymnastics camp \( she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker \) she thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid , she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time , it 's all her parents fault of course because she 's perfect , her dialogue consists of nothing but smart aleck remarks that she says in that oh so cute way that fans of lizzie mcguire may find clever good grief this is just beyond unwatchable even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old , and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds it just grates on your nerves until you 're about ready to shove the dvd through the paper shredder
i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway worst film ever , i dont care if this did'nt help you , this film p ! ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review how is it meant to be entertainin
i am a yoga instructor and i bought this dvd hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students this dvd is not a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title ! what i did see was a woman who was very flexible , quite possibly a dancer , doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements in most of the movements she taught , this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion
i remember taking a minute of my time to watch this dung when it premiered a couple years back , and lets just say i find watching something download more than this i swear i hate preps the most in this country
the last time i saw the names adam goldberg and giovanni ribisi together , they were two american soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain private ryan
for the idiot that wrote that day 1 for fifty was in 2003 stay in da south ur abviously dont know that fifty has been on the seen since 98 u idoit ur a fake rap fan and u should know ya history instead of talking on curtis jackson 2003 what a douche bag
the show is not so funny it repeats itself and it has too much music , dancing and intros for my favour watch instead mad t v or the chapelle show
when i first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty some years ago , i honestly thought it was a joke i mean , the young people in this 1938 b w film almost make ward and june cleaver look cool 1938 , is this right \? the three stooges were still new at that time if parents truly wish for their off spring to avoid blowing weed , they may not want to choose to show them this dvd it 's so hard to take seriously thank goodness there are n't any 'extra features' here i do n't think i could 've taken it 'reefer ' does have a sole purpose , to watch maybe every two years after dark when there is n't any thing good on tv
flightplan , or flightpanned is implausible posturing and shrieking its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness you know where the movie is going within 20 minutes and just like a real plane flight , you spend the rest of the time waiting for it to end
most of the characters in this movie are great , the scenes , the costumes and everything but i did n't like the outcome of the story i felt daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and i could n't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl to be honest i never liked gwendolyn 's character at all , she was selfish , self centered and annoying , yet towards the end i felt very sorry for her , after all she 'd gone through for daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them
despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie , this is really pretty sick stuff , with little or no redeeming social context objectively , sick just is n't erotic , no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so those who think differently really ought to either \( a \) focus a little more \( b \) examine their true motives or \( c \) get a life
how i made it through this poorly executed , poorly written sequel , i have no idea catherine 's in trouble again and people she meets are dying who 's the murderer , catherine , the shrink who lusts over her , or the cop who 's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key \? catherine certainly gets around she manages to befriend the most unlikely of people , all associates or ex wives or enemies of the shrink , and most of them end up dead is she trying to drive the shrink nuts , or does she plan to kill him \?
from a big jt , brit , and x tina fan this dvd is soooo disappointing the dvd is comprised of whole episodes of mmc and very little of the episodes has britney , justin , or christina featured there is only one song where brit and justin sing \( a duet \) , and only one where christina sings other than that , all they basically show are lame hometown profiles which last about 60 seconds each you get better content from a behind the music or driven episode there 's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely nothing to do with britney , justin , or christina lame , lame , lame , and disappointing i think the total on screen time of real content is about 12 minutes save your money
they should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre this series should have been killed off by now the first was not even worth watching ! stay away from this whole movie series
being a texas chainsaw fan i of course picked this one up it has 2 big stars in it , and was directed by one of the writers of the original i'm not sure what they were going for in this one is it a horror , a sick comedy \? it is all over the place what is worse is that they made leatherface a wimpy crossdresser the ending leaves you scratching your head mathew and renee do their best with the material
this is my vote for 3rd worst movie ever made
qd3 has put out some good product before but thid dvd is kind of weak the roxanne battles , epmd , krs nelly , canibus ll , and ice cube vs cyprus hill was dope but the dvd feels incomplete the grandmaster caz vs the sugarhill gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie i would love to hear big ban hank try to refute what caz says the royce d12 beef was obviously a replacement for the eminem source beef and word is the source punked them out of using the footage
in my humble opinion , the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars , e g the corvair , buscemi 's caddy and cuervo 's 1959 buick
this film had a few laughs but was pretty run of the mill pauley shore pretty much did the same role over over but this film had a alright charm to it for a few minutes i saw it again recently after some years it had the same vibe to me then as now
i do n't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length once again cheap fox wo n't buy the music rights there is sections \( i think \) that have been either doctored or just cut out you 'll be watching an episode and you 'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment you 'll think it 's your eyes but it 's not thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color even though my review is n't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t v so they 're all still worth buying
i really dont understand how people find this show funny maybe back in the day it was something hot , but now its not
yul brynner stalks about like he 's in westworld , acting super tough , smoking every chance he gets steve mcqueen , as always , is terrible as for the rest of the 7 , their acting is atrocious to non existent only eli wallach walks away unscathed yet if these things are irritating , it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous yul brynner actually says that he might rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically amazing this could have ever been construed as being tough it 's just ridiculous , and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames but i 'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed
not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable it has none of the living comic book charm that i loved in the first one that and there are only three stories and more animation only the blob in the water one was worth watching if you see it , watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo ! funny romero and king seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one
3 short films \? ! \? ! \? thats it \? \? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used ! it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this chief wooden head isnt scary at all if you think that is scary , you are easily frightened the raft is defiantely the best on here by far that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit especially the ending to it ! ! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says thanks for the ride lady over and over i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead that one is better
well if this movie had a story then i must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it they do n't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that 's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking \( as one of the reviewer declared \) about 2 people having sex
their music is great , the videos are n't the most amazing thing i 've ever seen i listen to the b boys quite a bit , but i do n't find a video dvd to have much replay value
this line , spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie \( believe it or not \) and it only got worse christie 's character diana scott marries an italian man who hello , is old enough to be father ! and oh yes , he 's an aging prince \( in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana almost made me laugh \) that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv \( a la elvis presley \) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man \( three words anna nicole smith \) also , i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress \? she did n't at all because it should \( and i mean should \) of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music \( my pick for the best movie of the 1960 's \) because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins , for which she won the oscar , she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there 's a problem with the academy they ca n't seem to pull the trigger in giving back to back oscars to the same person
if you own or have watched the blue planet series you 're going to recognize all of the footage why \? because you 've already seen it except this time it 's going to be without the informative narrative
i did n't think of it much as a movie as i did a porn frenzy i'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know caligula was nuts otherwise , then i guess so was all of the roman empire i simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy it was stupid , simple and as soon as it was done i immediately threw it out not for the faint of heart not for the sophisticated either or anywhere in between
this is the most tedious , unfunny , overrated movie of all time it 's interesting that this is from the same man who produced spaceballs , which was actually rather humorous \( though also quite tedious at times \) i 'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it 's so funny his utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold
has a pretty thin plot ice 'cave' man is
on the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama
first off i do not dislike adam sandler , i rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film , not so much because i like raunchy antics , but because of the underlying message adam sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this you can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting , farting etc , but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him , he is loyal to his fans and to his friends ever notice how he always gives jobs to rob schneider and dana carvey \? no one else does , that 's a good friend , also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich , evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films he never sinks to there level either , perhaps that is why ecn was such a creepy , deeply disturbing film , i cannot , in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies , what was he thinking \? early on in the film his character , a drunken loser , belches very loudly in a chinese restaurant ok i go take shower now says chinese waiter i wanted to take a shower too , very soon after that scene for starters mr sandler seems to think he is a voice over man , he is not his idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard one can barely understand he is trying to do a character , and he barely is also he is the voice of at least four of his characters , he is equally bad in each perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house , he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something , he coaches the kids basketball team , he has been for years , and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him , he is simply there to be lovable , and put upon , he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face \( as is the so called humor here \) the script calls for sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end , there is no real motivation for his bazaar , cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them he starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures , a menorah and a christmas thing , i forget what it was he is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one , but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence , he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink , i can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads , surly , even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book not here of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go the film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous , mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms he goes to the basketball game and insults the children , ridiculing one boy for being fat , the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants nice kitty kitty he squeaks , what the \? \? \? \? then an angry father gets on sandlers bad side \( his only side \) and is force fed a jock strap i hope you like them extra sweaty ho ho ho for the next part of the film which seems like eight days , crazy or otherwise , his house is burned , he pushes his benefactor down a hill , in a porta potty which freezes feces on him , he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him , on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth we are treated to this twice god bless us , every one by the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs , each worse then the last , fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad if i move my bowls without using the spray that 's a technical foul is one of few lines i remember , thank you god by reading this one might assume , as i did , that this is irreverent in the good way , poking fun at old christmas standards , but it is not it is disgusting , badly written , annoying and very , very cruel the two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly , for no good reason with no motivation or payoff , the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand , this is not always a bad thing of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk , a childhood trauma involving a car crash on hanukkah , he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after the same cannot be said for the audience why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate , who is the audience \? there are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place , the over all feel of the film is one of depressed sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness adam sandler has been loyal to his friends , his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was , even if it hurt his feelings this christmas turkey wo n't even work as leftovers bah humbug
i bought this dvd because amy jo johnsen is in it \( one of my favorite actresses \) what i expected was a decent vampire movie , with some blood and guts , and a good storyline what i got was a movie with talking , talking and more talking , and a boring storyline i saw hardly any action , hardly any fun , and hardly anything interesting i was extremely disappointed in amy for starring in such a boring , unintriguing movie the only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between seth and viki 's ex it was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations , and useless talking
although deleted scenes are promised on the back cover of the box , there are no deleted scenes on the dvd instead there 's a perfunctory documentary which interviews the cast and other creators , who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film in this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that are n't in the film , but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that hopefully will be in the dvd deleted scenes section
all 4 movies in this set are dubbed in english i was horribly disappointed dont make the same mistake i did find the dubbed ones
i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake , i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film , but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch
i was very disappointed in this dvd it was a dvd for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds the dvd was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details the ability to view details of color and details of wing , tail bands , etc would have offered a much better learning tool it also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations
unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds , this dvd is otherwise a waste of money spend the extra money and buy the life of birds
picasso is one of the giants in the history of art and surely the artistic genious of the 20th century , but this renders him boring and repetitive it was done while he was alive , and has him painting little cartoon like works that were done only for this dvd one after the other ad nauseum this is picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist , not the edgy artist genius of les demoiselles d'avignon and guernica it looks as if he 's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work i turned it off after 30 interminable minutes fortunately i rented it on netflix , which i 'd recommend , rather than buying it
ok , i am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as vampire assassin then i run into another bad movie lets face it , this movie totally blows and what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects \? what was eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie , she was n't even the main star more like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it
this review is based on the differences between the standard dvd disc and the superbit version only based on that , i recommend that you save your money and get the standard version you 'll get more features , while barely losing any audio or video quality , which is the whole reason for buying a superbit disc in the first place i 've watched this movie on my 40 lcd sony xbr bravia \( 720 dpi \) , an oppo upscaling dvd player , and 5 1 sound system , and for this movie , i did n't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version so unless they 're selling this superbit version for 10 bucks or less \( which seems to be the trend since superbit discs may become moot now that hd dvd and blu ray discs are starting to come out \) , i 'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie , which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers
i saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull true story
so disappointing hardly a dark noir film , in my opinion just a proper hollywood murder mystery and there 's no sex , except brief kissing which lana always cuts short ! i'm a james m cain fan , and this does n't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel everyone 's too decent cora \( lana \) does n't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body , and she 's always costumed like a perfect fashion model , fingernail polish and all frank \( garfield \) is never lustful , never mean , never desperate always polite and decent not a gas station \( except for one pump that looks planted \) not a single oil can or wrench not a greasy spoon or diner , twin oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or b b , fit for donna reed family the 80 's nicholson mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark much more faithful to cain
i am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children , though i do not have any of my own on the whole i am unimpressed with the barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves
mission impossible , the tv series , told the adventures of the impossible missions force an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins , foreign dictators , terrorists and others who threatened the security of the united states rather than engage in james bond like shoot outs , the imf team worked together to covertly neutralize threats , leaving little or no trace of their involvement although the imf had a leader \( steven hill as dan briggs and peter graves as jim phelps \) , there was no star of the group just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective a truly groundbreaking show
i just whant to say this , if richard dean anderson is out of the stargate series so am i , and that 's it !
the plot of hard target has been summarized in previous reviews , so i 'll limit myself to discussing my favorite part
action director john woo 's first attempt at making a good american action movie fails with jean claude van damme \( bloodsport , sudden death \) on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars , punches venomous snakes in the head , hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass lance henriksen \( near dark , the terminator \) hey , when isnt henriksen a evil son of a bitatch \? yancy butler \( drop zone \) is van dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and wilfrod brimley \( tv's walker , texas ranger \) plays van damme 's southern fried canjun uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up all in all , it doesnt become the worst movie ever made , its only presence if the style john woo brings to his action scenes his lingo in the art of which he creates also starring arnold vosloo \( the mummy and the mummy returns \) as henriksen 's right hand man ah , gotta love the scene where van damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it ou
i guess i hold the minorty here in thinking the north and south maxie series is just the worst civil war mini series ever put on film they took great source material and turned it into days of our civil war lives , a soap opera of the most unwanted kind i found myself hopeing that maybe it would get better but it got more unbelievible as it went on just a waste of a great cast and a lot of money
given the cast i had high expectations for this movie , but unfortunately it did n't deliver the storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families there are some nice perfomances , granted , and for this reason alone i gave it two stars but even with that grace , it 's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch
what the he77 was that \? \? \? yo i tried cam , your music is straight and all but hang up the camera and pick up the mic stick to your day job \( rapping \)
you asked me to rate my transaction and or the product i ordered the transaction apparently did n't take place , since i did n't receive the dvd that i ordered is that what you wanted to know
a few comments about why i did n't like the video for my daughter
horrible
i actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years i tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in she did a great job , as always , just poor script writing it leaves a lot of questions unanswered , such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms , etc this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point \? i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed
this movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from russian captivity the film covers the experiences of a veteran german officer assigned as an advisor to a rumanian army corps on the eve of the stalingrad encirclement the film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of stalingrad one must think that it even disappointed it 's original german viewers of the 1950 's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of stalingrad and the nazi era
these 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in chinese cinema and definetly for jet li and movie kung fu
a girl buddy movie starring shelley long and bette midler as two women in love with the same guy when they learn that he 's used both of them , they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from new york to new mexico silly and dumb , with the usual chase fare thrown in everything is a cliche , from the opposing personality idea \( long is an orderly goody twoshoes , midler a loudmouthed mess \) to desert hippies to car chases , etc , etc the movie seems to go on endlessly
between the not so below average acting of thomas and biel , the film might have benefited more from a better script , but it did not there was nothing in this movie that they could have done better , it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much
this movie makes me want to vomit watching bio dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people
this movie would have been a complete failure if fred astaire had n't starred in it i found it to be exceptionally dull except for i lost my hat in haiti and you are , and footage from the actual wedding of a member of the british monarchy , this film is pretty terrible
trash film usurps title people that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to this must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old german film
why oh why do they keep placing redneck tim allen in christmas movies \? he ca n't act and he is disgusting i am ashamed at jamie lee curtis for reducing herself to this garbage i can understand tim allen thinking this was a good script , the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book with pictures but i had higher expectations from jamie lee curtis i have to say i usually love her but she was awful in this film she is reduced to whining and crying she does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her tim allen was awful from day one in his redneck middle america sitcom , and to this day retains that disgusting , overweight , burping middle america character
many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege this is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film i too loved this movie at a certain period of my life the period between my birth and when i turned ten that was when i read the book the book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created it has now been awhile since i first read it , but i still remember the excitement i felt with each new chapter i finished it in a few short hours since then , i have reread it several times , and each time it has been just as enjoyable it is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy my brother reads as little as possible , but even he loved it the movie , on the other hand , has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing it deters from the book in almost every way possible it makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting judy garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine , dorothy gale in the book , dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever in the film , she is whiny , cowardly , fretful , and slightly stupid she is also portrayed as being around fifteen making her this old distorts the book and her older age does n't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance besides wrecking the book , this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film do n't misunderstand me , i am a fan of musicals however , this film made for an atrocious musical practically every single song was annoying ! ! ! ! ! also , the somewhere over the rainbow number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book this brings me to the biggest , most awful , distortion of them all ! ! ! in the book , dorothy really went to oz ! ! ! ! ! not only that , she returned to oz several times in other oz books eventually , she even moved there to live ! ! ! in making the whole experience a dream , the entire story of oz was destroyed having said that , this movie receives a 1 in my opinion even so , i realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom if they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book , then the 3 disc dvd is the edition to purchase the features look good and the picture is restored as for me , i will spend my money on better things
not as much tap dancing as the other ones you probaly have to be irish to understand the theme because i did n't
i never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd , i was excited , remembering the magazine from when i was a kid and being a fan of ilc , snl , and comedy itself i am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others do n't i write this review now as i am trying to watch the third disc i got the dvd the first day it came out and i have to watch every dvd i get , even if i saw it before regardless to say , i only broke a smurk once throughout the first 2 1 2 discs i even tried watching parts of the disc when i was having a great day and even when i was not in the greatest of moods i was in a good mood again this morning so i started watching it i think it is the lamest show that i have ever seen i really do n't know why it ever lasted past the first season if you 've seen the show on tv and you like it , more power to you , if you have n't seen it , do n't buy it , it is a waste of money everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny i personaly do n't think i should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny
this is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name i will not even give this one to a student or friend put it in the goodwill bag
or you out of your mind ! i watched about 5 mins and i'm speachless that was the worse movie i ever started to watch and could n't get to the controls fast enough to turn it off throw them away , please
it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the tales from the darkside book the first one is lot 249 with christian slater , julianne moore and steve buscemi , which this one is the best with of course slater 's character then the next one is the cat from hell with william hickey and david johanssen , this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people the last one is a lover 's vow with james remar and rae dawn chong , it starts off good with remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects
do n't buy this junk , it is nothing more than trailers for 50 movies that the makers have deamed as the worst like another review said just look up a list somewere ! !
i love bad movies , so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i 'd give it a try
i found this film accidentially on amazon and was curious because i know welles did n't complete a great deal of films his directorial flourishes are definitely evident , but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer the picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad it looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so i could n't tell whether this was a bad dvd presentation of a mediocre film , or an awful movie put on dvd badly i did not shell out of the criterion edition , which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film
this is a potentially very good film interesting idea \( bearing some resemblance to angel heart \) sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer i do n't think i 've ever bought \( dvd or video \) or seen \( tv or cinema \) quite such an awful copy of a movie it is clearly stuck together from more than one original , with the logo delta appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner , but do n't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version the term special edition seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released ! ! ! ! ! tony curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue \( clearly from some late night cheap tv series \)
i bought orson welles citizen kane and liked it so i decided to watch other welles movies i bought mr arkadin because the dvd is cheap and rated high on imdb i should have buyed touch of evil instead the quality of the picture is laughable , sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes judging by the picture and sound quality i would say that they used equipment from the 30 's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the european movie industry of the 50 's sometimes the picture shake , during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we ca n't read everything the editing is very poor , there are too many scene changes when i bought this dvd i expected to receive the laserlight version , instead i got a dvd made by alpha video the case cover is different and there is no supplemental material he was mastered cheaply on a pc with the spruceup dvd maestro software , that seem to create problems , each time i try to play the disc on my computer the fbi warning message appear and then the disc eject i did n't notice any audio syncing problems however this movie is the perfect candidate for a remake i give for the story and for the overall quality of the movie
the weight of water \( kathryn bigelow , 2000 \)
i bought a copy of ntr for one reason and one reason only a single scene near the beginning , prominently featuring rosanna arquette this was the same reason i bought a copy of the wrong man , starring john lithgow and rosanna arquette discretion prevents my explaining further other than the scene already mentioned , i found the movie pretty worthless
the story is ok , but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much but if your looking for some raunchy sex there is a non simulated oral sex scene in it
added
well , nice cinematography as set designer work nicely interiors and well dressed actors maybe , visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once , but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year , as other reviewers trying to assure
i was so bored by this film that i thought i might be missing some subtle french cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting i asked a younger , french , female friend , who said she found it at least as boring as i did
as i remember when i watched the original chinese version , although it wasnt any big deal but i did like it as i remember , but this version is totally destroy that feeling , something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap , especially some sound effect why do n't they put the original track in it i hard can understand if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me it worth my 3 stars with the original trac
it did n't take me long to forget this film once again it stars jet in a strange role
not a good copy of this great movie i 'd wait and buy the restored authorized edition quot even though i bought this version , i 've ordered the other that 's how much i like metropolis is general
the bad

vol 3 marks a new low for family guy a season that started out strong but ended very oh my god , i was so shocked by that hahahahaha it seems to be riding on it 's laurels , so to speak , and it 's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny i do n't like it , and i think it 's been reduced to recent simpson quality meanwhile , the dvd has a few commentaries \( i 'd like to point out that the competition simpson dvd 's have commentaries on every episode , same with futurama \) some sub par special features the biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single layer , which means four episodes per disc , as opposed to the traditional seven we only get thirteen episodes of crap , and maybe we should be grateful , but all in all , whatever
i 'll get this out of the way i never liked the 80 's slasher films stuff like the halloween series , nightmare on elm street or friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much the idea of slow walking killers going after olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me of course the major draw was the death scenes elaborate moments of viciousness flinging jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it 's a good kind of laughing for some reason
jennifer love hewitt needs to fire her manager i 've yet to see her in a truly good role those terrible know what you did last summer movies , garfield , heartbreakers , if only , and many others were n't exactly memorable roles the truth about love does n't help bump her in that direction either not that i was expecting oscar quality when i looked at the back of the box , seeing a picture of her in a leather corset , i was n't going off of words to know that i was slightly interested in the movie i 've owned it for a few months now , and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and i were in the other room playing games she kept coming out every 5 minutes , and i could tell that she was n't that interested after giving in and watching it with her , i now wish we had all played resident evil 4 instead
when buying a product , you expect a little bang for your buck unlike its counterpart family classics , action classics leaves far short of its mark although these movies are old , you expect quality unfortunately , the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy you 'd think that because they 're on dvd , the quality would be better the movies shown are low budget \( b movies \) with unknown actors and limited action need i continue \? \?
this dvd is pretty bad i 've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the triple feature dvd
heavyweights was a quite a disappointment , considering the presence of ben stiller
the script and dialogue are lousy all this film has to recommend it is a pretty face and occasional scenes depicting flesh the lady is not very interesting to say the least nothing original this is a cookie cutter clone of a thousand other french movies about young women trying sex for the first time avoid
i do not like the format of the dvd at all i had taken several pilates classes before buying this dvd , but i found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end much of pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times , so with no reminder of what i should be doing in each pose i felt like i was being cheated out of a workout i do n't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form , so this dvd will be stored away while i learn the specifics of pilates elsewhere
a friend and i tried watching this film once again recently , but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant from the beginning , when katharine hepburn 's character destroys other people 's cars without a care , we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny the acting is fine , as could be expected from such greats as hepburn and cary grant but the characters are not sympathetic , fun or interesting grant 's character is an unassertive , spineless person who is easily dominated hepburn 's character is blindly selfish who could care what happens to them \? the one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard
let me start off by saying that i am a huge madtv fan and have been for years it is easily my favorite show of all time while i loved the complete season 1 released in 2004 , i think this dvd set is terrible why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent , and arguably the worst , seasons makes no sense to me of course this does have some classic sketches , impressions and characters on it , such as debra wilson 's oprah and mo collins' lorraine , but a majority of it is just random most of these sketches are n't some of the better ones who picked this list \?
i really enjoyed season 1 but from the look of this we 're never going to see other complete seasons released why release the best of seasons 8 , 9 , 10 when you 've never released the complete seasons \? what about complete seasons 2 , 3 , 4 , etc cabana chat with rodney dangerfield \? phil lamarr 's impressions of michael jackson , prince \? little hassan taylor 's greatest hits \? darlene mcbride \? vancome halloween \? the wash me video parody of alanis morissette \? lick my baby back behind video parody of britney spears \? the love muffin video parody of mariah carey \? the bush cheney rap video parody the ubs man goes to the video rental shop , etc \? afropuffs cereal \? the early madtv was a little savage at times but that 's what made it funny i feel it 's appropriate to issue the best after you 've put out the complete seasons of course maybe there were legal problems some of the humor was pretty savage ! i guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own

this is a movie directed and played by a guy with unsalvageable narcissus complex always dreamed himself as a modern day casanova in n y , just like that george kastansa character in 'seifield' , a big lover , a womanizer , a baldy forever young romeo almost all of the screenplays he wrote , the movies he directed , the characters he played were all like this i just do n't know how women would fall for him in the least sense and possibility , only if in his wet dreams this is a very nauseating movie all of his movies are almost the same , only the movie titles changed the only one i liked is his recent 'match point' , nothing else and i felt lucky this guy was too old to play that role now , otherwise , he would n't allow anyone else to play that ambitious murderer but him
i expected so much more , because it 's marshall , but regardless of where you purchase this , it's edited it 's pathetic this is eminem ! i understand you have a daughter mr mathers , but do not make all of us watch an edited concert this is probably the most ridiculous thing i 've ever bought there 's not even a warning that it 's censored you just buy it , pop it in your dvd player , and listen to a concert with mostly every other word jarbled up it 's a useless dvd there 's no point in buying it first encore , now this i 've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90 's as somebody from michigan , i saw him before he was mr cartier global super star buying skin treatments at barneys i 've never been more disappointed with an artist
i went and saw another film as i was so disenchanted with this one the opening had so little to do with the rest of the film i thought i was watching a preview to another film i do n't care for spoofs about catholics and protestants the pythons ca n't sing or dance \( for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable \) i say to the fans of python get a life
unfortunately they just do not get off the ground python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge regrettably they missed the mark on this one one or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it
not my type of humor i think i'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining
i'm sorry folks , but i went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen it would be a tremendous understatement to say i was disappointed this film is horrible in nearly every respect , but this is the film 's fatal flaw a character study is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature
this dvd has a very bad image and sound altought it is a good movie , i do n't recomend it if you are looking for a charles bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction no menu , no subtitles , no chapter selection i wished i did not buy it
the gauntlet may rank as one of clint eastwood 's worst movies it is so unrealistic and silly i frankly did n't want to even finish it released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and dirty harry movies , it stands out as being a real stinker
what a rip off ! this is my very first bad experience with amazon heck , this is the first time i have n't been extremely satisfied
i had to contact amazon five times about this item i ordered it on 10 1 and it did n't ship for several weeks then when i check my account , the description had changed to umd for psp you will not get the dvd if you order this i eventually cancelled mine amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and does n't seem too worried about correcting this do not order
i am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one this is not the dvd version of the film however , on all the links to it , it says dvd when i received the item in the mail , amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return , and even told me that they would send the dvd version of the film nonetheless , two days later , i received the same psp version again
i was thrilled when i saw there was a new sesame street christmas dvd out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized and , as much as i enjoy being a sesame street kid \( 37 , just like the show \) , i was tiring of the same stuff over and over
i ca n't imagine why madonna , janet jackson , or michael jackson 's vma performances were not included in this dvd the most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded i do n't understand it is a travesty i hope mtv releases more of the vma performances with madonna , janet , and michael i 'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of vma performances
i have to say , this show did not turn me on at all i like twisted humor and a good puppet show
both sides of disc 5 are unplayable all others are o
starring tony perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer what can you say \? the red sox have jimmy pirsall , tony perkins and fear strikes out the yankees have lou gehrig , gary cooper and pride of the yankees
i just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a hollywood film \( the departed \) i can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie after watching this movie i turned to my wife and said , this movie would have been great if it would have stared someone anyone with an ounce of talent ! the acting is very affected and self conscious understand that 's how hong kong mega stars always act \( its a sort of us 1930 's throwback style \) i really , really despise us film remakes but martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline i would suggest watching the us version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new found intrigue ps i have not yet seen the departed , but i am assuming that it is a much better version than this however come on america , we have plenty of creative writers out there , ca n't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots
i love tng , ds9 , and i even quite like a few of the characters in enterprise but i hate voyager why \? one simple reason janeway i cant stand her she makes me want to puke she has only two personas in the entire 7 year series and she constantly alternates between them , and they are both nauseating first , vomit inducing compassion face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper two , tough chick face in which she puts on a hard chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable god she nauseates me the same thing happened with maggie thatcher the one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything unlike kirk , picard , sisko and even archer , janeway has no charisma at all yuck but shes not the only one , this has got to be the only star trek series in which no matter how hard i tried i could never develop any attachment to the characters they 're all boring only paris has any appeal and even then not much i watched the first 3 seasons hoping i would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up years later i finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years no the same old nauseating janeway , same old boring episodes , spewing over with self righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality' and this series is the most mushy , sentimental crap of all the star trek series there is barely an episode that is not cringe inducing in its emotional mushyness the only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'q2' episode and that was only because q was in it \( and they even turned that into a morality play \) , and the very end of 'renaissance man' when the doctor tells harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded targ good riddance voyager , and especially good riddance janeway
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly , this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak \( acting \) rendition of the story thankfully , it is word for word from the bible , which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation
the only other ff material i 've see is the movie and i did n't play any of the games yet so i'm not basing this review on that after watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1 2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked
if you 're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill , this is not the video for you however , if you want a training video on big wave surfing , go ahead a better video for the stoke would be the classic endless summer 2 much more of a better buy billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in odyssey about tow in surfing , training on watercrafts , and then they get to the surfing i fell asleep throughout the 2 3 of it i had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing nice documentary for discovery channel , not for the wired surf enthusiast so
i ca n't even begin to tell how bad this movie is it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along i sold this one the day after i bought it
this is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy something liberals like to impose on others
royal wedding is n't on dvd yet that 's because the owner of the film , warner bros has n't released it yet
every store should have a dvd shredder for movies that suck rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away adding darryl hannah and denise richards to an already horrible story line just to sell dvds is a disgrace trying to do 80 's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one save your time , money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video
flat lighting , cheap sets and costumes , dull dialog , wooden acting , and a goofy plot even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie zero stars should be an option for more inspired soft porn , check out the work of andrew blake \( andrewblake com \)
i have to agree with most of the other reviews this movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling i have found myself watching it over and over again i would rate the film as five stars unfortunately , i can not buy the dvd because the cheapskates at warner have only released this in butchered full screen format as such , i can only rate this dvd as two stars and certainly no stars for warner
our family has an embarassingly large collection of elmo and sesame street dvds , so i speak from experience i found this production to be way below par my 2 1 2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe 10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do play doh instead the plot if poorly contrived , the production value is low , the acting for the most part is awful , and it 's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age , my son has no interest in he did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer but i'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip better bets a celebration of me , grover or sesame street the street we live on
i just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter i was disappointed with the 4 dollars i spent on it for that it is more like a music video than a story the segments are of adults , no children singing or playing and the story line is n't much sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there was n't anything educational about this video and i am so glad i did n't buy it i really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now i'm sorry that we did even that stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy i hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were
all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well , there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies , never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why , i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end
did anyone else watch the same movie that i did \? or should i say try to watch the same movie that i did \? i am a huge classic sci fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one i was mislead i can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie in fact , i am sure that carpenter and o'bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past the unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring the 'effects' do n't exist , and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing it 's not funny it is embarassing i could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage
yes !
how sad and pathetic this concert is i loved the dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy after seeing how good the stooges reunion concert was i was hoping for more of the same wrong ! ! it becomes painfully clear from the start that johanssen in particular is phoning it in low point of the show is when they make human being one of the greatest rock n roll songs ever a sing a long give me a break ! ! ! !
this is one bad movies i am a devout horror fan , but i was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie the acting is worse than bad , it 's a joke the plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous save your money even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive there is no humor , no likable characters , not even a decent quote or one liner by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion , you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back so save yourself disappointment and keep looking , this movie is the biggest bomb , i have stumnbled across in years
i have to say i had no expectations going into this movie , i watched it with an open mind , ready for anything what i got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to wales , but also made me want to wail for hours because it was a waste of time i am just confused about the whole thing really , the plot the characters the ending i see other reviews on here about how creepy it was , and i just did n't feel that what i felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by maria bello \( who i have never thought had a face or talent for acting \) what they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane , where the dead go , and we can get the dead back if we give something living the daughter is whisked away like penelope taken to hades but with much less interesting results the mother and father , now have to take care of a displaced spirit child , her haunted freaky father , and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice ikea blanket for me are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter , goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na ve and gullible local folks \? \( who worships in an abattoir \? c'mon people \) none of these folds deserved children , much less a ghost one so when the mother realizes that she sucks , and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care i did n't really care , i was thinking the girl was much better off i was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it , what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father , because her daughter asked her too \? um , maybe what 's wrong in this family is that no one communicates ! ! ! ! ! oh , wait , they all flipping know morse code so that 's enough \? ! \? ! there are n't any genuine scares , and sheep with glowing eyes are n't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it the ending , both of them , did n't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together , it felt rushed i do n't understand hollywood 's obsession right now with creepy children , it 's an echo of the days of the bad seed and the omen but not homage , more like terrible copycats with no oomph so see this movie if you like sean bean , he is the only good thing about it , other than that see it to cheer when maria bello hurls herself off a cliff
\( 1 \) scarlett o'hara is the least likable heroine i 've ever seen she has no redeeming qualities
ignore the blurb on the vhs box , the movie is not about a couple 's hot parties with hip friends , it is about a couple 's awful parties with jerk friends now , that might not be a bad thing in fact , i think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones but the advertising is dishonest
this should have been better but angela bassett 's performance was the best , so i guess it 's worth a watch
others have already described the movie so i shall not repeat what has already said
i purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that i'm designing boy was i dissapointed !
unfortunately , i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which , of course , does n't function on a european system , despite my adress beeing in switzerland so i was kind of disapointed to have a \) lost the money b \) not been able to watch the movie one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player
i like pauley shore i have seen him in other movies that i liked so i made the mistake of buying the jury duty video because i liked in the army now and bio dome and assumed i would like this too , well i learned my lesson well and i learned it the hard way and wasted my money and i have learned to never assume i will like a movie because i liked the actor in another movie and from now on i will rent the movie first ! jury duty simply was just plain awful with it 's weak , boring plot and unfunny humor ! in the army now and bio dome were a lot funnier , and if you want to kick back , relax and laugh your backside off than watch those movies
hey genius good job ruining the end of the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it like , say , my five year old and eight year old children it's a miracle if i can even get them to sit still for five minutes , and now that they know the ending to this film , there's no way they're ever going to agree to go to bed tonight thanks a bunch ever heard of the internet before \? you must be a first time user
here we go again another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots the differences between season 3 and this drivel are staggering
first off , let me explain why i purchased the around the world in 80 days dvd in the first place , sight unseen one , i was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950 's as i could on dvd , to add to my personal library two , it was the winner of the 1956 best picture oscar \( how bad could it be , right \? \) and third , it was on sale at my local wholesaler so i figured , what the hey , i 'll take a chance
this final season is just ridiculous and not in a good way
when shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang but saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks now dont get me wrong , it was funny , i 'll give it that , that 's the only reason it got 2 stars , but season 1 4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure in living color wise so i 'd recomend this for the series collectors like me meaning i have season 1 4 and although i didnt like season 5 , i 'd feel uncomplete without it
this is a wonderful film some may say it 's a bit slow paced and perhaps it 's not geared for the mtv generation 's pace of visual stimulation nonetheless , patience has it 's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance it appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director , tati unfortunately , the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft , as though the telecine was not in focus it 's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care one only hopes that a dvd transfer of superior quality is in the pipes
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly , this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak \( acting \) rendition of the story thankfully , it is word for word from the bible , which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation
i did watch that and i did not liked cause i know good detailed information about this history this dvd is making polishing boeing company instead lockheed won this techonology war ! it is 2 hours long and boeing appears most of the times there is no good explanation how lockheed is performed that outstanding job it all talkes about boeing and at the final it again declares boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs i think the director was from boeing compan
i do n't know what to say about this it was interesting but not wowing by any standards it was semi enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too but the music sucks and thats half the dvd right there recommend renting or borrowing from a friend i would n't buy this dvd again
ok , i 'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn this film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon it really does n't take a genius to figure out this plot i mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room i turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film 's plot and sure enough i was right on the money , only i thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no , it had to keep going and going just end allready , i get it !
i am a big fan of martial arts films having lived in taiwan however , this one was over hyped in my opinion the love affairs in the dvd were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times i often enjoy the melodrama and over acting of chinese films , but i gagged a few times on this one it was down right goofy at times i really wanted this one to grab me , but it did not
while it may be true that the camera does n't lie , when you take 600 hours of footage and edit them down to 6 , you have a lot of leaway to manipulate immediately after finishing the film , i would have given this movie 4 stars it 's very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes after we finished watching it , however , we wanted to know more , so we started gathering information from other sources very quickly , we discovered that we had been conned jean xavier de lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story , and he crafted the footage to tell that story unfortunately , it does n't appear to be the real story we felt so betrayed we 'd spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown \( much less explained \) and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation if you want to see a well made film that will keep you amazed and guessing , definitely see this film if you want to see something that reflects reality , i would look elsewhere
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
