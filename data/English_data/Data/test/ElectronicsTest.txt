this was a defective unit got new unit and it works as expected
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord if you do n't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all
pluged it in and good to go , i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen , a little overwhelmed with all the features , it could be more stremlined , for a novice user they would be entirely lost , perhaps that is whats on the install disk \( easier setup \) , but my experience self , got through just fine , enabled the maximum security features \( more so then the easy setup button , which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments \)
i'm glad that i bought the carry case with my garmin etrex , because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry i have n't used the belt clip yet , but i liked that option
after reading the online reviews of this product vs the portable product i went with this one portability is not much of a need , i plan on being around a power outlet the sound is in line with a radio boom box of the same size and it 's about the same weight i have a lot of trees around my house so i have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit i have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and i can hear it all over the first floor of my home so far i'm happy that i bought it
i was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system i purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased you can hear the music in several other rooms if the volume is turned up , without distortion
this case is a veritable dirt magnet it attracts more lint than i ever knew existed on my desk however , it protects very well one thing i was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen however , it does n't even touch the ipod also i worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel while it is n't quite as sensitive , it makes it more precise in my opinion , seeing as how i all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when i wanted in the s range without the case on this blue case even looks good on my black ipod , even though i was worried the color would appear muted it 's still vibrant
printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is , cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i'm fine with that
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago one handset gave us problems from the start , but was promptly replaced when returned for service the system works fine in our 2 story , 2 , 300 sq ft home i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street i like the features , including paging system , call transfer , and handset speakerphone being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus i think the sound quality is very good , and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag
i bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it ! it has great sound quality i love the features it has such as speakerphone , caller id , and it 's phone directory the only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice into both directories oher than that , this is a great phone i have owned panasonic and ge cordless phones in the past and had problems i even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late
this fm transmitter is the bomb diggiti ! !
on the plus side , it 's a great value for the games that do work on the t5 simcity alone is probably worth the price
hp premium plus photo paper is the only way to go if you desire tremendous photos from your home printer without any scratching , scuffing or blemishes i have tried less expensive paper from hp as well as other manufacturers the difference in quality is obvious if you want friends and family to think you know what you are doing , share photo 's on hp premium plus glossy paper
excelent , hard drive , good price and good time for seller
i ordered one from an amazon partner for 01 plus shipping , then with my a9 discount the price was even lower so i got one for less than the shipping cost true , the seller made a little on the shipping maybe 4 50 not counting time think how much apple must be making ! the packaging did n't mention nano so with a bit of trepidation i plugged it into the wall and my ipod and my nano liked it ! charging happened it must have been made before the nano came out as other reviewers have said , buy this one and avoid a high price elsewhere
i purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go the case holds the gps , mount and all the different cables the foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or without the velcro staps hold the mount the ac cord this way when you are looking for it , everthing is in one place the case is made well and very plain looking on the outside , so not to draw any attention
very easy to set up , great product picture is great on my samsung 50 inch plasma
it is a pleasure to use this dvd player the quality of the image is superb it upgrades definition on dvds and the difference is very \( favorably \) noticed as compared to that obtaibed from a less than a year old sony player \( with hdmi \) , the difference in image quality absolutely huge
i had a problem with my sunrocket voip and i read that someone had bought this modem and that it solved her problem i gave it a shot and guess what no more dropped calls thank you motorola ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally , the dvi d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a dvi d cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few \( very few \) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of hdmi , nobody really makes them anymore
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand
i am not really a big tech person so i do n't have the mega system hooked up to my computer and dvd tv but i do know that since i got this i have been blasting my music like crazy i do n't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because i have enough space down there and all i have to is lean down anyway i personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud \( considering its computer speakers \) i do n't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when i'm in the shower so i am pretty much happy with them
these speakers are amazing , i am truly shocked to receive something so sweet at an unbelievable price , amazon thank you for the hook up , my speaker system rocks my delivery experience with amazon was great ca n't thank you enough , keep up the great service , truly
i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers , but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks , creatures , or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop , i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max \( yes i underestimated these speakers \) when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume , and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk !
the camera is perfect if using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you the picture is clear not to grainy the only heads up is lighting try to use the camera in a well light area we are stationed in japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home the camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick the best part is the price wo n't break the bank
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon 's free shipping option , but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma mp780 \( that i also bought from amazon \) most of my printing is borderless 8 1 2x11 and the quality is always great definitely worth it if turnaround time is a problem , buy two so you always have a spare
gave as a gift excellent value tune capacity more than sufficient , easy to use and sound quality is right up there must get one for myself
outstanding product as you would expect from panasonic incoming calls loud and clear the scroll telephone directory is convenient and easy to use i do not like the beep sound when the hand set is placed back in the cradle \( it cannot be turned off
i often have problems with memorex brand but have never had a problem with verbati
i do n't think i would have used my i5 without this i just wish it came with the gps instead of having to buy it separately great to easily move my gps from car to car highly recommend
a great solution to theft prevention for this gps the legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box
the reader is fast example i took 56 2mp images from my camera recently i plugged this reader into my g4 , plugged in the card , the card mounted , i dragged the images to my pictures folder , and they copied immediately no waiting i was amazed , because with my mia usb reader , it could take a while to transfer that many images , over a minute a copy dialog did n't even pop up , because it transferred so fast it does n't hurt that it 's a cutie too 5 stars
it 's a canon product made for another canon product how can you go wrong \?
good printer ink , always try to use factory ink and these are with a good price i bought all the colors and paper at the same time all good price and free shipping save gas driving to local stores
operation of the sony dvpnss550 b single disc dvd player has been straight forward picture quality is very good , and the desired basic features have functioned without problems in other words , in the 2 1 2 months since we have owned this player , quality and reliability have been high price too was very reasonable that means durability is the last quality to consider , which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years but we wo n't know that for years
these mini cd rs work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only 42 cents apiece
this is a great multi function printer scanner copier fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload
as long as i own a pair of these headphones , i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again they sound perfect i cannot fathom a more balanced , natural sound these babies put you in the recording studio , or in the concert hall ! bass is crisp , taut , and strong you can feel it yet it is not overbearing or boomy midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist , and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes the folding feature is handy
good sound for the price , and very durable discrete design i prefer the plug design to other headphones they do n't fall out , and i can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane , it makes almost no difference just be careful in the traffic \)
these earphones are excellent quality noise that gets in from outside is so low that i can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me in addition , the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones
i just got my nano last week and the minute i turned it on \( before even transfering any music to it \) i could hear a faint noise buzz from the nano it comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as i turn off the unit has anyone experienced this with theirs \? my first generation nano does not experience this noise i plan to take it to an apple store and try to get a replacement
i have never been a fan of the ipod i have been an iriver h120 , h320 , and h340 owner i had a toshiba gigabeat and currently own an archos av500 the reason for owning a nano is because of the size of the av500 it is too big to pack around unless i am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on the nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote , \( soon \) , i am very happy with it it loads from itunes very easily and i have had no problems with it not playing certain files , \( and i would reencode them if there was a problem \) apple , do n't let me down
the koss pro 4aa 's were not made for ipod mp3 headphone users to begin with , they reveal the low fidelity of mp3 files \( compared with lp 's or cd 's \) also , they require a 1 4 to 3 5mm \( or other \) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment
bought this mouse over 3 months ago , and its still going strong the batteries last forever \( i 've never replaced them yet \) my only problem is that at times , i will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom , but it wo n't seem to turn off ! i reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again , and this always does the trick other than that , very ergonomic , extremely smooth and precise
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop the usb just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse , i ca n't
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well
my first purchase of the q9b resulted in a return as the display was n't mounted properly within the plastic housing this resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1 4 and made the viewing unpleasant the screen also was n't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100 having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it suffice to say , quality control missed this one
you idiot , its not only for psps the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot phones cameras psp tvs computers
after ordering non oem inks from several different places on the web \( and having some problems with them \) , i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices
hp did n't make 13x19 paper when i bought my 13x19 hp printer way to go , hp they may make it now , but i never check , b c i'm totally satisifed w this paper runs smooth and looks great
product was as described reception was strong and weak depending on your location was able to receive all frequencies rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy could get annoying on a very windy day radio is bulky and heavy
i have used gps units from cobra , garmin , and lowrance i consider this cobra unit to be one of the best i started with the cobra but it was stolen after a month then i bought the lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the cobra i returned the lowrance and bought the garmin 340
the unit operates as good as any other gps system available , plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches i am very impressed with the gps , but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed the unit falls off the window and from the dash , plus the power cord comes out too easily the unit deserves a five star rating , but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 , 2005 businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article
if money was no object , i would prefer the totally wireless headset phone , however , this has been a great alternative i have tmj , and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck , while holding my toddler , while preparing dinner , compound my pain go figure ! i find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain , but , the product works great i have had no problems hearing anyone , nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me the earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off , even for someone with elfishly small ears like me !
i 've owned this headphone for about a year now , and i 've got to say , after going through multiple headphones , this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke \( i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon \) , i 'll surely buy another one again !
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer i have w2k at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2 never had any type of compatibility issue this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon
i am very pleased with the quality of the product i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters after the rebate , the price was very competitive
hey , do n't listen to those other schmucks so maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable , but the rest just complain too much i love this thing ! i got it for christmas , and now for 20 , you ca n't beat that i use a standard charger for it in my car , so i never have to worry about batteries it seems that the best way to get it to sound the best , is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using \( equalizer \) i have also used it on my portable dvd player in the car and it sounds awesome ! for the price , i highly recommend this product
i 've used the keyboard mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish of course , any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard mouse setup , but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish
i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish \( odd , i know \) , i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively inexpensive this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch , in quality , my larger studio size headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone , rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case , means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games 5 stars
after buying my ipod , i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock , which is about 300 , your better off only spending about 25 and getting just as good quality
i was unsure at first if this product would work with my ipod nano , but after checking out griffin 's website , i decided to go ahead and order it it works great ! i like to play solitaire and read text files on my nano , so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if i did n't use the screen so much tunejuice means i do n't ever have to worry about that again i just keep a couple of 9v batteries with me , and i can keep listening , playing , reading or whatever on my nano as long as i want love it
i have been using my sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures i have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i did n't want to spend the money on this either , but it is better i really do n't know why , but it is no question about it perfect picture and sound ! i have a yamaha rx v2700 receiver which has hdmi hookups i tried a hdmi cable that came with my directv box \( from my toshiba hd dvd player \) and it was seriously lacking this hookup is much better ! i have a monster cable hdmi hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my sony 46 flat panel as well \( more but \) i'm finally satisfied i'm watching \( and listening to \) batman begins \( in true hd sound \) on hd dvd and it is superb ! ! ! ! this is just awesome ! the stuff of fantasy you only have to buy this these cables once , so why not buy the best \? ! i highly recommend this move
this remote will do everything you need or want simple to use and great customer service i had a couple of glitches \( buttons that did n't work quite right \) when i first programmed the device , but the harmony support team helped me through those areas the changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the harmony web site so if i ever need to , all i have to do is reload the info
i paid about a dollar for this holder holds and protects the ipaq nicely can hold some credit cards as well as id overall a decent product for a low price
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop it 's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks i have been pleased with apc products for about six years they provide excellent customer support i highly recommend their products
it also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time i 've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle \( out of two that come with it \) still looks almost full if the price was a little more consumer friendly i 'd give it five stars i mean come on when you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50 pack of cd r 's for less than 14 , the profit margin on something like this is probably 200 or more
i found this keyboard to be very helpful i am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers while my laptop can be used to type , when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable this keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing the bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if i would like without stopping the connection i would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it overall , a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier
i had it now for 12 months and no problems with it its tiny lightweight and great speed my old computer has to work quite hard to recognize it , but my laptop has no problems
have been using them for a week now
excellent sound , much much much better that the one that comes with any players , zens or ipod
i just recently move from dial up to dsl going dsl was not enough i did not want to have cables running though the house so i started looking into going wireless to make a long story short , after a little investigation i decided to make the leap into wireless technology i purchased the wap55ag router and the adapter cards , wmp55ag and wpc55ag
i am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone it looks good , but more importantly , it feels good button placement , weight , smoothness , everything was done well coming from wired mice , the lack of a wire is very freeing i am also especially happy with how small the usb radio receiver is i am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is
received this speaker as a replacement for the advent aw 810 which did not work at all this one was much easier to install and calibrate ! very happy with range and sound quality highly recommended
these are very comfortable to wear , and the sound is great i use them out jogging , and they stay put , without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise , so be careful around traffic , as you cannot hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone
i bought these ear headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club the sound quality is acceptable , not exceptional the construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right that places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out i have no idea why sony thought that this was a good design for the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord i would give these a b good not great
the logitech cordless trackman wheel was purchased in sept 2006 i have had this for two months at the time this review is being written
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer it works just as well as the corded one when i'm in my office for travel , the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel it 's not a small , usb stick that goes in the back it 's a long , corded , mouse looking device that sends recieves the signal to the trackman i do n't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel all that said , i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
my canon 510 got glowing reviews just about across the board , but not this printer i have very little space , and needed something small just for photos so , even though there were many negative reviews i went ahead and bought it could n't be happier ! colour fabulous ! and when you print on stock paper you can use photo to do some extra artwork on i love it
product nicely made , looks like quality product and performs fine
my wife and i used the fr300 during the week long queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered one 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume the cell phone charger is cool , but it takes a lot of winding the light is good in a pinch , but not particularly useful
this map set met all my expectations , and was far more current than i had expected software for turn by turn directions on roadways while driving works great with the garmin ctrex gps recommended to load many states you will need large memory card , 1 gb
if you buy this service plan , print out the contract and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan , but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it
easy enough to pop off the normal ant \( roadmate 700 \) and pop on this magmount version and what a difference it made ! signals really are remarkedly improved highly suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you 'll get the birds
a lot cheaper than model specific docking stations , and 'does what it says on the tin' quite stylish too , as docking stations go
we used the gtx600vp4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling the 5 watt power gave us ample range does it reach 18 or 20 miles , do n't know but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains it 's a great way to stay in touch when traveling the batteries are rechargeable , both a c d c the ear pieces were very good for privacy very easy to use and well worth the price a good investment
i was hesitant to get this , since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception now that i bought it , i'm very glad i have it it does all the things you might want in a disaster , inluding a flashlight , red flashing light \( especially if your car breaks down at night \) , a siren \( if you 're trapped in a building \) , ac , battery , and crank power , and multiple radio bands while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations , in a disaster , you only need a few stations , as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news between the am , fm , tv , and noaa bands , my radio will received a huge number of stations many more than would ever be needed in a disaster \( i did n't try the cellphone charging function \) it comes in a carrying case
i just recieved my hdmi cable and am very impressed the price is just what it should be about 5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over 100 for this cable at a store the service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days ! i highly recommend this cable i just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the tv and wow what a great picture all around the color is just so much more vivid using hdmi compared to component 3 wire connectors get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others
this is the perfect keyboard \( i know cuz i am typing on it right now \) i recommend if you like media boards
sandisk has done it again they never seem to let me down with their products i was in the market for another memory chip since i kept filling up my smaller 128 mb chip the price was the deciding factor for me , as being a college student the financial situation was tight but this product was perfect , right price , excellecnt storage space , good name get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
fast shipping , very happy with the garmin their tech support is good they answer all questions will buy from amazon again will buy a garmin agai
this is great ! my only problem is the knob for adjusting it 's to loose
i bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a 9 99 mouse , and i 'll never turn back this mouse is outstanding for gaming it 's pretty damned accurate , and it easily fits in my hand good price , too
i you own a smartphone , you 'll need one of these also happy this came with an adapter card , to plug in the microsd into it to move data from my mac to the phone
the sandisk 1gb micro sd card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging i installed it in my motorala razr v3m as expanded memory for my music library be sure to remove the razr battery to clear the access slot for the micro sd the v3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems i used motorola phone tools to transfer my entire music library the program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer the entire music library a full 1gb transferred reasonably quickly the v3m is slow to access my music using menu function 3 under get tunes tones function 6 manage music accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well the new corded motorola syn1301b stereo earbuds work well in this configuration sound quality is surprisingly good , but the large diameter earbuds are flat not tapered and do not seat very well in the ear canal the sandisk 1gb microsd card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the v3m as cell phone with mp3 player
i upgraded from some speakers i purchased when i built my system the sound difference was wonderful it is a clean crisp fresh sound worth every penny
pros
okay so it was about 8 45 at night i was coming on to a 1 2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live i was doing 60mph , the speed limit is 40 as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small k band warning i instantly slow down to the speed limit as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph then it gets to full k band i look to my left where there is a service parking area , and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car as i pass the police car , i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead
this is my second escort passport 8500 x50 the first one is in another car it saved me many times for getting caught though i'm not maniac driver the detection range is very good , it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car i love the blue color and it only costs 30 more than red the only problem that i have experienced on my first one is sometimes i got laser false warning signals , especially on raining day with defog is on i heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes x50 pop and laser false warning signals , and my first x50 is in my turbo charged car i'm not sure if pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much , i have it turned off overall , it 's very good detector , you will get payback if you own one
the best headphones i ever had , good fit excellent sound on my soundblaster x fi ! !
i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below \( followed exactly \) there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase , i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 , this is what worked for me at any rate
works with ipod skin , no need to take off cover looks good has connections for audio , tv cables and remote are additional included are 5 adapters for all ipods that have doc connector
this is a great storage device i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse i love the lanyard , that helps me to keep track of the drive worth every i paid for it !
this is a very nice set of paper and envelopes the price is really great the paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double the colors come out very bright and the folding is easy overall it is a good deal
i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my 2 4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone , i can contact her to talk to her
i am extremely pleased with the purchase i am using it in my office simple plug and play \( no brainer \) ! !
like most other reviews , i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit movies are amazing ! my music collection never sounded so good if you want to get away from it all for awhile , slip these babies in your ears and chill
i bought usb rudder pedals and yoke for use with x plane on a mac dual g5
i needed a simple solution for my office i wanted to be able to use the phone , but not get tied down by the handset , or the headset here was my solution , since the ts105b has the 2 5mm port for a headset , i purchased a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office so far wow ! ! ! its worked out great the phone is also good by itself , plus it was inexpensive through amazon for anyone interested in going the route i took you will not be disappointed
i have had this tv since mid march 2006 i absolutley love it ! ! i did extensive research before i bought a large screen tv and found that this samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck i read some reviews saying that dlp technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect , especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action one reviewer specifically said to try playing bourne supremecy to see an example of the rainbow effect this was the first dvd i played on this tv and i did not once have a problem with rainbow effect overall i have no complaints with this tv samsung has produced an excellent product i recommend either satellite or hd programming for the best picture regular cable comes in sort of grainy
there is a little story before this
this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag , and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset , ie turn off the headset , receiver and ipod all from the headset instead , i have to get the ipod back out , turn it off , turn the receiver off , then turn the headset off
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon , and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair \( took about 10 minutes to do , let it cure overnight \) headphones look ok , with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards \( reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses \) sound is very good \( better than most earbuds \) , they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever , and range is outstanding my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on , and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco , and they are only partially functional with the nano \( ca n't use the advance track feature of the headphones \)
i am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from case logic this is a great product and is manufactured well holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out i do n't transport them so i ca n't comment on that like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up get this if you need a lot of storage
this headphone extension is perfect ! it is not as long as described \( about 15 feet \) but that 's o k with me the connections are tight \( the plugs do n't pull apart \) it maintains sonic quality it also retains it 's elasticity using this extension cord my grado sr 60 's sound better than any wireless phones you wo n't be dissapointed !
this is a pretty decent cheapo case if you want something that you 'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs , then you may want to get something a little sturdier for my archival purposes , however , it works just fine
purchase service
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
this was by far the easiest computer peripheral i have ever setup ! works flawlessly with my netgear wireless router
it is remarkable that , even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence , none of them are near perfect i tried four different cases , both hard plastic and silicone variants , and the iskin case comes the closest , protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days love the service at amazon
these are the best period ! look no further because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes after 3 conversations with canon customer care , we decided it was not the printer , but the cheaper ink i switched back to canon , bit the bullet on the price , and everything is fine i found decent prices on amazon , particularly at eek industries
this is a nifty very small musical device that i use when exercising its great holds all the songs i can listen to and is so portable i really like i
i was so happy with my creative zen nano that i bought one as a gift i love the color choice and the sound is great love the pause button it came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band you do not need to buy one ! ! amazon delivered it in 2 days
this printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrived
this is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality
i'm using monster optical cable as well , but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf
sound quality is very good , and i have n't run out of battery so far the base is somewhat smaller than what i expected from the pictures the handsets are well designed on my previous phone it happened that the mute function became engaged when i kept the phone between my head and my shoulders this did not happen with these so far speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages answering machine works well easy to copy phonebook entries between phones
this does exactly what it is supposed to do it is light , easy to pack , easy to use , and probably difficult to crack
i tried both microsoft 's lifecam vx 3000 and vx 6000 had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core 3 00ghz cpu with 2 gigs of ram and , with both of those , the video lagged the audio \( distractingly so \) spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening \( got through on their toll free line \) and he pointed me to new software for the vx 6000 downloaded the 50 meg plus file , installed it , but the vx 6000 still produced out of sync video vs audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker
easy to operate and good focus just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
garmin ique m5
we bought this about a month ago from amazon the product itself seems fine we used it on a vacation drive from nj to myrtle beach and back at times , it was a help \( like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in va and we needed an alternate route \) however , you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it does n't always recommend the best or shortest route also , it was missing certain stores , restaurants , etc that had been around for awhile
this phone was an additional phone for the model ip811 2 phone system used for vonage this system has every feature that i could want , including range and quality , there are no negatives i am highly recommending this phone and system
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture you would n't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing i have shown it to an i pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the i pod
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap 76s to my hp laptop so far it has performed perfectly i have not tried to use it for other applications yet , so i ca n't comment on how well it would work in other situations
i find this printer to be better than hp or epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles , just a solid printer that performs as i anticipated
the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice , i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me
i bought four of these so far they appear to work well they do not work with compact flourescent lights well , but are fine with incandescent bulbs
i bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17 hyundai l90d \( which is a great low priced screen for gaming \) , which was the replacement for a dell fp2100 \( that i gave to my wife \) anyways , this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times \( more than enough for my flight sims \) movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution has n't been a problem the design is probably the neatest looking out there \( subjective i realize \) the only gripe i have w this monitor is lack of swivel \( sigh \) other than that i'm very pleased with everything about this screen
wow just got one of these at a great price , hooked it up to my mac g4 via a dvid cable , and it boots up at native resolution \( 1680 x 1050 \) automatically no muss , no fuss text is crisp and clean
my favorite thing about this phone is that the caller id captures 11 digit numbers \( 1 xxx xxx xxxx \) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call my old phone only captured 10 digits \( xxx xxx xxxx \) which meant i had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first this new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number i put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in very handy as far as being a phone , it does everything well and after a couple of months i am still as happy as could be with it
this is the rockinest think i 've ever seen or buyed dudes ! ! ! check it ou
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking , hiking , kayaking , and in the car to i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
ok here 's the deal i 've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years i love my magellan i 've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface \( the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me \) and how the menu structure was built
i had been talking about wanting an mp3 player , but i did not want an ipod , as i heard you cannot add files in windows format and that 's what all of my music is i received this e260 4 gb mp3 player for my birthday in june 2006 , and this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned although there are a few little quirks , overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this mp3 player
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i 've never written a review , but i 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other amazon buyers , so i felt a really good product like the anycom bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review
i was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer the photo output is awesome and it 's very fast !
i'm a skeptic no , i mean i'm really a skeptic especially in today 's marketplace \( because nothing is built like it used to be \) i do n't buy anything without checking it out first , and even then , i expect that it 's probably going to fail me when i do yeah , wonderful view there , huh \?
the sound of these earbuds are great and they are a value for the price
using this kingston chip on my pearl 8100 phone and it has worked flawlessly
i work in a computer lab where we constantly re image devices \( using norton ghost \) i have 3 laptops and 1 dell gx620 desktop and all of them have gigabit connection when i connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous , i get the same performance \( 0 differences \) as i run 1 laptop to the gx620 this testing was done with cat5 cables that i pick randomly from my lab i ca n't wait to add more devices and using cat6 cables to get my work done faster
the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car however , the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs the 9 feet using the gps 's internal antenna when in an open area garmin 's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around \( on my gps \) i feel the antenna was worth purchasing
i use the suctions mount antenna because i remove from sight whenever i leave my car which is idea for my purposes the antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock the only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up
this unit has a v in my thought was that one could play video games on it , or view images from a camcorder digital camera however , all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen so it does not allow me to do all i wanted it is also a bit on the loud side if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit i got one of those also , and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor it also does not make much noise
this is a great swicth with low price i use it together with d link di 704 4 port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 pc , two servers , one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp connecting via the swicth for internet sharing does n't show any noticeable slow response as compared to connecting via the router directly it works well by itself as we as with d link di 704
i would highly recommend this phone set easy to program and crystal clear reception a definite 5 star
works well with canon 10d , 30d , and s40 fairly fast write speed and 4gb pretty big \( 1600 jpgs in the 30d ! \)
for the epson photo 1270 , the photo quality and color are excellent i have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer
this product was very easy to set up hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time been running 3 months with no problems what so ever would highly recommend
i am amazed by the quality of the guitar the product is extremely good the service by amazon was ultimate thanks a lot amazon
since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas , i recommend you get this one depending on type of your ipaq \( 1900 series vs 3000 series \) , you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case once you 're done , however , it 's very easy to use and carry it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket , unlike so many other cases the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface , this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection \( klutzes be warned \) the leather feels surprisingly good , almost a lambskin kind of quality the credit card space is not very useful , but you can shove a couple of business cards in there a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
this is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers you do n't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming ! excellent travel accessory
works exactly as advertised i travel a lot and i can finally enjoy those long travel hours in planes calmly
unit 's range shorter than expected , but i feel that i got what i wanted , and paid for shipping and delivery were great
i was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both ! ! it 's very easy to learn and enter stuff i'm a first time pda owner and this is an excellent product !
if you originally newly unlocked a new locked mapsource cd rom dvd rom product on or after the release date of an update for that same product , you are eligible to unlock on that specific update what you unlocked on the original for no charge in other words , you can update to the latest data for free ! visit the garmin web site for more inf
if you 're looking for isolation from ambient noise , these are great i use them as in ear monitors for my onstage use \( rock band \) , and if i use the foam inserts , i can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off
i found this on clearance at another retailer \( i guess not everyone likes pink \) , and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for skinny armed people , but not so ! i 've got plenty of room , it fits great , and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way , though makes mowing the lawn way more fun
the phone works great ! i have three of these and a base the best phones i have had the other phones i have are the tcx800 model \( previous version \) , equally good
i just use the keyboard like a business user i do n't use the media stuff i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works i like that it 's not huge and does n't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use the rechargeable mouse is handy as well prior to this , i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row , and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me i do n't know if it 's because it 's logitech or it 's bluetooth , but the keyboard mouse are as responsive as were they wired \( after they wake up \)
i used the tripp lite to charge my powerbook and digital camera during a cross country trip to grad school it worked great and i had no problems the only thing i could have used was a second outlet
esactly what i was wanting when you turn there is resistance \( springs i think \) and everything works great if you use flight sims you need this product works awsome
nicely designed leather case w belt clip i bought this for my hp hx2415 pockets good for sd memory cards belt clip hooks very tightly to belt , so you do n't have to worry about dropping pda
este estuche lo compr para mi ipaq hx2415 y es muy c modo de llevar porque no es grande y adem s el equipo se mantiene seguro por el dise o que tiene
this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need as a chronically disorganized person , the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings the strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic , so shocks are well absorbed
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
great sound quality great signal quality i can hear everyone well , and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well the main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger , with a couple walls in between , and i have no problems with signal
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you do n't have big hands it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely , even if you are left handed the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who do n't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward , backward , and switch between programs the button in the middle though \( the one that lets you switch programs \) is out of the way it takes just a bit more effort to use , meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button i actually hardly ever use that button i ca n't live without the forward backward buttons though i find myself man handling other mice thinking they too have those neat , little buttons the mouse has a really good response to movement as well i 've used it for gaming as well , though i admit i'm not a hardcore gamer i really recommend this mouse i ca n't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
pros
i love it you can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
this is an excellent product if you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you i am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day i have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places the garmin gps 18 plugs right into the usb port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments i 'll admit nroute took a little getting used to \( for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you 're not going to find it \) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie instead of spelling hoover street you just type hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations a great buy for only 100 bucks ! if you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of gps , dont spend 500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome gps sensor for only 100
obviously , there are far better printers on the market but if you 're looking for a quality 3 in one in the 100 to 150 range , this one seems to be at the top of the pack
since i 've seen musicians use jbl speakers for their concerts , that gave me a trust in their product with that , i became an owner to a desktop jbl pc cpeaker this product has been satisfactory and by far i have no complaints from it
note this is a review of the targus pa225u retractable phone ethernet cord \( plastic casing \) it 's the rectangular model , not the oval shaped one
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well
i just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup i had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck however , with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear it is so small and just excellent great work , logitech
i have the canon mp500 printer and canon rebel xt camera both capable of producing amazing results , but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers if you are looking to print out very impressive photos , then i would recommend getting the 8x10 photo plus glossy definitely nice enough to frame and with plus glossy , you 're definitely saving instead of paying to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my mp500 and printed using plus glossy , and the print is significantly better than the original
i tested my new canon i960 with a variety of papers like most printers , the output is much better when using the manufacture 's own paper \( as opposed to the cheaper generic paper \) , but there is no need to buy the most expensive pro paper as neither i nor my wife could discern any difference between the two there may be a benifit to the pro paper that cannot be seen \( lasts longer \? \) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your canon printer \( i think they look better than the ones i get from the photo lab \)
i 've had this for at least 8 months now we 've used it with xd , sd , memory stick pro , pro duo \( with the adapter \) and a few misc cards that friends' cameras may be using
this reciever is great ! it even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building i have played with many gps units and have yet to see a reciever do that this is a definte buy it is extremely accurate also i highly recomend it
the gps works in both my dell axim x5 and in my hp compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card i have used it with ms streets and trips and arcpad
i 've had my hp5510 for 4 weeks so far everything works to my expectations except when i press the scan button an error comes up on the led unable to scan documents from printer to pc no scan options you need to install or run hp software for
this printer was fine until i changed cartridges and a contact was dirty now it wo n't quit printing alignment pages all the time i have about a million now , and its cost me a fortune in ink every 3 or 4 print jobs and i get another one
ok this is the 2nd ipod mini transmitter i have purchased that has broken within a month all of a sudden it just stops working , for no apparent reason do n't waste your money it 's a piece of junk
i bought this so i could listen to my ipod in my car in the city the first couple of times , it worked great , but after that , something happened it just would n't work all i heard was static , no matter what frequency i tried this on i have yet to take a road trip with it , so maybe that will work better , but right now , i am not happy with the product maybe the fact that i live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it , but it used to work on some frequencies , and now it just does n't anymore i am very disappointed
this would be a great phone if it worked all the time i had to return the phone within 1 day because the handset was defective amazon was very helpful and prompt with a response however the handset would periodically quit working and required that the batteries be removed and reinserted to make it operational after 2 months the handset died completely at t will replace the handset under warranty , but it could take up to 3 weeks to get the replacement
i bought this to use in hotels this thing sucks i barely got it to work in my house too slow to set up based on the size of this thing , just bring a longer eithernet cord i am really disapointed
be aware , the belkin f8z063 blk tunebase fm for ipod nano is not compatible with the 2nd generation nano i am returning mine to amazon , and buy a compatible one from the apple store
i have several friends that have had similar items in the last few years that have worked nicely i'm sure this is a great product having said that this product is not and i repeat is not compatable with the new ipod nanos the new ipod nanos are slightly wider than the original and will not connect to this product i really hope amazon puts up a warning soon and i will do my best to try to get that done again this does not work with the 4gb and i assume the 8gb nano as well so do not buy it unless you have the older model nano
i live in the atlanta area and was never able to get a good sound quality coming from the belkin fm transmitter it seemed like i was listening to a fm station that was not coming in good
i had this in my computer for a month , with a satellite radio on the audio in and speakers on the line out it started crackling and the audio was distorted after a few weeks i took the sb out and went back to the motherboard onboard audio and it worked fine
i purchased the coby ca 739 wireless fm transmitter and was horrified by how each of its pre programmed frequencies were major denver area radio stations or had high amounts of static the transmitter was noisy and weak i sent it back and took a restocking fee hit plus i had to pay for the return postage
i originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale , but i did n't install it until the beginning of july for our cross country trip from oregon to wash dc during the trip , there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the pacific northwest i kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city once i got out of the nw , i had no problems picking up a signal unless i was in a long tunnel or deep valley
i bought this card more then a year ago overall i'm not impressed , and would n't buy it again first of all , in 30 of cases it crashes my tungsten e secondly , the games are not that much fun simcity is extremely limited and not enjoyable to play at all honestly , i have more fun playing games i 've downloaded for free final annoyance the card is slimmer then a regular sd so it slides off easily from the slots of the hardcase making it easy to lose
i was hoping to buy a small handheld vacuum for my office and computer hardware \( keyboads , air inlets , and what have you \) however , the datavac has so little power , even after a full charge , that it 's next to useless i ca n't recommend it
the charger is very convenient power related to ad dc is extremely useful high tech design and features sucking and blowing power does not measure up to the price it has an extremely disappointing performance it feels like a child toy rather than a useful tool for a personal computer or laptop will not recommend anyone to purchase this item due to the lack of performance
these headphones are terrible , the sound is not good , and they hiss not worth the money i have real cheap ones that sound alot better
broken after 3 uses extremely flimsy spend a few more buck and buy something more substantial
i am not using this microphone , the cord from the back of my computer barely reaches uncomfortable to lean so far forward
the matte photo paper that i received was really poor quality no matter what setting my printer was set to , the ink ran together and created a really low quality photo i do not recomend this item
when it works , it works very well but one day it suddenly died on me i had a comcast technician come and test my modem and after using some complicated equipments to test it , he concluded that the modem is dead after he gave me another modem , my network is up again very bad reliability motorola should be more responsible for their quality control !
this receiver does n't work in rural areas it does n't work as well as a cheap battery powered fm radio
a 10 cable does the same thing do not believe the hype monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it its digital , 1s and 0s either it reads it or it doesnt
have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you an arm and a leg \? these cables cost that , your first son , and bidding rights to your estate do n't get me wrong monster makes great cables let there be no confusion on this point but they 're just incredibly expensive , and this is made much worse with these cables
ok it functions well as a clock radio just fine reliable but that 's not too much to expect yes , it will charge your ipod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually \( though not gradual enough \) gets louder the adaptor for my nano fit fine and i did n't find the clock too bright \( it has 3 settings \) but the sound is really terrible it sounds like its coming from a transistor radio
may be i got a defective one
i had several problems with the ipod , mostly because of its horrible software itunes it messed up the firmware on the device several times , it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes
i just purchased the hp dvd740e from costco , and burned the cdr disc came with drive the lightscribe worked really well , it was the first experience , so i came here for reviews on dvdr , i was told that the verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the hp 's , so i purchased the verbatim 30pk , received today i was so excited , that i immediately burn two discs with the best setting , but both come out fuzzy and presented the out of focus dull feel , look terrible with no detail compared to the hp bonus disc is this a joke \? this is my first amazon review , ca n't help to vent my disappointment thanks for the super fast shipping anyway
i have purchased 10 of these drives , all at once what a mistake they are very flakey and will 'disappear' while copying data to them by usb you have to turn the drive off and back on for windows to find it again i do not have this problem with any other usb drive only lacie drives you cannot use one as a backup for this very reason , copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks
this drive suffers from repeated delayed write file errors ultimately it means you will lose all the data on it
as of right now , i am an apple student developer
i had a previous good experience with a jabra headset this one was recommended for my panasonic cordless phone by jabra however , the sound quality is terrible it lacks any kind of high frequency response , and so sounds very boomy and full of bass , making it almost impossible to use it also needs a foam cover , since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy i contacted jabra about this product , but received no response maybe it would work better with a different phone , but definitely not with my panasonic
i was using it as a backup device and it failed after about 12 months so i am ripping it apart and putting in a new ultraata disk in just hope the box is not frying the disk
consumer beware ! ! ! !
do not buy this item , it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase and i bought 2 of them , so statistically it 's not jsut me the first time the door broke , and without the door there 's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection the second time , the usb part broke off and got stuck in my computer and i could not put it back together all in all , not the best product out there try instead the belkin usb to ethernet adaptor
don't buy this product there , simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly , apple support told me sorry , tough luck i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong !
please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled befsr41 v4 intermittent drop of connection which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support , i 'd post a url but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon
i like the phone 's simplicity and ergonomics it 's fatal flaw is the lack of range my office is about 50ft away from the base , and i get unacceptable interference both plain old at t ge 900 handle this distance without any problems
i 've been 'trying' to use this phone for the past 8 months worked fine in the beginning , now i ca n't even answer my calls i hit the talk button , but the phone continues to ring spend a little more money but buy a better phone this phone is a total waste of money
no tricks , just treats and delivered on time as promised
i do n't know if i just got a bad pair of radios , but they did n't work at all if we were beyond shouting distance the radios did not receive any signal at all even at very close range there was too much static to understand anything i 'll post a review of the sx700s after we get a chance to try them out
from cellphone and also the pager era i began my love affair with motorola do n't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great ! do n't buy these ! they fall into the former category
i purchased a biopod in march of 2006 received brand new unit that included omnipass software version 2 09 this software version released in 2004
i bought 1 40 pack of these disks so that i could create a set of windows 95 setup disks they worked to install windows once and then they all started dying i went to run windows setup and got halfway through and got a cannot read from device error after that i ran scandisk on all of them and only 1 disk didnt have bad sectors a few of the disks had bad sectors in the system area rendering them unformattable i advise anybody who reads this to steer clear of these cute little disks unless you want to use them as christmas ornaments
be creative ! ! mostly what you 're paying for is the embroidered 'magellan' name i like the crown royal idea of pouch or you can sew or obtain a fleece and make a square with pockets and tuck everything in there , works fine since the reviews are bad , i will not get this just to hide my gps away in an eye catching steal me monogrammed bag
i bought a second traveldrive because the first one purchased worked just fine the second drive does not work on my system \( windows millenium \) calling the service line i found out that there are two versions and the second is not compatible with the first after trying all the recommended solutions , the tech support suggested i request a warranty replacement trade for the original version or simply get my money back requests for a resolution of the matter have fallen on deaf ears i would not waste any more money on products from this company
we purchased this printer to replace old brother hl 1440 for our small business printing needs at first everything was great after 4 months of use , still on first toner cartridge , the manual feed can no longer grab labels or envelopes there is now a huge gap and the envelopes can slide all the way inside with no resistance huge problem for us and i hope we can return this piece of junk
when realtime traffic monitoring came to my city , i immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife 's daily business driving \( 2 500 miles weekly , crisscrossing a 50 mile area through major traffic routes \) i quickly settled on an automotive gps with realtime traffic monitoring there are not yet many choices in this area , so the options boiled down to this unit and the garmin 2720 \( these use fm radio for the traffic info the xm radio units like the tomtom 700 and garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since i do n't want xm radio \)
worked fine for a couple of weeks and then just died the problem was that it was not recognized by xp or linux anymore
this flash drive does not work with windows 98se the back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for windows 98se at the maufacturer 's web site first i tried downloading the driver turns out the driver is a zip file so i had to download winzip so i could unzip the driver after downloading the driver and winzip the flash drive is still not recognized by my pc the faq at the manufacturer 's web site states if the device is not recognized the bios on my pc must be enabled but the faq does n't tell you how to enable the bios
it does n't matter what dvd writer i used , velocity worked ! not one disk became a coaster i loved the velocity dvd r until i order 2 more spindles i ordered it directly for the manufacture when i received it , the outside plastic covering was cracked , half the disks had the jitters and the other half was coasters it seems to me that they trick you into ordering one with a great offer including free shipping if you order any more , the person shipping it to you send you the rejects from quality assurance i will never again order this product again period !
well , so far so bad i burned the dvds on my panasonic dvd recorder they play in my newer dvd players , but i cannot make a copy of them with sonic dvd , nero , or one click dvd unacceptable ! i have used many types of dvds , never had this happen i guess i know why some dvds i have purchased are playable , but not copiable it is the media ! i will stick with maxell , or tdk
worked for 6 hours , then just stopped transmitting what a waste of cash do not buy this
i had a terrible time getting a station to come in even close to fm quality there was always a bunch of static and the stereo buzzed between songs because i had to keep the volume too high the high band of frequencies seemed to work best , but then it led to crackling speakers everytime i turned something electrical on in the car it also seemed to kill batteries at a surprising rate
this is a total waste of money and engineering plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable fm player wrapping it back up and sending it back
the transmission quality is very poor i was unable to find a single frequency free of static while operating the belkin tunecast ii in my car i found that driving over or under bridges , under traffic lights , under power lines , or near large trucks increases the static to a level where the music can not be heard at all the only way i could get audio clarity equal to that of a dirty and scratched record or a distant am station was to hold the transmitter to the face of my radio what a piece of poo ! can i give it zero stars \? and do n't even get me started on the excessive packaging that you 'll need to use a diamond tipped jack hammer to open
if you have a palm , read this before buying this device
i have had two of these units i would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ml 300 save yourself some money and get something else both of the units lasted only 14 months i did hardly any typing with them only multi page forms and applications the printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing contacted brother international usa and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months save yourself some money and buy a big chief table and a number 2 pencil
after reading some good and bad reviews i went ahead and bought them anyway they will not stay in my ears , i tried the three different sized ear buds but non will do the job , very irritating
bought these and used them once had to remove them when i found myself in dire need of some excedrin migraine what do you get for your 39 \? cheap , tinny , bass less sound that 's like being plugged into a busted walkman the buds themselves do n't remain stable in the ear , so forget about using them while engaging in motion involved activity \( such as jogging , walking , head bobbing , neck movement , etc \) these are by far the worst earbuds on the market how could apple stoop so low \? do n't be fooled ! do a google search for these and you 'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product you 've been warned
i 've had this camera replaced by linksys 4 times the first time , was due to the camera crashing on a weekly basis the second replacement worked fine until i upgraded my router and switched from wep to wpa after the switch the camera would not connect to the router , switching back to wep , of course worked linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue , and with the last support call confirmed that there is a known problem with wpa encryption and this camera
i have extensive experience with wireless system setup and operation my whole system is all linksys gear after four hours on this camera , i give up
this is my first amazon review of any type i was quite happy to finally get a wireless keyboard and mouse when this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy it looks like someone painted the keys in a garage i expected better now i have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment , and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken i am not hard on the equipment and do n't know how it happened
this router had 1 4th the range of my standard linksys g router which suddenly burned out after less then a year the speed \( when i could get a signal \) was 1 to 11 mbps , my old router held a steady 54mbps i did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house , but i could n't use it with this router the expander only works with the basic g router , so no way to even boost the signal on this new one support was a joke , could n't get any help or explaination as to why the expanded range was so much less range the the previous unexpanded range bought another older version , and everything 's great again do n't waste your money or time on this
despite the slick marketing effort \( i e with srx \) , this product falls short
i am a huge logitech fan and buy their products in the truck load , unfortunately , this webcam is a dog with fleas the picture is blurry , the lighting is abmismal in low light and you can just get better performance from a less expensive web cam i am still a logitech fan , but you can get better performance from quickzoom

paid 34 at best buy for a cable that doesn't even work
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead , the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
these earphones provide excellent sound for the money rich bass , sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces
this does not fit the ipaq hx2755 do not try ! there are plenty of other cases out there that will work i ended up with a 94 cent digital camera case from wal mart that works better than this thing
this product is terrible and i'm going to return mine or throw it away it constantly wanders to places i do n't want it to be or trails where i think it should be based on my usage of other mice at this point i consider it unusable i 've tried it on several surfaces to see if it was a tracking problem , but noticed no real change in behavior i think what 's happening is it keeps trying to go to sleep while i'm moving it , because the tracking is ok as long as i'm moving it very quickly , but when i'm trying to precision target something like an icon or a piece of text it starts jumping erratically i keep it about 6 inches from my laptop at all times , and the laptop is n't complaining about connection problems
this is a nice 4 line phone , but the digital answering system does not work we have 2 984 's and several other brand 4 line phones i could not find any way to make either 984 work as a four line answering system auto attendent is useless in our situation these phones are certainly not worth the money unfortunately there are n't many 4 line phones on the market and apparently no 4 line digital answering systems
the first speaker came broken , i first called the manufacture but they wanted me to ship it at my cost for repair , that was not acceptable i then called amazon and you took the item back promptly
i ca n't get good reception at any range from source intermittent when two rooms away from source have to move the speaker unit around to find an acceptable location does n't automatically retune when being turned back on not at all what i expected from this piece of equipment
i assumed all tape adapters were comparable this one worked fine for 1 week then it sporadically ejected itself from the tap deck a few days later it broke completely and is now jammed in my tape deck the tape deck on my car stereo is now broken as is the macally podtape i would buy another a different brand of adapter , but i no longer have a tape deck that works in my car my worst purchase on amazon to date
have this optical cable for about a year before it was broken according to the package , it has lifetime warranty sent back to the company and got a rejected mail saying , company out of business , return to sender the company address on the label is
i tried to use it in my dell x50 and it hardly worked , was too slow , too short range , you have to unplug and plug it bacl again and again
i purchased this armband to hold my nano during workouts the band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training looking for a replacement right now
i purchased the 2 yrs warranty for my samsung lcd tv but i never received any information on it
the plug on the external antenna does bot fit the jack on the magellan unit avoid this until magellan figures this out seems like they would use a standard plug jack pair for all products
got this antenna from my wife for my birthday to go with my roadmate 760 i just purchased the antenna we received was the at 65 antenna instead of the large round antenna in the picture it was a small rectangular antenna \( 1 inch x 1 1 2 inch \) with no indication that it was an actual magellan antenna , on the unit itself the package had a magellan cardboard insert but this was definitely not the antenna pictured
unfortunately , i too received a switched item \( at 65 \) in a sealed magellan box today jennifer in customer service assured me that they will refund the purchase and that they will investigate the stock they have she was very apologetic and helpful i will see what happens but am thankful that she was there to help
using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe the distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration , just as it would be between a bike and a car
subwoofer should not be called that it 's tiny , and distorts if the slightest bass is put through it not good for music , not good for gaming steer clear
this radio is poorly built when you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out you put them back in , carefully set it down , then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again now , i put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review
i will not be sending this item to my frail 85 year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of florida it is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment this is unacceptable design failure for something the red cross is touting as a household essential
i had to return two faulty dvd players one would freeze frame the picture and the audio would keep on playing the replacement dvd player kept saying wrong disc and was very very loud when it would actually play a disc i ended up having to search and find a different dvd player all together because they would n't replace the 2nd faulty product \( which was packaged inappropriately and possibly damaged in shipment \)
the cigarette lighter adapter \( with speaker \) is really bad quality , the original one worn out within 1 year , i purchased a new adapter and worn out within 6 month garmin need to do better
short cord cannot be replaced , so do n't bother with this phone unless you can sit right by it to chat
this seller computer brain is charging 20 18 to ship these ink cartridges i knew the price was too good to be true
i ordered the passport x50 from amazon to save the 18 shipping escort radar was charging i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller
i 've got an engineering degree in computer science i 've been supporting multi million dollar web applications for years it took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for there is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player
i ordered this unit with high expectations , lots of memory , expandable , multiple modes , from a well known company and an excellent price how could i go wrong \? easily enough , as it turns out
i had high expectations for this product , having bought some of sandisk 's other products the problem with the e280 is that sandisk does n't give users the control or the versatility over file management for example , using it in the \( mass storage \) msc usb mode , one is forced to create playlists in windows media player this works , but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped
do not buy this item it is terrible
believe the opinions of most of the people who have made the mistake like me of buying this thing it is pure junk ! it has to be one of the worst hoaxes ever put over on consumers it does not work , and you can forget getting any real help or service out of griffin technology
it 's better if you spend your money in something else it has a ridiculous transmitting power so bad that even radio transmitters from miles away interferes with this device 1 ft from the radio receiver the audio quality is so bad that totally destroys the pleasure of listening to your music in fact this device should be forbidden to be sold or should be tagged as phony advertise
this is about the worse thing i 've ever bought for an ipod accessory it does not work all i heard was static , and very little music if you do want to hear music , you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you 'll get is static i bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it i was hesitant to buy it , seeing almost every review has said it does n't work but i bought it anyway , do n't buy it ! every review i 've seen has negative feedback for this item , and i agree with everyone i figured since griffin made a new itrip , it would be better and work great however , it is the total opposite from that i do not recommend this product at all do n't waste your time or money
never received the item have to go thru the process of filing a claim with ups for lost not delivered item no way to complain to amazon com
i purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews i , like others , cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on i even tired using the tricks described in another review
i wo n't recommend to any body you have the same way of charging thru your computer i think is waste
put the card in my w2000 pc , followed instructions got to the part about loading the driver , the book says to go to the drivers win2000 driver on the cd included in the box guess what , it 's not on the disk included in the box since i use a connection that needs this stupid card to work , now i have to find another pc and down load the driver
hard to figure out and organize music battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often do n't recommend it very not happy
a year later and i wish i had the money for an ipod i have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and do n't even take my player with me anywhere anymore what 's the point of having an mp3 player you ca n't walk around with \? ridiculous
we bought three creative players my husband and i have the zen micro and my daughter the zen 20gb all three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year i did n't even use mine but maybe two hours per week good thing my daughter 's was within her one year period by a couple of days she still had to pay 25 00 now my husband and i have to just junk ours and buy something else customer service is awful ! ! they wo n't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times what a piece of garbage ! !
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead , the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
i have a 5gb but a lot of the h10 's are having the same problem i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and ca n't be reinstalled i 've done a little research about the disappearing mp3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the h10 's and 1 other model i ca n't remember right now and iriver ca n't figure it out although i 've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug so buy with caution
i 've had this mp3 player since it came out and , if anyone is still considering getting it , i must advise otherwise the mp3 player itself looks and feels great , and the navigational features are very easy to use the problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable i have used 3 versions of this player \( expecting each time that the player was simply faulty \) , and all of them glitch up terribly i constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play it also freezes half of the time that i try to sync with wmp in addition , sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my h10 's list of tracks \( even though they no longer exist on the player \)
does not live up to expectations sound is tinny hard to find stations , very narrow band of reception plan to purchase a grundig
i ordered this mount for a sharp 20 inch lcd and it 's not that great it was very easy to install , however , the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level thus when the tv is pulled away from the wall , the set is not level and very annoying to look at i do n't believe this is a fault in the actual part , but the design of the arm this was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount and you get what you pay for
i 'd recommend selecting a different security cable product , especially if you have a powerbook or macbook this one is poorly made , even more poorly documented , and may have permanently damaged my powerbook g4 \( yes , the product web site claims this model is compatible with the pb g4 \)
total garbage no only this thing is huge , bigger than most mp3 players and it does n't have a belt clip or anything , it sounds awful , absolutely horrible the hiss others complained about is very loud , it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping , buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible , low dynamics and distorts easily this is a bad product that should be taken off the market it 's not even worth the price here heck , even 1 99 would be a waste of money avoid
it is a great idea , with a few qualifiers
it was great at first until the connector to ipod break by itself the bluetooth signal was n't the best , it loses signal constantly i had to re sync and paired it up several times over a month period the high price imuffs mb210 from wi gear gives a better promise with the ability to stop your ipod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone its bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on ipods with dock connectors , likely will not break as easily i sure hope logiteh will follow suit in this trend
the sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector all around poor quality and construction i'm thinking about returning it
it 's logitech it should have a built in microphone instead there 's a small head set do n't buy this spend a little more for a built in microphone
i have had this tv for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out , i called samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty they said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours 72 hours later still no call , i again called samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and i would be called in 24 hours , still no call this was repeated 5 times and each time i asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area
this is the third palm pda i have owned i bought the e2 directly from palm after my previous palm died it simply quit shortly after the warranty expired telephone support is poor and expensive after research this is a common problem
i am somewhat computer savvy i understand the the ip address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address they do n't match and i ca n't figure out how to change it i called netgear 4 days ago for help and they said their senior tech would have to call me back still waiting for that call back to staples it goes the installation appeared successful , but whenever i try to print , it says error printer is busy the so called instruction manual for this is laughable if you 're not an advance level it person , do n't try it
i bought this print server back in december 2005 i used it with my all in one brother printer mfc 4800 the installation was easy it worked great for 4 months then then it just stoped working after 4 months i tried to disconnect and reconnect the power , ethernet cable etc nothing helped
i had the same problems as already stated i am currently having the volume issue as well , and yes my batteries are weak \( the light is on \)
i waited 10 days for this to arrive the first time i plugged it in it ran for 2 minutes i typed dear and the machine typed wcm when i tried to erase wcm the erase mechanism did not work i turned the machine off and when i switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move , ie i cannot type or use the machine in any way when the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and i had to stick them back on now when i look at the machine i can see it is assymetrical there is a 1 4 gap in the base , so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere this is not acceptable but i have no way to contact whoever mstasad is i have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but i do n't have a typewriter that works i feel cheated and am very upset
i got 0 1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help but it did n't get any better you 'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you , i suppose
i bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging it was not true to what was said these batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera and a set of duracell ultras , that are not rechargeable , lasted longer do not always believe what you read make sure you have the ability to return items and is with this case , they went back i went with a set of energizers and they last much longer , with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand
i purchased the zen nano four months ago it was working then total system failure at first i thought the battery was dead , but a new battery did n't help the screen would flash on and then off it will not boot up plugging it into the computer did no good , it could not be reconized or accessed it goes in the trash in addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored also , the output volumn was to low i would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise , it was n't up to the task now it is landfill
i had to buy a new one , and i chose another brand \( logitech \) this time
do not buy this may be the worst product i 've ever bought it has never worked properly i 've kept fresh batteries in it , but it 's still no good within 10 feet of the laptop , i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then , i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen
do not buy this mouse !
i bought one of these it worked ok about three months and then just quit i do not recommend for anyone else
i tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and i could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs , but most of the time it failed i tried to record with an ipod no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives
got it home and it had poor focus the center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus the next morning the focus problem was gone go figure the big problem for me was the time it took to change channels a full 3 seconds went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs well i took it back and went to walmart and got a sanyo ht27546 for 270 good set with quick channel change it also has an optical digital outputwhich the toshiba did not the sanyo also has a full one year warrenty sound on both tvs is fine a small point the toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit mute
i posted a review two weeks ago , but it has n't appeared , so i'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove \( note despite what some other reviewers seem to think , it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock \) recently , the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook , despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support , i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently , the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook , i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus
mine did n't work out of the box just my experience i am taking this thing back to the store tomorrow i returned another crappy webcam today to buy this , so you can imagine how irritated i am with the lame quality of these things
as far as using the ipod as a recorder i think an actual digital recorder would get better sound the italk picks up all ambient sound i have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity
it 's partly my fault , of course i bought this to use on my motorcycle i thought the small size , especially the flat body , would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag i also bought a special handlebar mount for it unfortunately , i 've had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes whether you 're driving a car or a motorcycle , it 's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route maybe it was intended for pedestrians only the user interface for the gps is not intuitive \( at least , not for me \) , worse still , it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes the garmin helpline in the uk could only tell me to reset the machine each time not very helpful my guess is that the combination of palm pc and gps was too much for garmin to handle they should probably just stick to gps
i use it for my zen microphoto and it does not work at all it has the lowest battery life , used it for twenty mintues and it started to get worse and worse there is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the mp3 player below the transmitter , which is obviously dangerous while driving you can only tune it to four stations which are 88 1 , 88 3 , 88 5 and 88 7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an fm transmitter i seriously regret every buying this transmitter
it 'll do in a pinch but i hope there are better options
i 've spent over two hours tweaking this , and over an hour on the phone with customer support the thing still wont connect to the internet do n't get me wrong , the lights light up and my laptop can connect to the router , but the router wont connect to the internet
thinks my street is 50 feet before it actually is , therefore recalculates before the turn
this thing works well until a bulb blows out when i replace the bulb , it will not turn off after 4 minutes and i end up having to replace it
i knew i had to pay shipping for this cards \( 5 \) so i decided to buy 4 at once , what was my surprise that at checkout they wanted to charge me five dollars shipping for each card eventhough they were going to be ship together i decided not to buy them anymore they lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1 but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35 more than anywhere else its a shame that they try to rip you off that way buy them at the apple store on line , no shipping fee ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you pay only face value not a cent mor
why does a 15 00 gift card cost 24 00 \? i was going to get one but first someone explain this to me \? is the card itself made out of gold \? whaz up wit dat
i loved my little seagate 5 0gb drive , even after the first one crashed and burned but the second time , i cannot forgive i carried it everywhere in my pocket , and maybe that was part of the problem , but if it ca n't handle that then it is no good to me solid state memory , here i come
i dislike ipods so i figure i try something else and hope for the best unfortunately i was wrong
the mouse worked well with my chipset , but beaware that earlier bluetooth chipsets do not have the power to work with this mouse , although the dongle that is bundled with this is excellent
i bought this phone for a work at home situation i then discovered that the maximum number of characters i could enter into a speed dial entry \( the number itself , not the name \) is 24 characters a telephone calling card number is 25 characters long , 26 if you program a pause \( a space , for this phone \) between the phone number and the card id pin when i called polycom about it , i was told that not everyone uses calling cards funny i 've been issued a calling card at every company for which i 've worked \( going back 25 years \) this is the only phone i 've ever owned \( well , since the 80 's \) into which i could not program my calling cards pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss
this thing sucks i wasted my money no more griffin products for me
the transmitter does n't work i tried everything i could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt
this item said that it is compatible with all ipods but it is not it is only compatible with the old ipods evidently there is a difference in some of the more recent ipods and this itrip does n't work with them we had to return the product
i just got these at a local store and they just really blow ! ! ! i was swayed by the brand name and the great price \( although higher than amazon \) it 's true when they say you get what you pay for rock bottom price rock bottom performance terrible to say the least mine are going back right now
mine worked great for the first few months , then i started getting the warning , check battery if you take the batteries out and reinsert , it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up it happened on both headsets i called customer service and they told me this is the first time they 've ever heard that \( uh huh does n't sound like it from the reviews here \) a little too expensive to replace yearly
i 've had this mouse for about a month use it with my mac g4 at home and i'm exhausted it feels very nice in the hand and i really like the scrolling ball feature \( hence the 2 stars \) , but it 's just not predictable sometimes it glides along smoothly , most other times it tracks across the monitor like you 're mousing over pebbles i 've tried a number of different surfaces desktop \( light woodgrain \) smooth , medium gray fabric mouse pad mouse pad made specifically for optical mice \( better than the other two \) and i have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission to no avail it still lags and i have a hard time honing in on an object to select it \( or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle \)
for my powerbook my first bluetooth mouse \( a macally bt \) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk so for the replacement i read the reviews and went with the kensington bluetooth mini primarily for the on off functionality
one of the reasons i chose this mouse , was because apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling it turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others it jerks one line at a time the clicking is quite loud i might add also , i have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if i do n't sometimes just clicking on system preferences corrects the problem , but if i had it to do over , i 'd buy something else
i bought this in april for my new canon 30d and it worked great until several months ago when i would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying data corrupted it started out slowly then it would lose every third picture i tried to reformat the card and got an error message now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer it was a wonderful card while it lasted but i too am hesitate to get another one hopefully mine was a lemon too but then again
this seemed like a great card at a great price unfortunately after 4 months , during the middle of a paid shoot , all of the images instantly dissappeared i stopped using the card , put it aside until i got home i tried to use software to recover the images only a few could be recovered , the rest were gone i 've not been able to re format the card in either a canon eos 5d , digital rebel , or using software on my computer the card is now completely un usable
i purchased 3 of these aps with the expectation to replace 3 cisco b aps and drop in the setup used radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs after config \( the web ui constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re login \) the system would work one quark was the ip address field for the radius server would n't accept more than one character in the forms up and running however , upon reboot , the wg302 loses it radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again showstopper after logging this with netgear support their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support while this would be fine if it was a config issue , it 's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase they give no further support now
first a disclaimer i know very little about telephone headsets , but decided to buy one because i had a series of long telephone meetings coming up
since i first wrote this review i discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer after formatting my computer i was able to install the scanner and software without any problems i am still learning to use it but so far i have decided not to return it it works well and i like it very much i apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone 's choice
i have approximately 10 , 000 slides to scan i purchased the 4850 and after about 3 , 000 slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image after reporting it to hp they sent me a replacement tma the new tma worked fine for the first 450 slides and then bingo , i now am getting two dark blue lines again i think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load i have
my daughter really did n't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart the wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it a low price for a guitar but i do n't think it 's even worth this price
these phones had so much static , you could not hear ! ! ! we ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use !
i bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2 line phone with answering capability turns out , i cannot keep it , due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me
my very first cell phone was motorola , and it served me great , so i became attached to the brand based on that experience , and for that reason alone bought motorola sd4591 digital corded cordless system as we 've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks the battery life got very short very soon too i was told i need to get different batteries nih instead of nicd naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too as we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5 8hz 2 line phone i decided to get motorola md7091 5 8ghz digital 2 line phone and remained loyal to motorola and boy was i wrong again what others are saying about caller id not showing as soon as i have another phone on the same line besides motorola md 7091 is true in my case too i do n't get it does motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones \? \? \? this is really cheap trick
now , imagine my astonishment after receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers , i set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base !
i had high hopes for this case when i bought it , but it just has n't worked out the leather has a nice feel , and my ipaq fit snugly in it 's slot however the stylus on my ipaq h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the ipaq from it 's case this became so frustrating that i eventually discontinued using this case
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall i thought the first one was a defect , but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it what i do n't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it satisfaction guaranteed what a joke
ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no \? if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4 also the video you convert may have a few complications , the audio and video may not be sychronized at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download com and search for jodix video converter this is not from speculations i have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted suggestion check out the creative zen vision m sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it
i bought with lots of ilussion this this ipod , i put all my music in it and use it ! ! after a 5 months it stop working , it did n't charge the battery i took it to best buy where i bought it and they told me that it has external damage and didn' repair it i send it to apple service and return it without services because the same reason my ipod did n't have that damage , it has only a few scratches on the screen after lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it i would have to pay us 250 00 that is almost what it cost new terrible service from apple short live don't recommended now i'm looking for another option for mp3 player to buy
like other fm transmitters i have tried , this one leaves much to be desired living in a major urban area , i was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality product is easy to use , but i consider the sound quality unacceptable
the phone worked for a month or two , and then the handset stopped seeing the base when i followed the instructions in the manual to fix this \( re register the handset to the base \) , neither could see each other
i'm pissed i feel i 've been ripped off the 3rd party vendor delivered a defective unit i want to return it i have been unable to determine how to return this unit for a refund i may never buy through amazon again
this product did not reliabley work in a new sony psp running the current sony software do n't know if the design is flawed or the unit i received was defective
got it and plugged it into my ipod and there was a major incompatibility the screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the ipod but when i went to record i received an error message that the ipod could not locate a microphone perhaps an ipod problem \? the ipod is a 4th generation 40 gig that is fully updated i think belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new ipods , with the exception of the minis have not been able to resolve the issue i am sure ipod will state that it is a belkin problem and that belkin will throw the ball back to ipod \? \? \? \?
i just received my pair today , and i have to say , i'm extremely dissapointed yes , they are comfortable , but the bass is almost absent , no matter how far you jam them into your ears , the bass is n't nearly what it were hyped to be , it definently is n't enough for the amount of mid hi 's they produce unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max , i 'd recommend another pair of earphones if you 're just looking for comfort and you do n't like hardly any bass , these are your headphones but , as others said , you can find much better earphones for a much lower price
the first thing i did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually was an apple product its really cheap looking looks like something you 'd find for at a flea market or in the stocking stuffers section of the dollar store at christmas time the nano is small so almost anything will hold it , including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit
3 more of the useless flimsy holders you get in the ipod box !
i had a very poor experience with the microsoft media center infrared keyboard and i wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would i thought get rid of all connection problems
this hardware is well made and i have heard very good things about the non bluetooth version of the mouse when it 's connected and working , it does its job very well unfortuntately the mx5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively at seemingly random intervals , the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether if this happens during gameplay , you 're in a bad way the keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug when it comes off of its sleep state , it will double the first key you press i have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue add in that the setpoint software for the lcd screen only fully works with two pieces of software \( musicmatch and windows messenger \) , and you have a very disappointing desktop package the mx1000 is a great mouse on its own , but stay away from this bluetooth combo it is unstable and very frustrating to use
the unit works fine as a bluetooth radio
does not work at all dont throw away your money should read 0 star
i had vonage since april , 2006 i finally switched back to qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone \( my cell phone , as my vonage line did n't work \) with tech support here is my experience
i bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal , and provide features that traditional phone companies do not good thing i kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with vonage
stay away from vonage ! after more than 1 month , still do n't have phone number transferred ca n't get thru to customer service very long wait paying 2 phone bills so much for saving cost and so called service called to cancel service , and customer service rep promised to put account billing on hold until phone number transfer is done finally something positive from customer service department
very disappointing speakers !
i too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose i bought another thinking i had a faulty one , but now i'm having the same issue with this one the loose jack causes the reception to go in and out and finally just out completely i agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw
1 there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base
i bought this and found that if you like to burn your own cd 's to play in it , it has a problem reading the tracks it sometimes spins up and does n't play , and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find i usually wake to that sound before the music starts i am not a light sleeper this is my second one , and i 've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months do yourself a favor and find a different product
this product does not have the skip feature included in the product descriptio
your buying 128 mb worth of frustration and 10 worth of gas from back and forth to wal mart
the keyboard and mouse work fine , except for some completely absurd reason , logitech decided to remove the insert and escape keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead look at the picture and you will see what i mean the delete key is double size and takes up the space where the insert key would be insert is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button escape is in the usual place , but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key very annoying definately returning it
ordered it , took about 5 days to get to me , and it 's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it
i was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes
the jbl speakers worked fine for 3 weeks and all of a sudden , they quit in the future , i will buy this type of merchandise locally so that i have some recourse
i was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews , however , i have been extremely disappointed in them i may have had too high of expectations , but these things put out no bass whatsoever \( it just sounds muffled and cruddy \) , and the overall sound is extremely poor i'm really surprised as i 've owned jbl speakers in my car that i was extremely pleased with , so i'm amazed at the lacking quality in these i would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included
these speakers sound great but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that 's a no no so you reach for your phones and no place to plug them in ! how lame is that \? also whoever designed the volume on off knob is an idiot the thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it , the whole speaker just slips away from you they 're so light that they do n't have enough resistance to stay put so you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other \( unless you velcro them to your desk or something \) too bad because like i said they sound great
agree with the prior reviewers i can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses !
i have bought several of these some came in a fancy blister , and others in a coushing bag stay away from those be sure you 're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different
i bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with sd memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card \( xd and memory stick \)
