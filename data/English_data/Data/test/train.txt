dale carnegie is one of the authors i have admired for so long there are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one he deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it of course , there are many negative people who do n't like this book because they see everything in black and white carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate , positive and humane approach to everyone around you it comes very close to treat the others as you want them to treat you i am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book , the world will be a better place i am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important his viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex after all genius things are usually simple carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples i liked that the book is practical , easy and fun to read , and most of all that it delivers great value i can not say the same for many other books definitely get a copy especially if you are a good person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity

barrow , an astronomer at the university of sussex when this book was published , provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics \? what 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have \? what accounts for what physicist eugene wigner has called , in a now famous paper , the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences \( 299 \) \? after an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers , barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism , inventionism , intuitionism , and platonism , a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor perhaps most mathematical workers follow what alfred korzybski called the 'christian science' school of mathematics , which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities \( science and sanity 748 \) i commend barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly barrow 's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations as for barrow 's conclusions , from a non aristotelian view , the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification , the confusion of orders of abstracting barrow does n't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics he seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him as korzybski pointed out , we live in a world of multi dimensional , ordered structures or relations it does not seem unreasonable , then , that we can map this world with an exact language of relations , i e , mathematics but as korzybski also pointed out many times , the map is not the territory quot
this is one of those life changing books i first came across this while looking midlessly through my local spiritual bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours
this book was mind expanding , and told a great story of exploring the facets of one 's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others my favorite part was the story of the golden pages where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man 's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery , but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm , if not war

suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in the mystery portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired i really did n't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin , who clearly stole the show in this book

as a prospective college student , i have to tell you how much i appreciate students' guide to colleges it combines many of the best features of the princeton review and fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness i also appreciate that it is without any trying to sound hip blather because these are not editor interjected profiles , they 're written by actual students this is a great compliment i have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year , and this is the best guide to colleges among the many i 've seen i also just read the oberlin college profile in this book with an oberlin alum and relative she said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate oberlin portrayal she 's read in a guide among other things , she and i loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable in previous guides questions like what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour \? the guide 's honesty also impressed me , as the fiske guide lauded vassar 's diversity , for example , where students' guide admits although vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot , most students are actually wealthy and white i am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from hampshire to harvard will find this book incredibly useful ! !

i am a lutheran church librarian and i am glad i bought this very satisfactory book for our church library its text stresses that children are the same the world over they have the same feelings and needs , and have the same hopes and dreams the illustrations are a nice change from the usual each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded the illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor , drawn in persian style the colors are very saturated the book 's cover gives you an idea of what they look like the message of this book is one of diversity that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities , races , ethnicities , languages or faiths , they still have the same hopes , dreams and daily needs this is a very important message for children to hear in today 's world where there is so much suspicion of those we perceive to be different the more children realize that kids are the same everywhere , the more tolerant they will be children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age , say researchers , so you have to nip it in the bud very early , and this book does that in a wonderful way

going into the business , i bought this book and found it very helpful this one as well as i'm living your dream life by michele cozzens are well worth the money
i originally bought this for my almost 2 year old because i wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown \( there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom \) instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters the reason this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging it is a beautiful book that provides i spy and where 's waldo type challenges i highly recommend this book for the 1 5 crowd

as a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text mechanism and theory in organic chemistry by lowry and richardson , this book by anslyn and dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student i agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging , the text is clearly written , and the material relates well back to current research issues if you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program , get this book before you try advanced organic chemistry structure and mechanisms by carey and sundberg i expect that modern physcial organic chemistry will become a staple to most chemist 's shelves similar to that of a crc handbook or advanced organic chemistry by march
line by line , this book has some of the best writing i 've seen in a while this is an amazing thing , since it 's still very fast moving and not at all overwritten the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor the book surprised me constantly with its insights , and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week i read craig 's first book , and it does n't stand up to this at all it 's exciting to see how much the writer has improved , and i ca n't wait for the next one
alistair maclean combines psychology , action , history , sociology , and intrigue into a wonderful spy story the hero potrtays a tried and true james bond without the condescending attitude there 's none better
i 've read , and re read the book , although not it 's full content , but randomly i open it and find a surprise each time i just love it
i 've gotten through about 1 3 of the book and i'm highly amused the first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far however , i 've laughed my way through them one thing eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor if you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that 's loaded with wit , i 'd suggest picking up this book i never knew there were four kinds of people before morons , fools , lunatics and cretins and i may just be a fool \)
this entry in the fang mulheisen series came as a surprise it was closer to something by elmore leonard or even carl hiaassen great , engaging characters , funny dialogue and an excellent plot
if you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics i started with once a month cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary , but , though i loved it was a hard days work then came jill bond and she was really talking bulk cooking ! when deborah 's first book came out i was excited because it fit in with my low on cash , short on time lifestyle
i had eyed this book for quite some time before i purchased it , and i am so glad i did ! the pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book ! most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based , so do n't pick this book up looking for lots of kid friendly drinks \( though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy , such as a s'mores hot chocolate \) the recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty , piping hot drinks
this is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution , how it will wither away , and what a society should look like \( or try to mould itself into \) after the revolution lenin , drawing on the works of marx and engels extensively , refutes many claims by both the anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state , and corrects many common errors believed about the marxist road to socialism this is a thoroughly informative read i recommend those wondering how a communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book it will open your eyes widely
this book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre it does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16 bar piece of a song for you ! great for auditions the book has selections from musicals \( old and new , familiar and rare \) , as well as movies \( even some disney ! \) there 's one for every vocal part granted , not every piece is exactly 16 bars some go a bit over , but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing it 's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out it 's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals
the big sky is not just a masterpiece , it 's probably the masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction this is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that is n't really dealt with that much the rocky mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 1850 the cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature , partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in cowboy movies mirror our own experiences in many ways the cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to americans , when actually nothing was further from the truth cowboys were regular working stiffs , about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day they did n't consider themselves free , nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day they did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage , and there was a bit of swagger to it people in town recognized cow hands for the tough as leather men they were , especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had but it was backbreaking work , and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years
this is a great compliment to the more project based make magazine , as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the makers of course , it also describes \( and shows , in beautiful photographs \) , their projects , but it 's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers , bored brainiacs , and fringe worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the diy geek culture creating incredible , real world projects , from the mega \( a home built submarine for 3 \) to the micro , \( a diy bat detector \) , to the whimsical \( a lego blocks project that will solve the rubik 's cube \)
a wild and crazy ride on a submarine stuck in the arctic ice this book is full of crazy characters ! both two legged and four legged a must read for anyone looking adventure in the high arctic
this one i read before i started leaving my reviews on amazon it 's a wonderful story you 'll love the characters absolutely a 5 star read

i thought this was an excellent book those who say this wo n't turn you into a champion overnight , i 've got news for you no book can do that only you can i 've raced \( retired now \) for most of my adult life including some pro races , some of my crew have gone onto champ cars , nascar , and f1 , i was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the champ car title and my engineer was from that team this book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career those who ca n't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they do n't need to buy any books , but most of us do n't have last names like andretti , senna , unser , etc if any of you have ever read senna 's book on driving you might also say it 's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to , not what he writes directly about few people will directly give you the secrets to motorsports
peter watson , holding a number of research degrees , offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book not being an easy read , it takes some time to get through

i absolutely loved this book ! i could relate to each of the four women at different times in their lives it reminded me to take all things to him in prayer at all times
it was a gift for my nephew and it delivered he just could n't put it down before he recognized all the characters
having worked with vbscript for a little over four years i am by no means an expert however , i feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting i was pretty skeptical when i saw the word advanced in the title , but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters
rather than reading a biography of red auerbach , wilt chamberlain and bill russell , turn to this period book ! here you get everything a complete portrayal of the situation of african american who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the brooklyn dodgers but at the same time it is an introduction to a time , when athletes were not the superstars of today

if one approaches this book with a view to learning music theory , one would be slightly disappointed the author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type all in all , i think this book will come in useful after i 've learned music and need to review theory from time to time great book though
i'm a fan of bill myers work and have been since blood of heaven this one slipped by me somehow and when i saw it i immediately got it while the plot is somewhat tight for the most part , i do have some problems with parts of it for one thing , the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him \( read the book to find out \) should n't have any qualms about killing millions of others so why is he so intent on the stones \? but the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old the minute anything happens , they 're all screaming each other 's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it for the first time emergency , we can live with it but when something happens every few chapters , you 've got to have a break ! daniel ! tyler ! helen ! tyler ! daniel ! dad ! helen ! tyler ! give me a break ! otherwise , a good story though not up to the same level as threshold or blood of heaven \( definitely better than eli though \) recommended

i admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in piece of my heart di stanley chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert his teenage daughter has facts to hide and di chadwick walks a fine line dci alan banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder
the third book of a series and follow the story line i have not finished it yet but am enjoying it
ed hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it does n't do justice to the man himself his dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them having shared some of his adventures but as a cop , i found that he loves cops if it was n't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one
v i lenin wrote this book in 1917 , while he was hiding from the russian government lenin pointed out that the question of the relation of the state to the social revolution , and of the social revolution to the state , like the question of revolution generally , was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the second international \( 1889 1914 \) he wanted to correct that oversight , and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book

this book is the best book on rand 's esthetics i 've ever read in fact , it is the only book on the topic that i know of it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by rand they approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory they demolish abstract art , and devote considerable energy to discussing rand 's definition of art they even propose their own individual alternatives ! if anything shows independence , it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work ! remarkable ! the world of rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship that is clear just by reading one of the reviews here , by people who are devotees of certain scholars who do nothing but repeat the catechism they take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published that is why they hate this book because it is independent minded judge for yourself do n't be fooled

good books on popular music are , frankly , few and far between this is one of those precious few journalist dan leroy has done a remarkable job of piecing together the details of the creation of this album even better , he has written an engaging story it might be a cliche , but i could n't put it down
this book shows you in an easy to read format the true capabilities of the dvd format and what is required to do it it helped me in being able to ask intelligent questions when purchasing equipment
what i like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it , and i bet he 'll take a look inside some books are so clinical others do n't provide enough information this one gets it right at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader as someone who has been writing for girls for years , i'm always curious about what is out there for boys , and i like daldry 's style
haccp is the acronym for hazard analysis of critical control points this text , by arduser and brown is the be all and end all on the topic in my view it even comes with a companion cd rom that contains all forms from the book in adobe acrobat \( pdf \) and ms word format this is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired
i love this little recipe book ! it is very simply written , but informative everything from what a crepe is and how to turn them , stack them , freeze them , and thaw them , to diagrams on folding crepes and blintzes , and , of course , the recipes the basic crepe recipe followed by all the variations , as well as dessert crepes and blintzes have n't tried very many yet , but am looking forward to it especially the orange dessert crepes
another incredible read from cj box i'm intrigued in the manner he sets up the future of joe pickett in each of his books i could n't put this one down
i studied the medieval islamic world a little in college , and fell in love it 's a fascinating age in which central asian buddhists , north african nomads , ethiopian slaves , greek cave dwellers , persian aristocrats , arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together , mixed , wrote wonderful literature , and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun but it 's hard to find anything written about the time that is n't arcane professor babble or islam 101 \( you know , there are five pillars of islam snore \)
with all the sensationalism and relentless obfuscation of the realities of life by the media i found this an exhillarating and thought provoking book there 's more , but i'm sure you 'll read and revisit this book again and again once it 's prominently displayed on your bookshelf worth every penny
pamela jaye smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters , which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth she has an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology , spirituality and metaphysics yet her real gift is being able to relate all of this amazing information in an entertaining and clear manner so that it 's easy to understand the book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures i highly recommend it
in this study demos examines family life as it was for the pilgrims who came over on the mayflower , before they joined with the massachusetts bay colony the book is in three main sections the physical setting \( housing , furnishings , and clothing \) the structure of the household \( family connections , including servants \) and individual development \( childhood , coming of age , and old age \) the most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the court although laws were not draconian , they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly mess up and you would be punished but it 's also true that people were not that different back then , either parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them families were at the core of society 's welfare even women were given rights denied them in the mother country it 's interesting that even these first settlers saw the american continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized , and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from plymouth itself , thus weakening communal ties a highly recommended book
this book is a big hit with my pre k class ! i was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while i was reading this they have memorized most of the book they all loved it ! an excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures ! i 'd definitely recommend reading this book to with ages four through maybe second grade

i really enjoyed this work didnt know this guy won a pulitzer but it figures i was swept away by the imagery created by this master it was evocative of cooper \( although he surpasses cooper \) , and mcmurtry and the guy who wrote all the pretty horses the master can always create the world to drown the reader in this guy is great i plan to read the whole series
in a hobby filled with opinions , this was a one stop shop for beginning to up and running of my first large aquarium it was exactly what i was looking for in a book of this nature i'm not going to say it 's the best , worst or in between because it 's the only one of this nature i bought
anna anderson anastasia
it 's been around two years since i first read this book , and i must say i reference it to people all the time the reason it is so darn fascinating i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data if i gave you an 8 track tape right now , would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it \? younger folks might not know what it is they would recognize tape \( maybe \) , but 100 years from now , how many players would be around \? the book talks about a project the author was on a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans \( or others \) in the future that the site is radioactive since the radiation could last 10 , 000 years , the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now what would the message be like \? if you read the book you 'll find out ! lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just could n't put the book down buy it , have fun

things are going swimmingly in fish ! land in the latest volume , fish ! tales , authors stephen c lundin , john christensen , harry paul and philip strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first fish book tales shows how four companies a long distance call center a hospital neural renal unit , a car dealership and a roofing company have applied fish ! theories effectively they also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the fish ! function the four main principles are familiar by now keep the work fun , seek to serve others , stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude but the examples in the book bring them alive along the way , the authors heavily sell their fish ! courses and merchandise that 's just good salesmanship but the real catch of the day is the final how to section , showing ways to apply these principles in any organization the lively writing style helps keep you hooked we suggest that if you have n't yet caught any fish ! , start with this one its cheery , accessible methods should lure you in , hook , line and sinker
while some may think that good work should be readable and enjoyable , great work is meant to elevate us stun us , amaze us , fill us with wonder otherwise , see spot run would be a masterpiece

michael hauge is not only a master at helping you elicit emotion from your story , he now also shows you how to do it in 60 seconds and generate nothing but excitement for your project
i really enjoyed this book i thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book there were some character changes and some additional characters in the book , but i do n't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there i read the book after seeing the movie i always wondered what the movie had been based on i love baseball , and i think the book was great
this novel is more enjoyable than the flanders panel , but still not up to the level of the fencing master or his recent series , the captain alatriste books the characters are well drawn , the setting comes alive , and the story flows there are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp , but i cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original the only real disappointment came when i finished the book i wish there was a follow up

people were looking for a book that could grab them about nam when this was a best seller in 1972 , and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in nam itself as a primary consideration portions of this book originally appeared in `the new yorker , ' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared frances fitzgerald 's original trip to vietnam was in february to november of 1966 , and resulted in articles for the `atlantic monthly , ' the `village voice , ' `vogue , ' etc people who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like nam , where large numbers of young americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion
this was the very first jonathan kellerman book i had ever read this is by far the best one he ever wrote i do n't think that i have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful it 's like watching a top notch horror mystery movie this has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone i still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now i give this book a 5 star rating
those interested in american art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book chicago and new york are the centers from which katharine kuh radiated as a museum curator , art dealer , and published critic , she was personally close to many of the modern masters in this book , she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives i especially liked the chapters on rothko , tobey and noguchi
if you 're an easily offended religious fanatic who 's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs i guess you should n't read this \( actually , you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels \)
i was so impressed with this book that i wrote the following letter to its author
i bought this for my classroom bookshelf i teach 7th grade science and my kids fight with each other to read it

i was at the sfmoma to see her yes exhibition , and exactly what i expected , i was overwhelmed with delight her art is whimsically amazing her music touches your heart and soul seeing all the people there that day , i was glad that yoko is finally getting all the respect she deserves , after all these years also caught her live performance at the los angeles 's roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away i truly think she 's one of the true visionaries of our time
i loved this book ! i picked it up on a whim at the airport , and could n't put it down for the entire flight now i'm telling all my friends to get it not only does it have tips about playing cards , but it 's just a flatout pageturning thriller you keep wondering where this guy 's life is going to lead him next very suspenseful and funny too highly recommended
this book brings together , pratical budget concerns with fashion , which are often in two totally different universes not worlds , universes in the fashionista there is everything from how to get wine out of a shirt to when to know if you should splurge on a coat in the worlds of increase american debt , this book should be on everyshelf in america ! it is light portable and she is extremely funny ! two thumbs up

first grade takes a test 8221 is an excellent , multicultural book that should be in every elementary classroom , especially kindergarten thru 3rd grades for it 8217 s use in demonstrating that the really important things in life aren 8217 t measurable , and even as a tool for helping students understand and interpret poorly worded questions \( and there will always be a handful of them on any standardized test \) , the book is invaluable highly recommended from this early childhood teacher
if i were to choose the two best novels by this author , they would be the nautical chart and the queen of the south the fencing master , by comparison , is n't as lively or as intellectually thrilling but it is a chewy read i particularly loved the characterization of don jaime as an older man realizing what he has lost in his life
most people are in awe of the classic however , a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts , rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition classics do not only thrill and teach , they also live
at 37 , john wade was lieutenant governor of minnesota at 40 , he ran for the u s senate he was heavily favored to win at 41 , he was n't just beaten in the primary , he was crushed loser by landslide
an absolutely magnificent peice of literature ! the use of language is witty and funny and i have never experienced such joy from a collection of short stories before the ''is he deep \? '' introduction set the mood of the bok and that question played on mind throughout the entire read fantasti
robert barid 's exploration of history 's secret connections is brilliant by integrating hidden and not presented in any other book various facts of sciences , he clearly shows that our ancestors had much deeper understanding of the reality than most of the modern people i had a chance to explore many other books by this author available from his page on the world mysteries com and i highly recommend all of them
the gospel of judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame it is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the christian faith like its many predecessors , it gave national geographic and anti christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of jesus a book titled the gospel of judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly , shot straight back down still , while its popularity was short lived , it allowed bart ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of christ surely ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered , \( the gospel of judas \) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century it rivals the finding of the dead sea scrolls or the gnostic gospels of nag hammadi
peter robinson is one of my favorite authors when i travel on vacation i make sure to take his latest novel piece of my heart transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago the characters were well developed and the story line moved there were many layers of sub plots that were interwoven i thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion
de mystifying a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians , educators , and musicians , and has been overdone unlike them , but not unlike a master performer , palmer is able to strike a balance between technique , feeling , and authenticity he is historically and musically adept without denying the blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance

the plot is stronger than dick and jane , not quite at the dr seuss level but my 4 year old loves the thing he wants to read it what more can one ask for a first reader than self motivation \? good illustrations , basic vocabulary , frequent repetition , and not scary
this is probably the single best work i 've ever seen on the science of packing joe back lived and worked in n w wyoming , and was a legend in the area his humorous annecdotes , and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams , combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject , make this a must have for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules , and survive this little work deserves a place in any packer 's library
some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book although in fact it is not an easily readable book , for the general public , if you have a serious interest about the history of the third reich , make no mistake you will not be able to overlook this book , which will surely be a classic it is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism the interaction between the new domestic and international values , based on aggression and the other causes involved in the rise \( and fall \) of the iii reich from a different perspective from other mainstream historians , this winner of the samuel johnson prize for non fiction , has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat , one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history no wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus a new history particularly well deserved of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law , a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian fuhrerprinzip
dark nature cuts to the very core of the will to survive mr watson takes you on an easy to read journey up the food chain to the homo sapiens who is neither man nor kind for me , dark nature removed judgment from the word evil , giving a deeper , behind the scene look at what drives life a must read this copy was purchased a gift in my judgment to continue to grow i needed to understand this piece of myself and the world around me
as a professional bridal consultant , i keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings ms mcbride 's bridal flowers is one of my favorites it is full of wonderful ideas not just the traditional must have wedding flowers such as bouquets boutonnieres , but the out of the ordinary \( but inspiring \) boas , decorated lampposts gilded calla lilies ms mcbride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn the large color photos are fantastic so many other books have little or no photos , or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering ms mcbride 's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about it does n't claim to be a how to book , but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer
this rare book details aleister crowley 's ascension as the prophet of a new aeon , the aeon of horus out of all the aleister crowley books in mass market format , this stood out in memory years after i read it as one of crowley 's most disturbing works in fact , i questioned my new faith in crowley 's religion thelema reading this book this was for real and not a joke after contemplating , i thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today 's youth and crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today this is serious stuff , i would n't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult it should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work i did a ritual from necronomicon and lesser key of solomon to help with a college astronomy course i got a respectable c grade when i close to failing with a d but be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism
this is a wonderful book , which my children adore , and which taught them each to recognize the instruments in the orchestra before they were three
the patterns in this book are really interesting they range from everything to cabled belts to baby booties to light sweaters this is n't as informative as the original stitch 'n bitch book , but if you have mastered the basics , it is a good starting point for ideas plus , it has tried and true tips and tricks from knitters accross the nation
twain 's account of his years on the mississippi is part travel book , part memoir , and part historical work , with a few sketches , stories , and tall tales tossed in for good measure there is even an outtake from the not yet published huckleberry finn , along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors this smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book , but much of it shows mark twain at his humorous and humanistic best
i like the way it teaches fractions and does n't use candy
this is a terrific book for young and older children it is a fun way to demonstrate why we need a universal form of measurement
i love this book ! ! i 've owned it for about a year now , but just got it back after a very long visit to my mother in law \( 3 months \) she loved the book also and did n't want to give it back ! she bought one of her own ! thank goodness ! i think she got tired of reading the recipes over the phone to me ! lol ! anyways great book , lots of information also great for what ever size machine you have does small \( 1lb \) , med \( 1 1 2lbs \) and large \( 2lbs \) for each recipe
how this book flew under the nation 's radar i 'll ever know furthermore it 's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized
on the way to a conference in new orleans , my flight from raleigh to charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems , and i was booked on a flight to d c as i boarded the plane with the carolina way under my arm , a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how i was enjoying the book i explained that i had not yet started the book , so i could not give an answer the gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as dr gerald bell , the co author of the carolina way myself a carolina fan , i was pleased to meet dr bell , as he spent several minutes talking about coach smith , whom i have admired for over forty years , and the unc basketball program , which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under coach roy williams dr bell 's contributions to the book tie coach smith 's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from carolina 's storied history to today 's business situations surely , coach smith , given his ability to recruit top players , has been criticized by many for his failure to win ncaa championships in the manner of coach john wooden at ucla , but winning two ncaa championships , winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict ncaa rules , and coaching top players that graduated at a 90 rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of coach smith 's system teamwork , integrity , loyalty , and hard work , are the cornerstones of the carolina way , and anyone in the position of managing , leading , or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book , corny as it is at times this book is not just for carolina basketball fans
this is my favorite jonathan kellerman novel the book focuses on a disturbing story about munchausen 's disease by proxy this book so quickly caught my interest , that i ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease i had not heard of this disorder when i read the book it was disturbing , intense , and tore away at your heart i would definitely recommend this book ! munchausen 's disease seems to have become a more popular topic since i read this book i have seen countless documentaries on , and it was also featured in the newest episode of house it is a disturbing , yet intriguing disease , and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it , munchausen 's disease by proxy
the story of illidan , malfurion , rhonin , and krasus using dark powers , heroic strength is enough to blow anyone away iy enchants me , it shows the world of warcraft from a combination of knaak 's and blizzard entertainment 's imagination
my three year old loves this and i do too ! it is a great book to share at xmas as well the pictures are wonderful and we are giving it to nursery school as part of chinese new year celebration
as an overweight , stressed out , 40 something professional , i am thrilled to find this book ! the spark is exactly what i needed to get my body moving again i am one of those who had fallen for the 1 hour a day exercise trap , and if i did n't have an hour , which i usually do n't , i just did n't exercise i love doing my three to four sparks a day , knowing i am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when i can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout this is a wonderful concept , and so doable ! it 's working ! ! thank you
always think twice never jump to hasty conclusions without considering all the effects of an act or decision that 's the essence of economics looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy
i found this in the church library , but it is not christian fiction it is simply an easy read the story is sweet , made even sweeter by the topic cake i am not even much of a cake person i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies cookies , etc but , as i read , i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator i do n't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet the need for sweets will be simply overpowering
overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a do the mix of recipes is fine , but they just seemed to be missing something they were all more or less of the huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done variety all of the recipes look tasty , though i would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes , especially some more creative ones let 's be honest , when you pay for a book you 'd like to see more than put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated dutch oven , salt and pepper to taste , cook until done quot give me a little something to work with here ! inspire me ! i can already cook a roast like this in the oven having said all of that , i would still reccommend this book the vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and i ca n't wait to try some of them as an aside , this is the only dutch oven book i 've seen with heart healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare given that the average do book requires the use of a metric ton of lard , this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks
both of my boys love this book and request it over and over again it is such a fun book to read because the children interact with the reader by answering the questions love it !
the shaman 's apprentice presents more information about the relationship between people and nature than many much larger volumes the story of kamanya , gabriela , and the shaman nahtahlah , educates children about the important roles of all living things the text is supported by rich and colorful illustrations which easily maintains the interest of children from four to 14 if you want the children in your life to understand the importance of rain forests and the need to preserve them , you must have this book
john gunther 's inside u s a comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get , hurling us back to the america of 1947 , as he explores , state by state , the people , politics , issues , passions and fads that make up our country written with great energy and insight , gunther captures an america justly proud of its wwii success , still unsure of its role in the world , and populated by fascinating characters like mayor laguardia of new york , governor saltonstall of massachusetts and boss hague of jersey city gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today he captures aspects of america that are gone , l never to return \( an industrial nation based on coal , iron ore and steel \) and he foresees issues that dog america to this day the negro problem \( actually , the white problem quot \) he condemns the segregationist society he finds in america , so inconsistent with its lofty ideals as you can tell , i loved this book it 's very hefty but every time you are about to put it down , gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading all this said , gunther does concentrate on the \( a \) historical , \( b \) political and \( c \) economic side of things you wo n't find much here about the arts or science but it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly
this is the sixth and final addition to the author 's excellent holiday time series , just in time for rosh hashanah ! as in the other titles , \( it 's challah time ! it 's seder time ! etc \) tod cohen 's full color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes , making jewish new year 's cards for their families , tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits , and blowing the shofar the sounds of the shofar are explained in easy , understandable terms for this young age level the children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names the brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre schoolers , their parents , and in the classroom included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about rosh hashanah recommended for all jewish libraries ages 4 6 reviewed by andrea davidso
pretty much all of the todd parr books we 've read are great but the peace book and the family book are by far our favorites they are very positive and carry a theme of tolerance we 'd highly recommend this book !
i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 , then it was a mere idea from that time on , until august 20th 2002 , i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover , patriot that he is , but also a flag i loved it , could n't be more happy
time was when the words betty crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks , although the books' recipes , for better or for worse , were always a product of their times the very first betty crocker picture cook book was published in 1950 \( still available \) , revolutionized how cookbooks were produced , and was an enormous best seller the recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company 's kitchens and in homes across america this was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages this gradually changed as betty and her books became more and more of a shill for general mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company 's bottom line , but to the detriment of good cooking
the cover of this book declares that you 'll learn ten simple truths that lead to an amazing life if your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to eat , drink , and be merry , then perhaps you 'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book alfred e neuman , of mad magazine , with his declaration of what , me \? worry \? provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by ms laroche if you 're looking for some deeper meaning to life , to success , to accomplishment , you 'd be much better served by reading napoleon hill , anthony robbins , dr covey , denis waitley , or brian tracey
most of the information is very theoritical and limited author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her in a nutshell , the message is that a dysfunctional mother 'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter \( s \) , and in turn , the daughter \( s \) may pass that onto her offspring \( s \)
on the one hand , i loved the book , since i am a big fan of thomas paine however , my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of the age of reason when they get the printing and or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books , they should remove this review at that point , i will eagerly buy a new copy
i was not a huge fan of the first book , but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book this may not be the case here while it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first , it is has it 's moments of unbeleiveablity how can dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him , and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him \? the only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister , and i kind of think it might be only a matter of time i also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission are they going to introduce a new character to be on to him every book \? this is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages
i am agreeing to the comment of e for effort on this book
i look for books all the time on this topic to see if there any new moves i can pick up to help shape and tone the stomach area which is a problem for most of us i think if you are just starting out this book will help you understand the positions you need to get into but it 's going to take alot more than 8 minutes to get results and i have been training for years
there is no doubt in my mind that josh harris is a good person , who sincerely wants to help people , particularly young christian women , who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene however , he does n't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular either he 's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant inexcusable in either case , considering how influential this book has become
in addition to the errors listed by others , i see missing letters in the middle of words , quote marks that are the wrong style \( backticks instead of curly quotes , done inconsistently \) , inconsistent indentations it 's a typesetting nightmare big disappointment
i found this book embarrassing to read not because it 's risque , but because it so clearly illustrates how the french italians got their reputations as great lovers is this the best that english literature can give us \? this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality
this bool from the evil russian is useless if you already own
lets say you were reading a book on the mafia , written by john gotti , or perhaps some lesser known mobster and there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and it 's activities furthermore , anyone who opposed the mafia and it 's activities was labeled an extremist and in the text , their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like ku klux klan , racist , bigoted , or paranoid , you 'd begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased , would n't you \?
the most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content , but , based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers , that most people actually believe this drivel how can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill informed \? the answer is that we cannot i will not bother to go through a detailed criticism , not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it , but because , in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in , no one would believe it today , the truth depends much more on one 's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence
the cover claims that the book has been revised and updated for the digital age , but winston 's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated the term , pda , does not even appear in the index
i approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions i did my best to like it , to find some secret meaning , some redeeming quality within , to no avail actually finishing the book was an accomplishment , in my opinion ultimately i found the book aimless , soulless , and the promoter of everything negative about the human species i know this sounds harsh , but time after time i felt let down by on the road
i was disapointed when i downloaded it and got 8 pages
this guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories
i devoured all of this writer 's books when i first discovered them and it had been quite some time since then when i bought this book i'm a real sucker for a book with dogs so i dove right in only to become disappointed all too quickly i did n't remember all the rambling it is rampant ! at times it was almost like reading a text book for all the 'skimming' that i did i ca n't say it was a waste of time but some more editing would be appreciated
i am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here simply put , this is the single worst novel i have ever read everything about it the writing , the characters , the story is godawful here follows an absolutely true story while i was forcing myself to read this drivel , i went out on date she and i were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it i was advocating the 25 page litmus , and she insisted on at least fifty she did several long train commutes a week to and from work , and so read a lot of novels anyway , i started describing this book she recognized it immediately , and interrupted me saying , the bear went over the mountain ! do n't read another word ! if you think it 's bad now , it only gets worse , if you can believe it ! quot she was right if you feel the need to find out for yourself , save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library
joseph nye keeps repeating himself multilateralism by global american charm attack that is simply a stupid assumption and it is untrue of american history in foreign relations nye still owes some answers to european scholars of international relations who criticized his idea in fact that is no personal multilateral approach
i found the book thought provoking , but there is more to philosophy than provocation the common underlying argument of this book , and its only valid statement as ethics , is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior , the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in this results oriented approach is all very well , but singer does n't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument virtually all of singer 's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept if you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument if you do n't accept the premise , its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion in short , these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline how useful you find this is up to you i personally do n't know singer from adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before i picked up the book as a result , i have trouble seeing what people are so excited about
this book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 2006 most of which are inacurate his boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions \( dow over 40 , 000 \) presented in this book
i originally wrote a review of this book in 1999 , titled this is a racist book disguised as a work of art it seems that i did n't explain well enough my objection to styron 's co opting of the story of a real human being , nat turner , whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book , the confessions of nat turner , by t r gray not only did styron steal the title of gray 's book , in which gray recounts his interview with the real nat turner , but the incidents styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern bred racism
i really love amanda quick , but this one just did n't work we do n't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together the action starts after they 've already spent a week getting to know each other very disappointing from a romance novel
the notion of interpretive communities is at best derivative of kuhn 's classical work , the structure of scientific revolutions , and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony
like others , i picked this book up after reading several in the no 1 ladies series no comparison
this novel of a 17th century samurai 's odyssey to europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way , but towards the end , endo does get in a few good points the style is somewhat pedantic and staid , but easy to read it 's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces the historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut and pastes from history textbooks i must admit i am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here i can only conclude that a lot of people who do n't really have much experience of japan , think they 've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly westernized piece of writing by a japanesese christian remember , not every japanese woman is a geisha , and not every japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai 's sword
it took me a year to finally complete this book and honestly , the only reason i completed it was because i had nothing else on my bookshelf to read this book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end what a waste of such a beautiful book cover do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money
the book had so much promise , but i find it to be disappointing in several ways , alas the recipes i 've tried have been delicious , and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative , although the discussions and instructions do n't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool , as would , for example , anything by julia child , marcella hazan , jacques pepin , or any of the king arthur flour baking cookbooks , all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes in this case , i was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before i bought the book were i a tyro , i do n't think this book would be the best introduction , although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying
this is like teen love fiction , and by that i mean it 's like a teenager wrote it , one who uses bad detail , cliche phrases , overused idioms , bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot
do n't buy this book if you do not have to for a class i did as with most textbooks , it is a ripoff mankiw got a 1 4 million million dollar advance for it who do you think pays that
you think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond , but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead i love konstatinos' other books , but this one left a bad taste in my mouth
dr freeman 's justly esteemed lee 's lieutenants a three volume work still stands \( despite the discovery of materials unavailable to dr freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s \) as the baseline for any study of the army of northern virginia the cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise , offered here , throws out two of every three words dr freeman wrote to allow for a one volume abridgement for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books
this is probably one of the hardest books i have ever read with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics , much of what hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible i also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being post human quot if you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition , with links to literature , read this if you do n't really care about the post human , skip it
i have to agree with stephen haines this guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink he makes boehme a gnostic , the troubadors , the knights templar , william blake , the masons , jung , and finally , any physicist worth his salt
this book deserves no stars
i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver , i knew the rest of the story it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing the story 's decent the text flows nicely , and the suspension of disbelief is strong , but where did nick 's originality go \? where 's the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook , a walk to remember , and nights in rodanthe \? it seems like he 's run out of steam , or did n't care too much about this one
i'm a long time fan of the anna pigeon mysteries , and have read all the others unfortunately , hard truth does not live up to the quality of ms barr 's earlier works it feels very contrived it also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups this book just does not meet the expectations i 've come to expect from the series
i 've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before , and have always been very pleased , but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth lp was the only guide we purchased , based on our previous experiences with them , but we had the chance to peruse others in the b b 's we stayed in throughout our trip of all of them , i 'd rate the lp as the 2nd best for our interests as they say , individual experiences may vary ! ireland has become a very expen ive tourist destination , so upon reflection , we would have been happier with the rough guide lp has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up short changing all of them in the process i hate to say it , but i 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best i 'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though
this is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message it should have been tiltled the jewish mother tree or something so the message was use me and use me and use me some more and after i'm all used up , use me some more and i will be happy thats something we want to convey to children
much of this book is very one sided in particular the sections on the environment are distorted and now known to be incorrect the book would be much better if they had not shown their bias
ayelet waldman is a graduate of harvard law school , so i assume she 's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer she should stick to what she knows the fact that she 's married to a famous author does n't make her a writer her novel is poorly written , overly sentimental and , to put it bluntly , very dumb
i had read a book about the french and indian war , one about the revolution and also the recent best seller , 1776 i found the war that forged a nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in american history i would highly recommend it very readable
there is n't much i can add to previous reviews of civilziation and its discontents my own reaction \( after 2 cracks at it , one in college , and one post \) is one of bafflement and boredom with academic , convoluted language , freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers rousseau , for example his psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works therefore , the redeeming value is found , perhaps , in freud 's closing passages , eery portends of europe 's ugly years
unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone very dull indeed but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it 's story time and she 's a preschool teacher
if you look at the march 2004 issue of the international association of bloodstain pattern analysts , you 'll find a very negative review of this book given that the reviewer \( herbert leon macdonell , the director of laboratory of forensic science bloodstain institute of corning , new york \) and all members of iabpa actively work in the field of forensics , i 'd take their word for it here 's an excerpt from the review , which can be found on the web at http www iabpa org march2004news pdf
first , i am a very open minded person , raised by a hippy biker family i really expected to identify with this book while i appreciate the what ina may 's movement accomplished during its time , i felt like the book was almost a joke verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community a community of people living on old school buses in the woods , delivering each other 's babies
i am soooo tired of danielle steel 's books they have lost all of the originality with which she used to write every book now has the same story line just different names for the characters boring ! what happened to the good stuff thurston house , ghost , kaliedescope
there is no measure how harmful and disastrous this sermon has been to all who have read or heard it the teaching of hell or everlasting damnation \( eternal torment \) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of christianity over 1800 years ago the first century church never believed in a hell the theory of hell was brought in by converts to christianity from pagan religions of the world hell was embraced by the political religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and converting effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as orthodox centuries after the resurrection of christ our english translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact , when it is actually fiction mostly all english versions except the concordant literal new testament and young 's literal propagate this fallacy
sometimes i 've enjoyed books by david baldacci \( wish you well
this book belongs in the fantasy section of the library
never received the book , so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost i have incurred
the most disappointing thing about the news from paraguay is the beginning , and not precisely because is a bad one , but because in the first chapters of lily tuck national prize awarded novel , there 's a hint that could have been better than it turn out to be
this is one of the few books so bad that i could n't finish it there is no explanation of how things work , or in many cases what they really are i feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed , sex , or guilt about greed and sex do not bother with this book
throughout my read , my head kept shaking with disappointment if the renaissance of hard sf relies on stories a full decade , even two decades , old , then the genre 's future is feebly fixated on its past not to say that some of the stories here are n't wonderful emphasis on some quot but dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard sf fails to deliver on the title 's promise this is more nostalgia than renewal , and you should read a library borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past passing but do n't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into sci fi 's future
the book is written about an empire in the future i'm not really sure why asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer , which is a dying system of government , instead of a democratic republic i know this is nit picking , but i did n't like this book
my name is big samad sefiane , i have been writing screenplays and making music since the age of 13 the only problem with that
while this book put together by the detroit free press has action photos , they are some of the most disappointing pictures i 've ever seen in a book about a team 's season where are the photos of tiger players actually hitting a baseball \? if you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne , talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles , then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself , be prepared to be frustrated i much preferred the photograhy in the george cantor paperback out of nowhere the detroit tigers' magical 2006 season i know that this volume covers the play offs and world series whereas the cantor book does n't , but it 's photo collection is poor , the photos in the cantor book are superb if you are a tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much , \( the writing and articles are quite good at least \) but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc very disappointing , worth only 2 stars
edward said , created a proble and made a career of the israel palestine conflict , and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the arab palestinians he was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry , linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti israel and anti jewish hatred on every university he spoke at hopefully , this vintage book will become no longer relevant , ans disappear
can anyone tell me if the book words on the vine has an answer key with it \? thanks sgra
the only thing this book is good for is getting high with your friends then reading the dialogue aloud the thought that anyone actually believes or takes the situations in this crap serious is so befuddling it 's scary this is nothing more than propaganda for some strange religious cult i do n't know about you but if i'm going to buy a book to help me with my kids it 's going to be by an expert , not some failed fiction writer
i 've read five of the nine temperance brennan mysteries that kathy reichs has published , but this is my least favorite i lost interest about two thirds through i felt the villains were not fleshed out , the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely , the ending too neatly contrived , and the personal romantic side story too awkward this one was also too long , by about 50 pages reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients , yet they did not blend into a successful flavor the other four of her novels were fine i love the tv series as well , although bones allegedly shows dr brennan much earlier in her career , with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books in the tv series , dr brennan has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly in the books , her lesser characters all seem lesser , indeed better luck next time out , dr reichs
first off , so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor , imagine a junior high school student acting big to impress his friends with jokes , that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book it is filler the illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low just more filler finally , all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of ps , or at worst a few internet searches i think this book is over priced and i wish i could return it caveat emptor
if tess is going to continue to write books like this , she should switch her publisher to harlequin romance , it will give the unsuspecting buyer a heads up
totally disappointing from the beginning the novel read well , but like a sherlock holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue i , personally , do not like reading this type of mystery i want clues alas , there were none also , the characters did not make sense most were too undeveloped mr patterson needs to go back to the drawing board try to forget the he is being paid up front by the publisher
i wish i could have back the numerous tedious hours slogging through white noise to the bitter , bitter end not since jane smiley 's moo has such a dull tome been written aobut , among other things , ameican academia little happens of note no one cares about the cardboard characters someone gets shot in the belly , for no good reason and yet this is fawnedover as a comic masterpiece by , among others , the new york times i ahve been told to read white noise before i picked up underworld have no fear i 'll undergo root canal without novocain before i try that one on for size i 've been reading nothing but plumber 's trade journals and german magazines just to try to get the taste of this novel out of my mouth for the past few days i'm thinking of getting the definitive curious george collection just so i do n't have to read any words at least that guy in the big yellow hat knew enough to keep his mouth shut , unlike that noncompoop jack gladney and his boring friends if people prersist in thinking this is great literature , i suggest giving up reading altogether
i did n't find the book too bad but it has no ending did he leave out the last chapter \? i have always liked his books so hopefully he 's got this out of his system
pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought he mistakes child abuse for some form of real child rearing i just read his interview in the guardian uk although it has been years since i have read this book , it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when i think about it i have read philosophy from classic to contemporary i have lived in japan and practiced zen archery and zen meditation this book has only incorrect views of western and eastern philosophy yet pirgsig , to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon this is proof that pirsig remains deranged moreover , in the guardian uk interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son 's murder pirsig is a perfect example of someone with narcisstic personality disorder pirsig 's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and or capitulating mother
the premise of the store is interesting how did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football \? the first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons \( west coast offense , lt , etc \)
i love linda howard books i always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least i think the characters are not developed well , and the relationship between cal and cate occurred too fast the story was rushed and i'm sure linda could have done much better writing on this book
this is a liberal 's study bible the study notes show the best 'modern' scholarship , which doubts moses wrote the first 5 books of the bible doubts the authorship of most of paul 's epistles even doubts that the beloved disciple john wrote the gospel of john
i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president \( ! \) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too
to say christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world purely craziness christianity will live as long as the world exists what is died is the faith for many christians , what has been changed is our faith \( by money , pride , and selfishness \) and consequently , our church and our societies
bill o'reilly has a good reason for his massive paranoia somewhere , deep in the recesses of his brain , he knows something 's wrong only he 's got it backwards the secular progressives are doing just fine , but he 's the one with the serious problem here 's a guy who had to pay millions of bucks to settle a sexual harassment suit yet , he 's proclaiming himself the arbiter of the correct , traditional point of view only in an era of the stupid , undereducated and witless would bill o'reilly have a modest role to play save your money
i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant heavy , top 5 bschool this text was recommended for my intro cap markets class \( although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class \)
very disappointing and boring ! no likeable characters , very uninteresting story could would not finish too many better books waiting
i have enjoyed the miss julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite
col mike martin raised in iraq , speaks fluent arabic
do n't make the mistake of judging the entire hard case crime series by this lackluster entry
pros 1 john corey is still a funny , memorable character
clarke 's glaring research error author of the prophet , kahlil gibran \( 1883 1931 \) , in an article titled the new frontier wrote are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what can you do for your country \? clarke sure missed this one , as have so many before him did kennedy just paraphrase , or did he plagarize \? i would have liked to have seen clarke deal with this sticky issue
i was so excited when i initially bought this book and honestly , when i read it i was disappointed i thought it was a bit dry and boring to read through , despite the useful tips although the authors try hard , they really do n't convey the spirit and fun that college life has to offer
while i found this book interesting and informative when it dwelled upon the personalities and contributions of the physicists who discovered and explored the field of quantum mechanics prior to ww2 , i found two problems with the book as it entered the war first , it spent too much time , at least for me , on the details of minor episodes and players in this sense , i might have appreciated the treatment had i been a scholar researching the field but i was n't hence , i often found the reading dull second , i found powers' ultimate thesis that heisenberg purposefully delayed the german atomic bomb program unpersuasive it appeared to me that powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis for example , when reviewing heisenberg 's farm hall statement in august 1945 that two tons of u235 was required to make an atomic bomb , powers suggests that because heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later , and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football , his two ton statement was a purposeful error equally persuasive , if not more , is the simple thought that heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required , thereby prompting him to tell speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical this is not to say that powers is necessarily wrong i simply believe that based on the facts he presents , the issue remains debatable
this is not what i expected or wanted the book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature the description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use
i know h james is considered one of the greats of american literature and i question my taste for hating most of his writing with few exceptions i think he is a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism i read wings of the dove many years ago in the days when i would not allow myself to set aside books i did not enjoy i recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why i disliked him so much now in my old age i had no pangs of conscience when i happily closed the book before finishing it if more of the stories had been like daisy miller i would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of wings i am currently seeking relief from henry 's turgid prose by reading hemingway i 'd trade in a henry for an ernie any day it 's also difficult to like mr james' snobbish , shallow and unsympathetic characters the more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style
earlier this year i reviewed what many will see as the companion volume to this book \( photoshop blending modes cookbook for digital photographers \) , written by the same author unfortunately , the newer publication is less useful it seems to have been written on a pretext that it 's clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do this seems from my own personal viewpoint to be greatly undervaluing the power of photoshop \( and similar software \) practitioners of digital fine art should \( really , constructively \) be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain
this book is not worth wasting your money on the techniques that are represented look ok to the untrained eye , but if you examine them closely , you will notice many mistakes the techniques are sparse , one per angle they are also demonstrated with poor posture and attack to the novice , this book may appear to represent the art of cabales serrada escrima , but it does not more than half of the book is unrelated to the system of serrada this book does nothing to show the effectiveness of cabales serrada escrima
the monographs lack any sort of scientific references a true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made
ultimately the ending was so outrageous that it took away from the rest of the story i would not recommend it to anyone for that reason i 've already given my copy away
i was more than willing to give none dare call it treason a chance , as i found the scale of stormer 's research impressive however , the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive communist takeover in america came to pass , coupled with his outspoken admiration for mccarthy and truly insane predictions like this
if the author 's misuse of the apostrophe in the title is any indication of how they wrote the rest of the book , i would stay away
i recently picked up a copy of mage the awakening not knowing quite what to expect since ars magica i 've loved mage from gurps i quickly switched over to white wolf 's editions of mage the ascension , finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today
white wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing they did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they 've ever been
i bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling look at the picture of the forever cool ms mathieson
this is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor the book traces the history of the knights templar and their supposed transformation into free masons much of the discussion focuses on free masonry , including its role in the american revolution i found the factual support lacking and the prose quite uninspired
krakauer is highly confused and i can tell that so are some of these reviewers he cannot give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself the church he is talking about is completley separate from the church of jesus christ of latter day saints jon krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that do n't believe that their assumptions were correct
coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project i would have to say that this book is kind of boring if your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book but if you 're going to read it just to read it , then i would suggest you not i have to admit , that some of the stuff richard feynman says is funny but i found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness do n't get me wrong , i really do admire mr feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok sometimes he got into a lot of in depth physics stuff that i just did n't care for but sometimes i was interested in what he was saying
elizabeth george , please come back this book examines in sickening detail the events preceding the murder of our lovely helen i , for one , do n't care i get it we all got it the last time it 's been a long time since i have abandoned any book after a few chapters , and this book truly deserves to be put down in every sense do n't buy it
i had read such glowing reviews of this book , and had enjoyed other creamer works so thoroughly that i was suprised how uninspired i was while reading this perhaps i failed to be dazzled by stengel the man perhaps i grew tired of the predictable retelling of stengel 's life , season by season , many of which held no remarkable events baseball in '41 is a much more rewarding book , full of wonderful anecdotes well recounted
i enjoyed the plot and the characters it was very funny but there were too many grammar mistakes in the book , which i found too irritating and distracted from the book some conversations did not flow logically one person would answer herself , which did n't make sense also , the author switches from 1st person to 3rd person with the character of nickel and she used 'to' instead of 'too ' as a former copy editor and english major , this was very distracting ! but overall , a great book i plan on getting the next 2
i did n't care for this book at all i think it is a very well written book , for teachers , but not for a parent who is transracially adopting a child i was looking for a book on how i would parent an african american child and this book was more of a textbook i think it is very misleading to have it labeled as a must read for parents and teachers and it should be advertised as a book for teachers i thought inside their voices was much more informative about the experiences of a transracially adopted child
why \? because i was expectin something else , but first of all , i did n't expect that you have to open make a hole in your robosapiens to modify it , so forget it ! i will not damage my robot
i was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book after that it seemed that little new information was added , or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition there were so many different characters , and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news the structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on tv
just bought a rotisserie and was hoping to find how to use it and good recipes only found about 4 or 5 i would 've liken to know different types of meat you could cook in it and for how long you cook it for
mailer tells us a lot we do n't want to know about it 's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer 's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier he gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he does n't know about all the negative aspects of his persona are laid out still , it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them or else he needed the money truth sells , even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book , and quite un useful it should have been titled me and my books , some thoughts on me and my writing
i 've read some of the other reviews , and i could n't disagree more this book is not a page turner i found myself skipping over whole sections of prose because they were boring and sometimes needless the story is straighforward hardly any surprises hardly any twists or turns bad guys are always bad guys good guys are always good guys there 's no hidden agenda lurking through the story the blue rose is a natural anomaly the people who really want it the people willing to steal and kill for it are conveniently identified as people willing to steal and kill for the blue rose there 's no mystery here really it 's just a matter of getting to the end of the book
after trying 2 recipes , i thought that i was a pretty bad cook so , i asked my friend , a very good cook , to try a couple more recipes she had the same results disgusting ! ! these recipes must not have been kitchen tested mine as well just boil some chicken and dump a can of cream of mushroom soup on top the results would be better stay away
i held great hopes for this book duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country however , secrest in her drive to capture the essence of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight to say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement but worse than that are the inaccuracies , especially when she writes about duveen 's customers just for starters , apparently she did n't recognize the need to differentiate between john d rockefeller , jr and his father \( or maybe she did n't know there has been more than one jdr ! \) you wo n't learn much from this tome that you do n't know to begin , and getting through it will be a struggle
the original julie and romeo was delightful this book was utter nonsense a great disapointment finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along it did n't
after some years in the ic design business \( mostly analog \) i needed to teach a course on asicss this book was the text specified by my predecessor i did not like the book , and eventually read the weste and harris book in its 3rd edition wolf is not nearly as clear , complete and logically organized as weste and harris no comparison
the book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again so you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea it seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas \( come on , man , if you have 10 pages of good ideas , give them to me in 10 \) but then again i guess most books in this genre make you do that sheesh
if your into hendrix enough to want to find out more about electric ladyland , your probably already going to know everything in this book if you 've read such great hendrix books such as 'electric gypsy' then you wo n't get much from this book other than information obtained that you 've read before from 'electric gypsy' coloured in this authors opinion on jimi 's music
this is by far one of the least helpful parenting books i have read i used numerous suggestions in this book and none of them proved to be effective using my own judgment and keeping calm with a positive attitude toward my toddler proved to be more effective then anything mentioned here his suggestions for head banging are completely stupid and made my toddler bang her head harder during a tantrum not recommended
the book starts out captivating then it suddenly shifts to elkinks views of painting , that are strongly bent to the favor of abstractionist elkinks thoughts on jackson pollocks creative energy is more than i wanted to know he devots almost an entire chapter to this already to small book , to his idol how pollock flicks his wrist to get the effect of splated paint just right and pollocks tourched stance over his works as the canvis is lying on the floor to much ! i do not recommend this little book
this book is bad for beginner and practically useless for a master there is no comprehensive description of training complexes , footwork drills and other important details , which were completely omitted it gives just an overview of the system in general , so the reader can have some vague feeling of what giron escrima is
i bought this book thinking that i would learn something new about the cosmetic industry not only did i not learn anything , i came away from the book wondering just how someone could 've accumulated all of that information without being able to present it in a better way
it is now more than a month after i was supposed to receive this book and i have not gotten it yet , what the hell is going on
2 stars for decent writing \( at least a decent translation \) , for an intriguing start , and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf that 's pretty much it negative stars aplenty for the protagonists coy and tanger \( i listened to nc on 13 endless tapes , so perhaps am misspelling their names \) the tortured metaphors they speak , think , and by which they and their insipid adventures are continually described , bore to tears aside from an occasional scrape between coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss , all of the action in nc clusters at the beginning \( promisingly so , i 'll grant \) and the end \( all wimper , no bang \) of this novel as a salty seadog once said \( no doubt anticipating this novel \) , ahoy matey , thar she blows !
the nautical chart could have been a better book if , its author had eliminated about 50 to 100 pages the story dragged i read it at night in bed and i kept falling asleep the book does have its merits the information regarding navigational instruments and history was interesting and was exciting at times the ending was good \( the best part of the book \) the relationship between the coy and tanger had shades of james caine and jim thompson even so , i would hestitate about recommending this novel
south by java head features fundamentals i find so promising a nautical adventure set in southeast asia during world war ii , written by a prominent screenwriter nonetheless , the story falls flat and i found it just barely compelling enough to finish the plot moves slowly , punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another , the descriptions of action are confusing , and the characters mere outlines devoid of development i hoped this book would be as good as a 1950 's nautical adventure i highly recommend , the wreck of the mary deare , but unfortunately java head is just disappointment for other se asia world war ii fiction , clavell 's king rat is also a good place to start
i read this book and hated it i was sorry i wasted my money normally , i would have donated the book ater reading it but , in this case i was so disappointed , i threw the book away after reading it i was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the us i was also disapponted in the oprah book club selection committee it seemed to me they found a story they liked , and that is where their critical thinking ended it was the only and last oprah book selection i ever bought after reading it , it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the oprah club had never been to western pa i am from western pa as is o'dell and this book lacks local color she either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale landscape is just not about dysfunctional families , eatnparks and religious statues in the yards people in that area of pa say ai n't , slippy , and youns this would be esp true for someone like the main character , harley \( there are people with college degrees from this area who still have color in their language \) o 'dell is no faulkner or caufield i find this lack of local flavor with a lot of modern authors unfortunately , our books are even becoming mcdonaldized there is nothing special about this book
although interesting , these are designs and concepts that are not practical in the real world but , if all you want are some pretty pictures
this book is not my favourite in the heartland series it is not even really about heartland , the main part of the book is based in occanumba
replicant alert ! avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie except for the last couple of pages , the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about post modernism you will be much better off buying the director 's cut on dvd , and watching it several times ! this series of books has its exceptions , this is not one of them unintentionally hilarious in parts , as only the academician can be pretentious , ponderous cinema scholar jargon that offers little of value or insight read sammon 's the making of blade runner instead ! \( nice cover , though
the message meant more to me than to my young children they didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box they think playing in cardboard boxes is fun , not a punishment for exercising too much freedom i could see using the book as a basis for discussion , but i think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents
the book was specific to one particular model of blackberry they should have that in the title it was of no use to me after five minutes , i set it aside to gather dust
i got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how coach k motivates his teams , organizes his practice sessions , and instills leadership qualities in his athletes what i got was a less than thrilling re hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter you 'd have to be a true blue devil fan to like this book i did n't , so i gave it to one of my co workers who graduated from duke he likes it
leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth \( e g he never actually studied hwa rang do he offered the lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history \) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book i 've ever seen try marinas' panandata , mark wiley , the presas brothers , leo giron or ray galang for stick stuff you 'll be much better off
i really expected more from coetzee , whom i had never read before picking up this book i saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes , and i'm not surprised the title character spends all of her time giving speeches , which is strange for a novel you think you will get a plot , but you just get lectured to the writing is good , spare and cogent , but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel , in my opinion the best chapter , which is the last , has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters
not the most exciting book out there but if you like minor league baseball , this book 's worth a quick read
i was disappointed greatly at the time i opened this book huge gaps between strings , lots of empty space on pages all this is for masking the simple fact this 200 pages book contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less and , more , these pages are filled with useless interviews \( who wants to read an interview instead of explanations \? ! \) and other empty words
i was not expecting this book to be a sunday afternoon photo shoot for reanactors it lacks reality and substance i returned this book out of disapointment seeing the same faces in every picture but in diffrent uniforms takes a lot away from this book however , the color photos were nice better luck next time but a a for effort
i'm a pretty diverse reader , so i decided to give this one a go it started out somewhat interesting , but then just sort of made me keep saying , okay what 's the point here \? i really like ninah , the main character , but i keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in i guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this , but i closed the book wondering , why did i read this \? i grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the punishments just ridiculous i'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions , but this was just way out there for me ninah 's relationship with her nanna was the neatest one in the book i'm glad i'm finished now i can move on to something more fulfilling
i am a long time admirer of claire mcnab 's writing despite the fact i have been disappointed in the direction \( or lack of it \) in which she has taken the carol ashton mystery series although she is more known in the u s for her mystery and espionage books , her novel under the southern cross is a bang up , great romance delivered in her typically spare \( or is it stingy \? \) style i was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a 10 second sex scene thrown in but , when i got to the last line of this book i found myself closing it and thinking that i had once again been suckered by past memories of claire mcnab
having a plant nursery for 20 years i can tell you if this book is you only resource be in for a wild ride he states many places what has cause him the most problems , but no one starts a nursey the same and workable ideas would be better than the work he calls stressful and more important than growing plants our nursery is the opposite of stressful and has so many happy rewards never mention in this book very little help on selling and getting customers also
i was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book after that it seemed that little new information was added , or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition there were so many different characters , and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news the structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on tv
i'm a huge suz fan but i really think she missed the boat on this one her style has changed since she moved to hardcover this book just fell flat for me the secondary storyline or fbi agent jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple cosmo jane did n't like her at all cosmo lost his seal ness somewhere along the way not a re read for me
this book is simply an ego boost for the author i found absolutely nothing i could use in my own business , but was
a book on the theme of having the courage to deepen family ties that 's a good theme however , the author ca n't leave well enough alone he really goes after people without kids as though they all , regardless of their circumstances , remind him of his former self someone with too much cynicism and cowardice to raise a family even though that 's obviously the only way to become a complete person
i bought this book because \( if i recall correctly \) it was long listed for last years manbooker prize and also , \( this i recall \) because it had good reviews here on amazon anyway , i was real disappointed i quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later i found the contrasting aspects of the father 's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality character of aunt , cousin , priest , mom etc etc also grew gratingly perfect this may be excessive , but after a while i felt like i was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel the comparisons with god of small things are seriously unflattering to roy 's great book comparisons with \( the overrated \) memoirs of a geisha or \( also not finished \) one thousand chestnut trees would have been more appropriate
this book deals with some fairly rediculous topics i'm not into mysticism or talisman 's or that stuff , so perhaps i am biased
why someone would chose these books is beyond me , especially when there are so many other good choices literature has an impact on people and the only impact i can imagine junie having on others is negative
i agree with some of the negative reviews that the junie b jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable my son , who is a pretty sensitive boy , did n't like junie b jones because he thought she was rude i would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who , though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes , are generally nice people we did love the magic tree house series , both for the adventure and the personalities of jack and annie
i own perhaps 20 books on the bird 's and this is one of the worse mostly because the material is so poorly organized no real attempt is made to sort through the \( admittedly tangled \) move orders motifs variations in this opening also , the author seems to have a 'bad attitude' even though he plays the opening and has several examples in the book the section on the leningrad dutch reversed is better than the others but still lifeless
why is s douglas scotty slamming every car sales book on amazon but zig zigler 's \? do you work for ziggy or maybe a friend and pushing this book for him take a look at all of s douglas scotty reviews concerning car sales he puts almost everyone of them down but praises zigler 's book what 's up with that \?
this book does a good job of telling you what your ipaq can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it i wanted more information about how to set up my ipaq to connect with the internet the book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was , but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work
up to the minute \? \? \?
i remove children from abusive parents daily
the book mentions mannatech \( notice the manna \? \) and its product ambrotose snake oil , sugar pills ! not backed by scientific studies all claims are anecdotal , i e , are faith based mannatech products are peddled to the hopeful , the desperate , the last chance for me 's , and so this is not only doing a disservice to others , but is preying on people 's weakness the company is set up like other pyradmid schemed companies , using associates to pump its sugar pills , costing consumers a lot of money folks , there is no instant solution in a pill the associates make claims for cleft lip , down syndrome , obesity , all the terrible things human beings must bear in this world , and offer a pill made up of sugar to combat what is essentially a natural , human state in new zealand and australia , the govts are looking into mannatech beware ! the sugar pill recipe came in an inspiring moment to a scientist when in prayer to god excuse me , but while i believe in the power of prayer , i do not believe god drops manna pills from heaven god expects us to do our work , namely , do n't overeat , live with that cleft lip , get some exercise , eat your vegetables and fruits , read good literature and enjoy the sunlight
it 's no wonder that people look at me strangely when i explain a great love of history to them it 's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student if this book were more widely circulated , the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced i have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make it so boring that i would literally fall asleep reading it
i do n't understand why anyone would publish a book anymore with black and white illustrations i know this is supposed to be a classic and all that so it 's my own fault for not checking when i read the description i do n't even know why i'm keeping it i 'll never read it you have to wade through tons of technical jargon and lengthy chapters that would be much better served by some large color photographs maybe that makes me shallow , i do n't know , but there are much more 'complete guides' out there on this topic these days
i was seduced by the sinister cover and the synopsis on the inside cover into thinking this was going to be a chilling account account my foot ! i gingerly turned the first page and instantly drowned in wave after wave of details as if the rough draft was a series of scraps stapled together and mailed off to an impatient publishe
the 20 you need to know this book is poorly written , and the author would do well to use the 80 20 principle in his writing
anyone who knows me would tell you i truly enjoy reading i am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours it took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book the story just could not keep my interest i felt no real affinity to any of the characters i have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters she writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more in the case of this novel i just did n't feel it her other novels will not leave you dissapointed ugly ways is not a good example of the ansa 's true talent as a writer if you have not done so try her other novels i guarantee you will come away wanting to read more
the subtitle to this review should have been glaring inconsistencies outright fantasies i 've found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely for example , on page 7 coleman says the club of rome was established in 1968 , but on page 17 he suggests that the club of rome played a key role in the cuban missile crisis and attempted to sell its 'crisis management' progam to president kennedy unless we 've been misled , the cuban missile crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded what are careful readers to make of such a passage \? either it 's a typo and he means 1958 , or , as i heartily suspect , he does n't have a grasp on his subject on page 9 coleman suggests henry kissinger 's role in destabilizing the united states by three wars , the middle east , korea , and vietnam is well known however , kissinger , working at harvard from 1948 , had no role in the u s government until the 1960 's , working for the kennedy administration the korean war , as we are all aware , occured in 1950 , and ended long before kissinger had any influence on american foreign policy if it were true that kissinger had an influence on the united states' policy in korea , for example , then coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text however , he only leaves us with the cryptic is well known it is definitely not well known , and coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true
it would take a book to answer all that is wrong with farrell 's reasoning , but to make a few points
this is book was on the new york best seller 's list because it 's about new york , not because it 's well written or even interesting you run across a few gems throughout the book , but you have to be patient to get to them i hate to buy , start and not finish a book it seems like such as waste i 'd gladly skip the book if i had to do it over again
this was expected a fanatic relativist dismembers absolutist views into little irrelevant pieces our civilization has been jumping between absolutism universalism and relativism ever since its decline , with only a few people realizing a third alternative with this whole book based on a flawed definition , it is a pointless and utterly tedious read
first off , i have not read this book myself , so disreguard this review if you want i'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what i can tell here , and from descriptions from my own mother , i believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty train me i am 99 sure , but she does not remember the title so i ca n't be 100 sure
as i was reading this book , i came across many poems that were far too sexually explicit for my taste , to name a few the first , early images of heaven and full summer i found these poems to be highly offensive , and improper for the general audience
i looked at the 2002 printing as well as this 2006 revised printing in order to see what has been updated and all the reviews are identical why \? which edition are people reviewing \? i think amazon is making a mistake by not alloting reviews properly
we have to do better than this for our children controlling and turning your kid into the perfect little , well behaved lemming is going to haunt you until you die this type of abuse never has a good , long term effect on anyone put the paddles and belts down and talk to your kids they deserve at least that much
you can tell i do n't pay attention to wall street journal or new york times i picked up david sacks' book from borders' linguistics stack because of the title i should have known better
the hero is a cold , mean brute who does not deserve his gentle wife kassia he should have been made to marry joanna the shrewish woman he was betrothed to i could n't get past graelam raping kassia , i really could n't i know this is medieval england and women were more or less treated like chattel , but come on kassia is a gentle sweet girl who does everything to please this philandering , brute of a man he sleeps with one of the servants after he marries kassia , when she confronts him he threatens to beat and rape her which he had already done \( i shuddered again right there \) there 's not one but two women undermining kassia 's authority and she sits back and takes this , please ! the servants and his own soldiers abhor his treatment of kassia throughout the book i prayed for her to runaway with dienwald or for guy to fall in love with her and take her away from graelam the women who made kassialife hell were rewarded for their treatment of her , they are never made to pay for what they did to her which is another thing that put me off this book i like to see the heroine giving as good as she gets even if she 's not a particularly strong character kassia was far too soft and gentle for this brute as a result he walked all over her quite literally i wanted him to really suffer for his treatment of her which he did n't , this is why i bothered to finish this book for him to get his comeuppance which hedid n't she capitulated far too easily in the end when he came to get her at her father 's castle i know that he 's a warrior but did n't knights have a chivalric code
pinching a child 's trapezius muscle \? hitting him or her with a belt or a stick hard enough for it to hurt \? james dobson should be put away
dobson has this to say about the supposed 'strong willed child' even in infancy , he fairly bristles when his dinner is late and he insists that someone hold him during every waking hour later , during toddlerhood , he declares total war on all forms of authority his greatest thrill comes from drawing on the walls and flushing kitties down the toilet the strong willed child has a rampaging will
i wanted to be interested in this book , but it became pretty boring ater a while there is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose he claims to be neutral , yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship although the author claims to be in recovery , i did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives i felt that his narrative was self serving , and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation there is a price to pay what was good was hearing his father 's take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded that was interesting i'm getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960 's , 70 's and 80 's were i did n't like his picture either
my brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my dad 's side of the family he had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on accutane having heard bad things about the side effects , my dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication he faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever some of the ideas in the book are absurd as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne , i can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous when i was a teenager , i 'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible , and i got through high school with only the occasional zit i 've read that for a small number of people , diet can be a factor for acne , but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause \( this assumes you eat reasonably well malnutrition is n't sexy \) since medication should always be a last resort , a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes , but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere for the curious , while my brother had some strong side effects from the accutane \( none dangerous , primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes \) , it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin
this is a fine series so when i began this volume i had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others ms haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the texture of everyday life in imperial rome \( at the time of vespasian and titus in this one \) the dialogue and the characters are both engaging so what went wrong \? a young girl appears to speak with falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her and away we go , on and on and on ! i was weary by the time i got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful the length of this book \( 326 pages \) really cannot support so thin a story i was left wondering what had happened and if somehow i had missed something as there was so little going on
very disappointed with it was expecting something groundbreaking , but it failed to deliever an easy read and quite honestly , boring
i am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review that is pretty pathetic this book was written with no rhyme or reason there is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all one star is stretch plus , i am asian , and it was still hard for me that is when you know it is bad
this book , by the way , was published in 1988 , not 1998 as the notes above indicate it is also reflected in the books theme and attitude
i have read this book only once time , it tooks me about 1 hour , it is very basic , have not any important info , else that you can get from a free catalo
first a little background i'm 53 with a preteen son i'm not quite a luddite i make my living from an online business that i own and operate our big present to our son last xmas was a computer one he and i were going to build from scratch the main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work we gave our son a budget \( not big by gamer pc standards \) to shop for the parts
unfortunately , sidney wolfe and the whole worst pills business enterprise is riding on the reputation of public citizen as a champion for consumers , but has failed to live up to it with this guide in some cases , warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports , but rather , are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves hardly an unbiased , consumer oriented source of information consider as one example the book 's do not use warning regarding the prescription drug , armour thyroid rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation \( because there isn't any research \) , the guide instead quotes the ama and the american thyroid association , two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put armour a far less expensive drug out of business if this is the sort of unbiased information you want about the drugs you take , you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets if millions of thyroid patients taking armour thyroid were to follow the advice in worst pills , the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health i definitely do not recommend this book in any way mary j shomon , thyroid patient advocate and autho
i read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it a re read twenty years later gave me a different perspective macleans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best there are also a few glaring errors that i am surprised that his editor did not pick up on , two of note shaffer \( supposedly from montana \) is credited with a mid west accent \? \? montana is far west not 'mid' west secondly , nazi helicopters \? this is just plain sloppy maclean should have known much better
dobson has it wrong children 's susceptibility to god and the attributes of god has to do with rearing them with the love of god in their hearts from the beginning , praying and relying on god , and being taught to please god violence begets violence to spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator 's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional , physical and spiritual evolution of children ignorance begets ignorance , and if you 're in charge of children , feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child
i agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines , that was something like just ok , not great quot i 've been working w server 2003 for a while now , and from my work experience , i knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage i would read each chapter , read the summaries , take all the practice questions , and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what i 'd face on the exam unfortunately , i was right , and i just missed passing the exam this book is n't terrible , but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also
hank hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of israel is concerned he is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups , to include pretribulationists indeed , his scholarship is no scholarship at all it is pure propaganda to see real scholarship , get tim cohen 's materials \( see below \)
i found this book to be pretentiously over complexified the relationship between object and surface has been aptly documented by many other art historians of the late 20thc
this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything i did n't even like the story i would give this book a big fat zero if i could ! !
2 stars for decent writing \( at least a decent translation \) , for an intriguing start , and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf that 's pretty much it negative stars aplenty for the protagonists coy and tanger \( i listened to nc on 13 endless tapes , so perhaps am misspelling their names \) the tortured metaphors they speak , think , and by which they and their insipid adventures are continually described , bore to tears aside from an occasional scrape between coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss , all of the action in nc clusters at the beginning \( promisingly so , i 'll grant \) and the end \( all wimper , no bang \) of this novel as a salty seadog once said \( no doubt anticipating this novel \) , ahoy matey , thar she blows !
i hold martin 's song of ice and frie series in high regard the man is a talented writer for adults
this is a highly influential book roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency no one has had the same negative impact on roosevelt 's name to equal wyman 's attack but , although wyman , a professional historian has well documented his research , much of the indictment of the roosevelt administration is based upon conjecture incapable of proof the litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of auschwitz he asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of caring thousands of jews could have been saved but there is no way to prove this many jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate and jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria too much in his charges is based on too little evidence peter novick in his book , the holocaust in american life , calls wyman 's thesis a comfortable morality tale and bad history quot in addition to novick , henry l feingold , frank w brecher , and william rubinstein have written critically about wyman
cover blurb
i thought this book was a waste of my reading time i saw a review on the today show , and read several postive reviews as well , and it piqued my interest what i thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the coming changes challenges of a mother pre teen daughter relationship was a book about a mother seeming to tiptoe around her daughter 's emotional state what is sarah going to think about this , what is she going to say about that , etc \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that i applaud the time spent karen and sarah spent together something that should be done in all parent child relationships
but lana wood has a very autobiographical writing style i found wood 's memoir to be incredibly gossipy she speaks for pages upon pages about her own feelings during pivotal times in natalie 's life every here or there , it 's nice to have an eyewitness account of what happened at certain times , but i 'd rather read about the academy awards for which natalie was being nominated instead of the powerful men in hollywood with whom lana was sleeping there is a lot of name dropping as well as a lack of substance in the book 's context after reading this , i read suzanne finstad 's natasha and found it to be very thorough and much more detailed about both her personal and professional life i was not a fan of this book in any respect
i appreciate anyone 's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us however , i could see a hole in csikszentmihalyi 's attempt from the beginning
i was incredibly disappointed with this book purchase especially because i paid full price for it i have absolutely no use for it why \?
i must admit i usually write only positive reviews as i buy books very carefully this is unfortunately a wrong buy i like the shabby chic style and since she 's the person to get inspiration from on this style , i immediately bought this book without hesitation i must say i was n't inspired at all not even on one item and i am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag , browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market the pics are big but on flowers \? \? i think i should 've got the first book instead
i too eagerly anticipated reading this book , since i went through an apron sewing blitz this summer i was a bit disappointed , however although the photos and instructions are helpful \( for seamsters more accomplished than myself \) , the tone of the book is reactionary , with negative statements about working mothers and a lot of nostalgia for the ozzie and harriet era although geisel celebrates the rebirth of the domestic arts , she praises the home as nest \( enclave of traditional domesticity \) rather than the house as studio \( a diy workshop involving every member in open ended acts of engagement with economy , history , and culture \) still , there 's some interesting history and some great photos
this is not very good that is to say , the writing and the fluidity of gazzara 's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast
i found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities spend your money on days of knights and damsels by carlson
not recommended for native speakers of the english language
if i had been an editor and received deadly slipper ,
this book is very disappointing the writing is terrible and rather amateurish the writer bored me , maybe something 's lost in translation from french , i do n't know i already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book , although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work mara sounds stupid , immature and inconsistent skip this book , it 's not worth your time peter mayle 's mysteries set in france are way much better that this at least his novels have sense of humor , suspense , very interesting characters and most important , they are very well written
i was extremely disappointed by this book pamphlet , being misled by the other favorable reviews it is completely lacking in information it has 51 6 x8 pages with huge font and too many cartoons it successfully defines what is good and bad posture , but does not provide excercises to improve it \( it simply states to practice good posture \) there are much much better alternatives i have read posture alignment and recommend that , and have heard of great reviews for posture , get it straight !
this book is the typical package of business ideas the book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful in addition , there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work the author does state that what may be work for one person , may be play to another however , this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you do n't mind putting in the time or work the title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort , which is not the case for many of the ideas \( masonry , restauranteur for example \)

this was a defective unit got new unit and it works as expected
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord if you do n't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all
pluged it in and good to go , i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen , a little overwhelmed with all the features , it could be more stremlined , for a novice user they would be entirely lost , perhaps that is whats on the install disk \( easier setup \) , but my experience self , got through just fine , enabled the maximum security features \( more so then the easy setup button , which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments \)
i'm glad that i bought the carry case with my garmin etrex , because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry i have n't used the belt clip yet , but i liked that option
after reading the online reviews of this product vs the portable product i went with this one portability is not much of a need , i plan on being around a power outlet the sound is in line with a radio boom box of the same size and it 's about the same weight i have a lot of trees around my house so i have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit i have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and i can hear it all over the first floor of my home so far i'm happy that i bought it
i was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system i purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased you can hear the music in several other rooms if the volume is turned up , without distortion
this case is a veritable dirt magnet it attracts more lint than i ever knew existed on my desk however , it protects very well one thing i was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen however , it does n't even touch the ipod also i worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel while it is n't quite as sensitive , it makes it more precise in my opinion , seeing as how i all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when i wanted in the s range without the case on this blue case even looks good on my black ipod , even though i was worried the color would appear muted it 's still vibrant
printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is , cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i'm fine with that
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago one handset gave us problems from the start , but was promptly replaced when returned for service the system works fine in our 2 story , 2 , 300 sq ft home i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street i like the features , including paging system , call transfer , and handset speakerphone being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus i think the sound quality is very good , and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag
i bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it ! it has great sound quality i love the features it has such as speakerphone , caller id , and it 's phone directory the only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice into both directories oher than that , this is a great phone i have owned panasonic and ge cordless phones in the past and had problems i even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late
this fm transmitter is the bomb diggiti ! !
on the plus side , it 's a great value for the games that do work on the t5 simcity alone is probably worth the price
hp premium plus photo paper is the only way to go if you desire tremendous photos from your home printer without any scratching , scuffing or blemishes i have tried less expensive paper from hp as well as other manufacturers the difference in quality is obvious if you want friends and family to think you know what you are doing , share photo 's on hp premium plus glossy paper
excelent , hard drive , good price and good time for seller
i ordered one from an amazon partner for 01 plus shipping , then with my a9 discount the price was even lower so i got one for less than the shipping cost true , the seller made a little on the shipping maybe 4 50 not counting time think how much apple must be making ! the packaging did n't mention nano so with a bit of trepidation i plugged it into the wall and my ipod and my nano liked it ! charging happened it must have been made before the nano came out as other reviewers have said , buy this one and avoid a high price elsewhere
i purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go the case holds the gps , mount and all the different cables the foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or without the velcro staps hold the mount the ac cord this way when you are looking for it , everthing is in one place the case is made well and very plain looking on the outside , so not to draw any attention
very easy to set up , great product picture is great on my samsung 50 inch plasma
it is a pleasure to use this dvd player the quality of the image is superb it upgrades definition on dvds and the difference is very \( favorably \) noticed as compared to that obtaibed from a less than a year old sony player \( with hdmi \) , the difference in image quality absolutely huge
i had a problem with my sunrocket voip and i read that someone had bought this modem and that it solved her problem i gave it a shot and guess what no more dropped calls thank you motorola ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally , the dvi d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a dvi d cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few \( very few \) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of hdmi , nobody really makes them anymore
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand
i am not really a big tech person so i do n't have the mega system hooked up to my computer and dvd tv but i do know that since i got this i have been blasting my music like crazy i do n't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because i have enough space down there and all i have to is lean down anyway i personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud \( considering its computer speakers \) i do n't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when i'm in the shower so i am pretty much happy with them
these speakers are amazing , i am truly shocked to receive something so sweet at an unbelievable price , amazon thank you for the hook up , my speaker system rocks my delivery experience with amazon was great ca n't thank you enough , keep up the great service , truly
i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers , but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks , creatures , or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop , i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max \( yes i underestimated these speakers \) when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume , and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk !
the camera is perfect if using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you the picture is clear not to grainy the only heads up is lighting try to use the camera in a well light area we are stationed in japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home the camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick the best part is the price wo n't break the bank
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon 's free shipping option , but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma mp780 \( that i also bought from amazon \) most of my printing is borderless 8 1 2x11 and the quality is always great definitely worth it if turnaround time is a problem , buy two so you always have a spare
gave as a gift excellent value tune capacity more than sufficient , easy to use and sound quality is right up there must get one for myself
outstanding product as you would expect from panasonic incoming calls loud and clear the scroll telephone directory is convenient and easy to use i do not like the beep sound when the hand set is placed back in the cradle \( it cannot be turned off
i often have problems with memorex brand but have never had a problem with verbati
i do n't think i would have used my i5 without this i just wish it came with the gps instead of having to buy it separately great to easily move my gps from car to car highly recommend
a great solution to theft prevention for this gps the legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box
the reader is fast example i took 56 2mp images from my camera recently i plugged this reader into my g4 , plugged in the card , the card mounted , i dragged the images to my pictures folder , and they copied immediately no waiting i was amazed , because with my mia usb reader , it could take a while to transfer that many images , over a minute a copy dialog did n't even pop up , because it transferred so fast it does n't hurt that it 's a cutie too 5 stars
it 's a canon product made for another canon product how can you go wrong \?
good printer ink , always try to use factory ink and these are with a good price i bought all the colors and paper at the same time all good price and free shipping save gas driving to local stores
operation of the sony dvpnss550 b single disc dvd player has been straight forward picture quality is very good , and the desired basic features have functioned without problems in other words , in the 2 1 2 months since we have owned this player , quality and reliability have been high price too was very reasonable that means durability is the last quality to consider , which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years but we wo n't know that for years
these mini cd rs work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only 42 cents apiece
this is a great multi function printer scanner copier fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload
as long as i own a pair of these headphones , i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again they sound perfect i cannot fathom a more balanced , natural sound these babies put you in the recording studio , or in the concert hall ! bass is crisp , taut , and strong you can feel it yet it is not overbearing or boomy midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist , and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes the folding feature is handy
good sound for the price , and very durable discrete design i prefer the plug design to other headphones they do n't fall out , and i can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane , it makes almost no difference just be careful in the traffic \)
these earphones are excellent quality noise that gets in from outside is so low that i can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me in addition , the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones
i just got my nano last week and the minute i turned it on \( before even transfering any music to it \) i could hear a faint noise buzz from the nano it comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as i turn off the unit has anyone experienced this with theirs \? my first generation nano does not experience this noise i plan to take it to an apple store and try to get a replacement
i have never been a fan of the ipod i have been an iriver h120 , h320 , and h340 owner i had a toshiba gigabeat and currently own an archos av500 the reason for owning a nano is because of the size of the av500 it is too big to pack around unless i am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on the nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote , \( soon \) , i am very happy with it it loads from itunes very easily and i have had no problems with it not playing certain files , \( and i would reencode them if there was a problem \) apple , do n't let me down
the koss pro 4aa 's were not made for ipod mp3 headphone users to begin with , they reveal the low fidelity of mp3 files \( compared with lp 's or cd 's \) also , they require a 1 4 to 3 5mm \( or other \) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment
bought this mouse over 3 months ago , and its still going strong the batteries last forever \( i 've never replaced them yet \) my only problem is that at times , i will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom , but it wo n't seem to turn off ! i reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again , and this always does the trick other than that , very ergonomic , extremely smooth and precise
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop the usb just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse , i ca n't
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well
my first purchase of the q9b resulted in a return as the display was n't mounted properly within the plastic housing this resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1 4 and made the viewing unpleasant the screen also was n't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100 having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it suffice to say , quality control missed this one
you idiot , its not only for psps the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot phones cameras psp tvs computers
after ordering non oem inks from several different places on the web \( and having some problems with them \) , i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices
hp did n't make 13x19 paper when i bought my 13x19 hp printer way to go , hp they may make it now , but i never check , b c i'm totally satisifed w this paper runs smooth and looks great
product was as described reception was strong and weak depending on your location was able to receive all frequencies rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy could get annoying on a very windy day radio is bulky and heavy
i have used gps units from cobra , garmin , and lowrance i consider this cobra unit to be one of the best i started with the cobra but it was stolen after a month then i bought the lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the cobra i returned the lowrance and bought the garmin 340
the unit operates as good as any other gps system available , plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches i am very impressed with the gps , but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed the unit falls off the window and from the dash , plus the power cord comes out too easily the unit deserves a five star rating , but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 , 2005 businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article
if money was no object , i would prefer the totally wireless headset phone , however , this has been a great alternative i have tmj , and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck , while holding my toddler , while preparing dinner , compound my pain go figure ! i find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain , but , the product works great i have had no problems hearing anyone , nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me the earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off , even for someone with elfishly small ears like me !
i 've owned this headphone for about a year now , and i 've got to say , after going through multiple headphones , this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke \( i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon \) , i 'll surely buy another one again !
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer i have w2k at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2 never had any type of compatibility issue this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon
i am very pleased with the quality of the product i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters after the rebate , the price was very competitive
hey , do n't listen to those other schmucks so maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable , but the rest just complain too much i love this thing ! i got it for christmas , and now for 20 , you ca n't beat that i use a standard charger for it in my car , so i never have to worry about batteries it seems that the best way to get it to sound the best , is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using \( equalizer \) i have also used it on my portable dvd player in the car and it sounds awesome ! for the price , i highly recommend this product
i 've used the keyboard mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish of course , any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard mouse setup , but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish
i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish \( odd , i know \) , i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively inexpensive this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch , in quality , my larger studio size headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone , rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case , means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games 5 stars
after buying my ipod , i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock , which is about 300 , your better off only spending about 25 and getting just as good quality
i was unsure at first if this product would work with my ipod nano , but after checking out griffin 's website , i decided to go ahead and order it it works great ! i like to play solitaire and read text files on my nano , so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if i did n't use the screen so much tunejuice means i do n't ever have to worry about that again i just keep a couple of 9v batteries with me , and i can keep listening , playing , reading or whatever on my nano as long as i want love it
i have been using my sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures i have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i did n't want to spend the money on this either , but it is better i really do n't know why , but it is no question about it perfect picture and sound ! i have a yamaha rx v2700 receiver which has hdmi hookups i tried a hdmi cable that came with my directv box \( from my toshiba hd dvd player \) and it was seriously lacking this hookup is much better ! i have a monster cable hdmi hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my sony 46 flat panel as well \( more but \) i'm finally satisfied i'm watching \( and listening to \) batman begins \( in true hd sound \) on hd dvd and it is superb ! ! ! ! this is just awesome ! the stuff of fantasy you only have to buy this these cables once , so why not buy the best \? ! i highly recommend this move
this remote will do everything you need or want simple to use and great customer service i had a couple of glitches \( buttons that did n't work quite right \) when i first programmed the device , but the harmony support team helped me through those areas the changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the harmony web site so if i ever need to , all i have to do is reload the info
i paid about a dollar for this holder holds and protects the ipaq nicely can hold some credit cards as well as id overall a decent product for a low price
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop it 's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks i have been pleased with apc products for about six years they provide excellent customer support i highly recommend their products
it also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time i 've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle \( out of two that come with it \) still looks almost full if the price was a little more consumer friendly i 'd give it five stars i mean come on when you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50 pack of cd r 's for less than 14 , the profit margin on something like this is probably 200 or more
i found this keyboard to be very helpful i am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers while my laptop can be used to type , when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable this keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing the bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if i would like without stopping the connection i would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it overall , a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier
i had it now for 12 months and no problems with it its tiny lightweight and great speed my old computer has to work quite hard to recognize it , but my laptop has no problems
have been using them for a week now
excellent sound , much much much better that the one that comes with any players , zens or ipod
i just recently move from dial up to dsl going dsl was not enough i did not want to have cables running though the house so i started looking into going wireless to make a long story short , after a little investigation i decided to make the leap into wireless technology i purchased the wap55ag router and the adapter cards , wmp55ag and wpc55ag
i am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone it looks good , but more importantly , it feels good button placement , weight , smoothness , everything was done well coming from wired mice , the lack of a wire is very freeing i am also especially happy with how small the usb radio receiver is i am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is
received this speaker as a replacement for the advent aw 810 which did not work at all this one was much easier to install and calibrate ! very happy with range and sound quality highly recommended
these are very comfortable to wear , and the sound is great i use them out jogging , and they stay put , without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise , so be careful around traffic , as you cannot hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone
i bought these ear headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club the sound quality is acceptable , not exceptional the construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right that places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out i have no idea why sony thought that this was a good design for the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord i would give these a b good not great
the logitech cordless trackman wheel was purchased in sept 2006 i have had this for two months at the time this review is being written
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer it works just as well as the corded one when i'm in my office for travel , the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel it 's not a small , usb stick that goes in the back it 's a long , corded , mouse looking device that sends recieves the signal to the trackman i do n't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel all that said , i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
my canon 510 got glowing reviews just about across the board , but not this printer i have very little space , and needed something small just for photos so , even though there were many negative reviews i went ahead and bought it could n't be happier ! colour fabulous ! and when you print on stock paper you can use photo to do some extra artwork on i love it
product nicely made , looks like quality product and performs fine
my wife and i used the fr300 during the week long queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered one 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume the cell phone charger is cool , but it takes a lot of winding the light is good in a pinch , but not particularly useful
this map set met all my expectations , and was far more current than i had expected software for turn by turn directions on roadways while driving works great with the garmin ctrex gps recommended to load many states you will need large memory card , 1 gb
if you buy this service plan , print out the contract and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan , but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it
easy enough to pop off the normal ant \( roadmate 700 \) and pop on this magmount version and what a difference it made ! signals really are remarkedly improved highly suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you 'll get the birds
a lot cheaper than model specific docking stations , and 'does what it says on the tin' quite stylish too , as docking stations go
we used the gtx600vp4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling the 5 watt power gave us ample range does it reach 18 or 20 miles , do n't know but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains it 's a great way to stay in touch when traveling the batteries are rechargeable , both a c d c the ear pieces were very good for privacy very easy to use and well worth the price a good investment
i was hesitant to get this , since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception now that i bought it , i'm very glad i have it it does all the things you might want in a disaster , inluding a flashlight , red flashing light \( especially if your car breaks down at night \) , a siren \( if you 're trapped in a building \) , ac , battery , and crank power , and multiple radio bands while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations , in a disaster , you only need a few stations , as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news between the am , fm , tv , and noaa bands , my radio will received a huge number of stations many more than would ever be needed in a disaster \( i did n't try the cellphone charging function \) it comes in a carrying case
i just recieved my hdmi cable and am very impressed the price is just what it should be about 5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over 100 for this cable at a store the service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days ! i highly recommend this cable i just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the tv and wow what a great picture all around the color is just so much more vivid using hdmi compared to component 3 wire connectors get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others
this is the perfect keyboard \( i know cuz i am typing on it right now \) i recommend if you like media boards
sandisk has done it again they never seem to let me down with their products i was in the market for another memory chip since i kept filling up my smaller 128 mb chip the price was the deciding factor for me , as being a college student the financial situation was tight but this product was perfect , right price , excellecnt storage space , good name get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
fast shipping , very happy with the garmin their tech support is good they answer all questions will buy from amazon again will buy a garmin agai
this is great ! my only problem is the knob for adjusting it 's to loose
i bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a 9 99 mouse , and i 'll never turn back this mouse is outstanding for gaming it 's pretty damned accurate , and it easily fits in my hand good price , too
i you own a smartphone , you 'll need one of these also happy this came with an adapter card , to plug in the microsd into it to move data from my mac to the phone
the sandisk 1gb micro sd card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging i installed it in my motorala razr v3m as expanded memory for my music library be sure to remove the razr battery to clear the access slot for the micro sd the v3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems i used motorola phone tools to transfer my entire music library the program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer the entire music library a full 1gb transferred reasonably quickly the v3m is slow to access my music using menu function 3 under get tunes tones function 6 manage music accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well the new corded motorola syn1301b stereo earbuds work well in this configuration sound quality is surprisingly good , but the large diameter earbuds are flat not tapered and do not seat very well in the ear canal the sandisk 1gb microsd card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the v3m as cell phone with mp3 player
i upgraded from some speakers i purchased when i built my system the sound difference was wonderful it is a clean crisp fresh sound worth every penny
pros
okay so it was about 8 45 at night i was coming on to a 1 2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live i was doing 60mph , the speed limit is 40 as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small k band warning i instantly slow down to the speed limit as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph then it gets to full k band i look to my left where there is a service parking area , and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car as i pass the police car , i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead
this is my second escort passport 8500 x50 the first one is in another car it saved me many times for getting caught though i'm not maniac driver the detection range is very good , it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car i love the blue color and it only costs 30 more than red the only problem that i have experienced on my first one is sometimes i got laser false warning signals , especially on raining day with defog is on i heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes x50 pop and laser false warning signals , and my first x50 is in my turbo charged car i'm not sure if pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much , i have it turned off overall , it 's very good detector , you will get payback if you own one
the best headphones i ever had , good fit excellent sound on my soundblaster x fi ! !
i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below \( followed exactly \) there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase , i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 , this is what worked for me at any rate
works with ipod skin , no need to take off cover looks good has connections for audio , tv cables and remote are additional included are 5 adapters for all ipods that have doc connector
this is a great storage device i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse i love the lanyard , that helps me to keep track of the drive worth every i paid for it !
this is a very nice set of paper and envelopes the price is really great the paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double the colors come out very bright and the folding is easy overall it is a good deal
i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my 2 4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone , i can contact her to talk to her
i am extremely pleased with the purchase i am using it in my office simple plug and play \( no brainer \) ! !
like most other reviews , i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit movies are amazing ! my music collection never sounded so good if you want to get away from it all for awhile , slip these babies in your ears and chill
i bought usb rudder pedals and yoke for use with x plane on a mac dual g5
i needed a simple solution for my office i wanted to be able to use the phone , but not get tied down by the handset , or the headset here was my solution , since the ts105b has the 2 5mm port for a headset , i purchased a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office so far wow ! ! ! its worked out great the phone is also good by itself , plus it was inexpensive through amazon for anyone interested in going the route i took you will not be disappointed
i have had this tv since mid march 2006 i absolutley love it ! ! i did extensive research before i bought a large screen tv and found that this samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck i read some reviews saying that dlp technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect , especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action one reviewer specifically said to try playing bourne supremecy to see an example of the rainbow effect this was the first dvd i played on this tv and i did not once have a problem with rainbow effect overall i have no complaints with this tv samsung has produced an excellent product i recommend either satellite or hd programming for the best picture regular cable comes in sort of grainy
there is a little story before this
this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag , and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset , ie turn off the headset , receiver and ipod all from the headset instead , i have to get the ipod back out , turn it off , turn the receiver off , then turn the headset off
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon , and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair \( took about 10 minutes to do , let it cure overnight \) headphones look ok , with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards \( reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses \) sound is very good \( better than most earbuds \) , they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever , and range is outstanding my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on , and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco , and they are only partially functional with the nano \( ca n't use the advance track feature of the headphones \)
i am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from case logic this is a great product and is manufactured well holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out i do n't transport them so i ca n't comment on that like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up get this if you need a lot of storage
this headphone extension is perfect ! it is not as long as described \( about 15 feet \) but that 's o k with me the connections are tight \( the plugs do n't pull apart \) it maintains sonic quality it also retains it 's elasticity using this extension cord my grado sr 60 's sound better than any wireless phones you wo n't be dissapointed !
this is a pretty decent cheapo case if you want something that you 'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs , then you may want to get something a little sturdier for my archival purposes , however , it works just fine
purchase service
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
this was by far the easiest computer peripheral i have ever setup ! works flawlessly with my netgear wireless router
it is remarkable that , even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence , none of them are near perfect i tried four different cases , both hard plastic and silicone variants , and the iskin case comes the closest , protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days love the service at amazon
these are the best period ! look no further because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes after 3 conversations with canon customer care , we decided it was not the printer , but the cheaper ink i switched back to canon , bit the bullet on the price , and everything is fine i found decent prices on amazon , particularly at eek industries
this is a nifty very small musical device that i use when exercising its great holds all the songs i can listen to and is so portable i really like i
i was so happy with my creative zen nano that i bought one as a gift i love the color choice and the sound is great love the pause button it came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band you do not need to buy one ! ! amazon delivered it in 2 days
this printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrived
this is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality
i'm using monster optical cable as well , but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf
sound quality is very good , and i have n't run out of battery so far the base is somewhat smaller than what i expected from the pictures the handsets are well designed on my previous phone it happened that the mute function became engaged when i kept the phone between my head and my shoulders this did not happen with these so far speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages answering machine works well easy to copy phonebook entries between phones
this does exactly what it is supposed to do it is light , easy to pack , easy to use , and probably difficult to crack
i tried both microsoft 's lifecam vx 3000 and vx 6000 had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core 3 00ghz cpu with 2 gigs of ram and , with both of those , the video lagged the audio \( distractingly so \) spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening \( got through on their toll free line \) and he pointed me to new software for the vx 6000 downloaded the 50 meg plus file , installed it , but the vx 6000 still produced out of sync video vs audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker
easy to operate and good focus just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
garmin ique m5
we bought this about a month ago from amazon the product itself seems fine we used it on a vacation drive from nj to myrtle beach and back at times , it was a help \( like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in va and we needed an alternate route \) however , you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it does n't always recommend the best or shortest route also , it was missing certain stores , restaurants , etc that had been around for awhile
this phone was an additional phone for the model ip811 2 phone system used for vonage this system has every feature that i could want , including range and quality , there are no negatives i am highly recommending this phone and system
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture you would n't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing i have shown it to an i pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the i pod
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap 76s to my hp laptop so far it has performed perfectly i have not tried to use it for other applications yet , so i ca n't comment on how well it would work in other situations
i find this printer to be better than hp or epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles , just a solid printer that performs as i anticipated
the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice , i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me
i bought four of these so far they appear to work well they do not work with compact flourescent lights well , but are fine with incandescent bulbs
i bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17 hyundai l90d \( which is a great low priced screen for gaming \) , which was the replacement for a dell fp2100 \( that i gave to my wife \) anyways , this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times \( more than enough for my flight sims \) movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution has n't been a problem the design is probably the neatest looking out there \( subjective i realize \) the only gripe i have w this monitor is lack of swivel \( sigh \) other than that i'm very pleased with everything about this screen
wow just got one of these at a great price , hooked it up to my mac g4 via a dvid cable , and it boots up at native resolution \( 1680 x 1050 \) automatically no muss , no fuss text is crisp and clean
my favorite thing about this phone is that the caller id captures 11 digit numbers \( 1 xxx xxx xxxx \) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call my old phone only captured 10 digits \( xxx xxx xxxx \) which meant i had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first this new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number i put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in very handy as far as being a phone , it does everything well and after a couple of months i am still as happy as could be with it
this is the rockinest think i 've ever seen or buyed dudes ! ! ! check it ou
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking , hiking , kayaking , and in the car to i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
ok here 's the deal i 've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years i love my magellan i 've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface \( the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me \) and how the menu structure was built
i had been talking about wanting an mp3 player , but i did not want an ipod , as i heard you cannot add files in windows format and that 's what all of my music is i received this e260 4 gb mp3 player for my birthday in june 2006 , and this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned although there are a few little quirks , overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this mp3 player
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i 've never written a review , but i 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other amazon buyers , so i felt a really good product like the anycom bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review
i was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer the photo output is awesome and it 's very fast !
i'm a skeptic no , i mean i'm really a skeptic especially in today 's marketplace \( because nothing is built like it used to be \) i do n't buy anything without checking it out first , and even then , i expect that it 's probably going to fail me when i do yeah , wonderful view there , huh \?
the sound of these earbuds are great and they are a value for the price
using this kingston chip on my pearl 8100 phone and it has worked flawlessly
i work in a computer lab where we constantly re image devices \( using norton ghost \) i have 3 laptops and 1 dell gx620 desktop and all of them have gigabit connection when i connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous , i get the same performance \( 0 differences \) as i run 1 laptop to the gx620 this testing was done with cat5 cables that i pick randomly from my lab i ca n't wait to add more devices and using cat6 cables to get my work done faster
the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car however , the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs the 9 feet using the gps 's internal antenna when in an open area garmin 's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around \( on my gps \) i feel the antenna was worth purchasing
i use the suctions mount antenna because i remove from sight whenever i leave my car which is idea for my purposes the antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock the only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up
this unit has a v in my thought was that one could play video games on it , or view images from a camcorder digital camera however , all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen so it does not allow me to do all i wanted it is also a bit on the loud side if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit i got one of those also , and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor it also does not make much noise
this is a great swicth with low price i use it together with d link di 704 4 port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 pc , two servers , one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp connecting via the swicth for internet sharing does n't show any noticeable slow response as compared to connecting via the router directly it works well by itself as we as with d link di 704
i would highly recommend this phone set easy to program and crystal clear reception a definite 5 star
works well with canon 10d , 30d , and s40 fairly fast write speed and 4gb pretty big \( 1600 jpgs in the 30d ! \)
for the epson photo 1270 , the photo quality and color are excellent i have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer
this product was very easy to set up hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time been running 3 months with no problems what so ever would highly recommend
i am amazed by the quality of the guitar the product is extremely good the service by amazon was ultimate thanks a lot amazon
since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas , i recommend you get this one depending on type of your ipaq \( 1900 series vs 3000 series \) , you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case once you 're done , however , it 's very easy to use and carry it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket , unlike so many other cases the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface , this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection \( klutzes be warned \) the leather feels surprisingly good , almost a lambskin kind of quality the credit card space is not very useful , but you can shove a couple of business cards in there a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
this is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers you do n't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming ! excellent travel accessory
works exactly as advertised i travel a lot and i can finally enjoy those long travel hours in planes calmly
unit 's range shorter than expected , but i feel that i got what i wanted , and paid for shipping and delivery were great
i was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both ! ! it 's very easy to learn and enter stuff i'm a first time pda owner and this is an excellent product !

if you 're looking for isolation from ambient noise , these are great i use them as in ear monitors for my onstage use \( rock band \) , and if i use the foam inserts , i can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off
i found this on clearance at another retailer \( i guess not everyone likes pink \) , and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for skinny armed people , but not so ! i 've got plenty of room , it fits great , and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way , though makes mowing the lawn way more fun
the phone works great ! i have three of these and a base the best phones i have had the other phones i have are the tcx800 model \( previous version \) , equally good
i just use the keyboard like a business user i do n't use the media stuff i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works i like that it 's not huge and does n't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use the rechargeable mouse is handy as well prior to this , i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row , and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me i do n't know if it 's because it 's logitech or it 's bluetooth , but the keyboard mouse are as responsive as were they wired \( after they wake up \)
i used the tripp lite to charge my powerbook and digital camera during a cross country trip to grad school it worked great and i had no problems the only thing i could have used was a second outlet
esactly what i was wanting when you turn there is resistance \( springs i think \) and everything works great if you use flight sims you need this product works awsome

this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need as a chronically disorganized person , the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings the strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic , so shocks are well absorbed
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
great sound quality great signal quality i can hear everyone well , and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well the main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger , with a couple walls in between , and i have no problems with signal
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you do n't have big hands it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely , even if you are left handed the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who do n't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward , backward , and switch between programs the button in the middle though \( the one that lets you switch programs \) is out of the way it takes just a bit more effort to use , meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button i actually hardly ever use that button i ca n't live without the forward backward buttons though i find myself man handling other mice thinking they too have those neat , little buttons the mouse has a really good response to movement as well i 've used it for gaming as well , though i admit i'm not a hardcore gamer i really recommend this mouse i ca n't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
pros
i love it you can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
this is an excellent product if you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you i am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day i have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places the garmin gps 18 plugs right into the usb port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments i 'll admit nroute took a little getting used to \( for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you 're not going to find it \) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie instead of spelling hoover street you just type hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations a great buy for only 100 bucks ! if you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of gps , dont spend 500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome gps sensor for only 100
obviously , there are far better printers on the market but if you 're looking for a quality 3 in one in the 100 to 150 range , this one seems to be at the top of the pack
since i 've seen musicians use jbl speakers for their concerts , that gave me a trust in their product with that , i became an owner to a desktop jbl pc cpeaker this product has been satisfactory and by far i have no complaints from it
note this is a review of the targus pa225u retractable phone ethernet cord \( plastic casing \) it 's the rectangular model , not the oval shaped one
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well
i just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup i had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck however , with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear it is so small and just excellent great work , logitech
i have the canon mp500 printer and canon rebel xt camera both capable of producing amazing results , but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers if you are looking to print out very impressive photos , then i would recommend getting the 8x10 photo plus glossy definitely nice enough to frame and with plus glossy , you 're definitely saving instead of paying to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my mp500 and printed using plus glossy , and the print is significantly better than the original
i tested my new canon i960 with a variety of papers like most printers , the output is much better when using the manufacture 's own paper \( as opposed to the cheaper generic paper \) , but there is no need to buy the most expensive pro paper as neither i nor my wife could discern any difference between the two there may be a benifit to the pro paper that cannot be seen \( lasts longer \? \) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your canon printer \( i think they look better than the ones i get from the photo lab \)
i 've had this for at least 8 months now we 've used it with xd , sd , memory stick pro , pro duo \( with the adapter \) and a few misc cards that friends' cameras may be using
this reciever is great ! it even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building i have played with many gps units and have yet to see a reciever do that this is a definte buy it is extremely accurate also i highly recomend it
the gps works in both my dell axim x5 and in my hp compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card i have used it with ms streets and trips and arcpad
you know , shrek 2 is the embarassment of american culture what 's wrong with it you ask \? let 's see too much slapstick humor , too many movie references , or parodies , and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying classic disney characters ! ! ! that 's just unbelievable , dreamworks ! disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry , and you just make fun of them that 's a real shame you should be thanking disney for all what animation offers nowadays disney classics have heart , humor , and a beautiful story shrek 2 lacks that shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility , never to be seen again ! !
when the lead character acts like she 's sleepwalking through the entire film , that 's distracting ! when just about anyone from my high school 's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth , then it 's time to open up the wallet , and hire better talent
this dvd was horrible i did n't know what to expect but after the first 10 minutes i was thinking is this it \? ! what 's going on \? where are they \? what am i watching \? after awhile i clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary nothing they do n't even tell you where they are \? ! it 's basically a 45 minute music video and the music , although i like it , does n't fit with the footage at all i really do n't understand the point of this project i watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding total waste of time and money and i am a jack johnson fan
during a missing persons investigation , a cop samuel l jackson gets kidnapped by a gang of thieves meanwhile , an elaborate bank robbery is about to go down of course , samuel does great as always , but the script and especially the very slow pace brings it down what sounded like a good movie turned out to be a dissapointment far from being the worst movie you can rent , but , it's just not as good as it sounds maybe next time , they won't take all day to get started
i started liking this movie , i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out , if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal underground cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late if you like the depressing , gritty , wild , fastpaced style of this movie , check out the original master robert crumb , toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of this is crap in noncomformity , and dont say i didnt get it , i just think hes being hugely self indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry , lacking the wit , psychedelia , and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly
this film is one of the worst i 've ever seen amatuerish in dialogue , acting , plot direction etc etc sure it 's bubblegum for late at night but it 's really breathtakingly awful
i found this dvd to be very slow there is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long most of this time is spent talking , not streching
this is the kind of morbid vulger trash that warner brothers does now with them it 's a show that is full of sex , graphic content , and a life style that is really damging to one 's mental and physical health this show and it 's studio are no better then disney and their desperate housewives show that treats women like call girls it 's all represents a hollywood that is out of control and completely gone off the edge i condem them both
this director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art artsy fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about speaking russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort
this has got to be the biggest stinker in denzel 's long movie career , just after the oscar winning philadelphia , he went on to star in this cult sci fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game , russel crowe also stars in this very , and i mean very bad movie but hey , if you 're a sci fi fan , watch this , but do n't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars on account , this movie did n't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the hollywood critic , the only movie with two lead star to not hit the box office this low budget sleepy movie is n't worth watching , if you love sci fi , that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race , pick up a true 5 star hollywood material like , 'a i' , 'terminator' 'i' , 'ii' , 'iii' or will smith 's new movie , 'i , robot'
where to start with this bad movie \?
i am referring to the laser light dvd edition of this film , which promises the best digital transfer of the film that is great , but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer ! i taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version i taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv ! in reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better vhs version and i would recommend that over this do not be fooled like i was with the fine condition of welles' the trial by laser light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this this version of arkardin is a total waste of money
i thought this video was really going to encourage my toddler to use his potty but it did n't this video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty i was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty this video did n't do it , so i'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning todlers need visuals and actions , the bear on this video does more talking than actual actions
the award winning documentary freestyle , looks like something fresh , creative , and new from the exterior i was psyched to purchase this dvd the minute i heard about it
fyi this is the retail friendly edited version of guys gone wild heatstroke to show less raunchy material , making it acceptable at mainstream retailers be sure to get heatstroke instead if you want the full uncensored version of this title
totally disappointed whole series is a joke should be call guys act stupid amature editing and directing
okay , i own a britney album or two but the girl really let herself go she should have stayed in school , instead of the mickey mouse club or at least beauty school or something , then she might have known that the hair she has now is hideous i know i'm not the only one who thinks she 's turing into trailer trash except , she 's got money that hair \? her clothes \? and lets face it guys , she was putting on weight way before she got pregnant fashion senses aside she 's really more idiotic , that chaotic she 's got this princess in distress act that only her die hard fans ca n't see through i saw her in concert once , yeh i admit it paid for me and a friend to go was gonna go see the onyx hotel tour too , just because but when i saw it on showtime , i was so glad she canceled the tour and i got my money back her vocals were horrible , and it was so bad when mtv picked it up and they were obviously doctored she has absolutely no talent whatsoever and her vision is incredibly lacking her bland personality and complete naiivity and idiotic behavior makes itself evident in this show that is n't even bareable for a minute
this late keaton material when the actor desperately needed funds is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with keaton rolling in his grave at this release
i did n't find this dvd too bad to watch , but i would n't watch it again it had tons of good artists but i dont wanna have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews i think this dvd needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin , just my opinion
i love asian movies i like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of hollywood these days 2047 however , was the first asian movie that i failed to finish becaase of the sheer boredom of the plot do n't get me wrong , the main actor \( clark gable look alike \) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous , but the movie itself imo is overrated you can argue art all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you \( not my bag at all \) i kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to realize oh my god it 's not over ! boring
what 's all the fuss about ms hepburn does n't act our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time eddie albert 's restraint is utterly unbelievable any two bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions ! what is peck left with \? a long life of knowing he 's got a girl friend he ca n't touch , see , or speak with
this is without question the worst movie ever made it makes plan 9 from outer space look like 2001 roger ebert must be a genius no one could accidentally make a movie this bad i guess it 's a comedy that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny
five gen x yuppies \( yup , they 're old enough to be that now \) reunite for the funeral of one of their friends what ensues is a parody of the big chill , complete with bad 80s music then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one , turning them into murderous zombies so far , so eccentric , and the satire is sometimes very funny the fx are so bargain basement , however , and the plotting so loose , that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half hour after a rather promising set up zach galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie
this product is way outdated for todays advanced technology it is appropriate for crt tv 's but not for lcd 's very disappointed ! !
i like sandler
'the sword and the sorcerer' released in '82 is a mixed bag of positive and negative
except for the presence of kevin bacon , whom i like a lot , this would have been a real loser there were so many things wrong directed by paul glaser with no surprises , no depth of character , a too heavy handed hollywood scenario you knew what was coming a mile away there was good cinematography and music , and kevin bacon is always appealing , but that 's the best i can say oh , and the nun she was pretty good too the lead black man was also engaging the problem was really the script too pat , and too many unbelievable things that screamed hollywood like when the village burned down they were ready to just up and leave where they 'd lived for generations as if it takes generations to rebuild their houses and there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game and bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain , get cut in the groin , then play basketball , all on a rotten knee please
lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out , ot it 's me that im losing the charm for watching movies and it more into the first one
i hate to be the dissenting voice here , but the boost is one of the most hilariously bad , cliched and over the top pictures i 've seen in a long while it 's so silly it unintentionally wanders into john waters territory several times the thing is , james woods acts like he 's on coke before his character starts doing coke , so when he actually starts the coke binge , the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness still , it has its moments , such as sean young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage , or woods explaining that cocaine just takes your natural energy and amplifies it a good title would be national lampoon 's cautionary cocaine tale of the 1980s
this movie does a very good job of portaying an alcoholic that has not yet found the program of alcoholics anonymous the aa meetings in this movie are packed with self centered selfish and restless , irrtable and discontented people who meet to share their misery real aa meetings offer experience , strength and hope , and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director to bad this one is n't a very good story
antonio banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you ca n't believe he ever got wealthy when he 's running around giving money freely to a woman \( angelina jolie \) who lied to him from the moment they met she did n't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl , so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry well , we never get to see the pretty girl , because jolie must have killed her too the only reason this woman is hot is because she 'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody \( if you 've seen gia , you 'll know what i mean \) neither she or banderas \( who is n't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent \) have any chemistry , and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her my guess \? the age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed , and all the sex in this movie gets old fast it 's so stupid , because nobody has interludes like that unless they 're shooting a blue movie the only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot
can someone please tell me where to get the re mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles \? the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio , or english audio , but no english subtitles !
this film itself deserves 4 stars at least im givin this s a one cause its a f bootleg i tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an x box and it would not play then when i finally got it to play , it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like s if your into purchasing s like that then i guess this is for you i advise you to cop this movie somewhere else
i just finished re reading the book it is a masterpiece i wish i could say the same for the bbc series for one , the musical score is either absent or irritating so much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the characters how about voice overs or something else \( music \? \) \? let the audience in on the torment and conflict of raskolnikov \( the main character \) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book what i saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film i 've written much more but it 's unfortunately been truncated simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book this is a dreary protrayal
i thought that this movie would be pretty interesting the previews for it made it seem like it was funny i however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid the charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground also the running time was too long , it says it was just a little over 2 hours , but to me it felt like much more
this is i suppose anybody who 'd hire adam sandler and or tea leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from cro magnon man could watch i lasted 20 minutes the jokes are older than me , and they were n't funny when they were born
when danny devito 's plays larry garfield he is like taxi 's louie de palma of wall street
teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross i can understand implying that two ex cons have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie with cheap double entendre and to stoop so low as to give a lead male character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous \( ok , director we 'get it' all men are secretly gay ! you made your point , move on ! \) i ca n't even imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this film the least bit interesting much less stimulating \( for an intelligent crime caper with a same sex subplot see bound \) since this movie is supposed to take place in wisconsin they give the locals a southern accent an absolute bore
people that love this series are misguided at best it sucks i mean completely stinks i will be putting set on ebay
this is a terrible missues of one of asimovs greatest novels the relevance to the novel is only marginal
date movie should be shown non stop to all captured al qaeda prisoners only mass murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish let me be perfectly clear about this date movie may be the worst movie ever made it 's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of you may cry , you may scream , you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film , but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here not once it does n't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks the only thing i got out of this movie was an awful headache if you ask me , everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years if not for life had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to date movie , he would have stayed in the ocean
date movie is from two of the six writers of scary movie , apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter a few chuckles here and there but that 's all
do n't get me wrong i'm a fierce anti communist but the stupidity of this movie is just unbearable all the american clich s about russians and ussr are reunited here , and it should be studied at school as an example of gross caricature the ridiculous russian language imitations , the dissenters presented as freedom soldiers , whereas a child knows today they never used violence as a mean to achieve their goals , the jews presented as traitors \( the scientist 's wife looks like ethel rosenberg \) the idea of stealing so easily such a weapon , the reaction of secretary general \( and not premier \) , to send another firefox , whereas he could just use this incident to accuse the united states of stealing if you should see an intelligent cold war movie , check out white nights \( it 's a shame it is n't on dvd yet \) or the 7th protocol , far more intelligent than this gross , highly unprobable childish parody the chase star wars like scene is way too long and looks dated today clint eastwood , shame on you
i have seen other pokemon movies , but this was the worst the plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as i thought and mew does not fit in the story when it is about lucario
watching this movie , i am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible , and make it drag out on the screen the disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be , and how poor direction , and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness i wo n't even go into historical inaccuracies , or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject , the audience and history instead of respect
every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point as if you 're a short attention span coach potatoe ehhh , ah yes , you are well , watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does two or three nice ideas , the rest is very superficial and underutilized probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people what i would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire !
some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops , she 's sent to gymnastics camp \( she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker \) she thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid , she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time , it 's all her parents fault of course because she 's perfect , her dialogue consists of nothing but smart aleck remarks that she says in that oh so cute way that fans of lizzie mcguire may find clever good grief this is just beyond unwatchable even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old , and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds it just grates on your nerves until you 're about ready to shove the dvd through the paper shredder
i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway worst film ever , i dont care if this did'nt help you , this film p ! ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review how is it meant to be entertainin
i am a yoga instructor and i bought this dvd hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students this dvd is not a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title ! what i did see was a woman who was very flexible , quite possibly a dancer , doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements in most of the movements she taught , this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion
i remember taking a minute of my time to watch this dung when it premiered a couple years back , and lets just say i find watching something download more than this i swear i hate preps the most in this country
the last time i saw the names adam goldberg and giovanni ribisi together , they were two american soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain private ryan
for the idiot that wrote that day 1 for fifty was in 2003 stay in da south ur abviously dont know that fifty has been on the seen since 98 u idoit ur a fake rap fan and u should know ya history instead of talking on curtis jackson 2003 what a douche bag
the show is not so funny it repeats itself and it has too much music , dancing and intros for my favour watch instead mad t v or the chapelle show
when i first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty some years ago , i honestly thought it was a joke i mean , the young people in this 1938 b w film almost make ward and june cleaver look cool 1938 , is this right \? the three stooges were still new at that time if parents truly wish for their off spring to avoid blowing weed , they may not want to choose to show them this dvd it 's so hard to take seriously thank goodness there are n't any 'extra features' here i do n't think i could 've taken it 'reefer ' does have a sole purpose , to watch maybe every two years after dark when there is n't any thing good on tv
flightplan , or flightpanned is implausible posturing and shrieking its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness you know where the movie is going within 20 minutes and just like a real plane flight , you spend the rest of the time waiting for it to end
most of the characters in this movie are great , the scenes , the costumes and everything but i did n't like the outcome of the story i felt daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and i could n't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl to be honest i never liked gwendolyn 's character at all , she was selfish , self centered and annoying , yet towards the end i felt very sorry for her , after all she 'd gone through for daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them
despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie , this is really pretty sick stuff , with little or no redeeming social context objectively , sick just is n't erotic , no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so those who think differently really ought to either \( a \) focus a little more \( b \) examine their true motives or \( c \) get a life
how i made it through this poorly executed , poorly written sequel , i have no idea catherine 's in trouble again and people she meets are dying who 's the murderer , catherine , the shrink who lusts over her , or the cop who 's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key \? catherine certainly gets around she manages to befriend the most unlikely of people , all associates or ex wives or enemies of the shrink , and most of them end up dead is she trying to drive the shrink nuts , or does she plan to kill him \?
from a big jt , brit , and x tina fan this dvd is soooo disappointing the dvd is comprised of whole episodes of mmc and very little of the episodes has britney , justin , or christina featured there is only one song where brit and justin sing \( a duet \) , and only one where christina sings other than that , all they basically show are lame hometown profiles which last about 60 seconds each you get better content from a behind the music or driven episode there 's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely nothing to do with britney , justin , or christina lame , lame , lame , and disappointing i think the total on screen time of real content is about 12 minutes save your money
they should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre this series should have been killed off by now the first was not even worth watching ! stay away from this whole movie series
being a texas chainsaw fan i of course picked this one up it has 2 big stars in it , and was directed by one of the writers of the original i'm not sure what they were going for in this one is it a horror , a sick comedy \? it is all over the place what is worse is that they made leatherface a wimpy crossdresser the ending leaves you scratching your head mathew and renee do their best with the material
this is my vote for 3rd worst movie ever made
qd3 has put out some good product before but thid dvd is kind of weak the roxanne battles , epmd , krs nelly , canibus ll , and ice cube vs cyprus hill was dope but the dvd feels incomplete the grandmaster caz vs the sugarhill gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie i would love to hear big ban hank try to refute what caz says the royce d12 beef was obviously a replacement for the eminem source beef and word is the source punked them out of using the footage
in my humble opinion , the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars , e g the corvair , buscemi 's caddy and cuervo 's 1959 buick
this film had a few laughs but was pretty run of the mill pauley shore pretty much did the same role over over but this film had a alright charm to it for a few minutes i saw it again recently after some years it had the same vibe to me then as now
i do n't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length once again cheap fox wo n't buy the music rights there is sections \( i think \) that have been either doctored or just cut out you 'll be watching an episode and you 'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment you 'll think it 's your eyes but it 's not thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color even though my review is n't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t v so they 're all still worth buying
i really dont understand how people find this show funny maybe back in the day it was something hot , but now its not
yul brynner stalks about like he 's in westworld , acting super tough , smoking every chance he gets steve mcqueen , as always , is terrible as for the rest of the 7 , their acting is atrocious to non existent only eli wallach walks away unscathed yet if these things are irritating , it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous yul brynner actually says that he might rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically amazing this could have ever been construed as being tough it 's just ridiculous , and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames but i 'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed
not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable it has none of the living comic book charm that i loved in the first one that and there are only three stories and more animation only the blob in the water one was worth watching if you see it , watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo ! funny romero and king seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one
3 short films \? ! \? ! \? thats it \? \? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used ! it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this chief wooden head isnt scary at all if you think that is scary , you are easily frightened the raft is defiantely the best on here by far that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit especially the ending to it ! ! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says thanks for the ride lady over and over i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead that one is better
well if this movie had a story then i must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it they do n't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that 's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking \( as one of the reviewer declared \) about 2 people having sex
their music is great , the videos are n't the most amazing thing i 've ever seen i listen to the b boys quite a bit , but i do n't find a video dvd to have much replay value
this line , spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie \( believe it or not \) and it only got worse christie 's character diana scott marries an italian man who hello , is old enough to be father ! and oh yes , he 's an aging prince \( in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana almost made me laugh \) that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv \( a la elvis presley \) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man \( three words anna nicole smith \) also , i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress \? she did n't at all because it should \( and i mean should \) of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music \( my pick for the best movie of the 1960 's \) because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins , for which she won the oscar , she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there 's a problem with the academy they ca n't seem to pull the trigger in giving back to back oscars to the same person
if you own or have watched the blue planet series you 're going to recognize all of the footage why \? because you 've already seen it except this time it 's going to be without the informative narrative
i did n't think of it much as a movie as i did a porn frenzy i'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know caligula was nuts otherwise , then i guess so was all of the roman empire i simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy it was stupid , simple and as soon as it was done i immediately threw it out not for the faint of heart not for the sophisticated either or anywhere in between
this is the most tedious , unfunny , overrated movie of all time it 's interesting that this is from the same man who produced spaceballs , which was actually rather humorous \( though also quite tedious at times \) i 'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it 's so funny his utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold
has a pretty thin plot ice 'cave' man is
on the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama
first off i do not dislike adam sandler , i rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film , not so much because i like raunchy antics , but because of the underlying message adam sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this you can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting , farting etc , but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him , he is loyal to his fans and to his friends ever notice how he always gives jobs to rob schneider and dana carvey \? no one else does , that 's a good friend , also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich , evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films he never sinks to there level either , perhaps that is why ecn was such a creepy , deeply disturbing film , i cannot , in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies , what was he thinking \? early on in the film his character , a drunken loser , belches very loudly in a chinese restaurant ok i go take shower now says chinese waiter i wanted to take a shower too , very soon after that scene for starters mr sandler seems to think he is a voice over man , he is not his idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard one can barely understand he is trying to do a character , and he barely is also he is the voice of at least four of his characters , he is equally bad in each perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house , he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something , he coaches the kids basketball team , he has been for years , and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him , he is simply there to be lovable , and put upon , he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face \( as is the so called humor here \) the script calls for sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end , there is no real motivation for his bazaar , cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them he starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures , a menorah and a christmas thing , i forget what it was he is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one , but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence , he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink , i can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads , surly , even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book not here of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go the film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous , mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms he goes to the basketball game and insults the children , ridiculing one boy for being fat , the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants nice kitty kitty he squeaks , what the \? \? \? \? then an angry father gets on sandlers bad side \( his only side \) and is force fed a jock strap i hope you like them extra sweaty ho ho ho for the next part of the film which seems like eight days , crazy or otherwise , his house is burned , he pushes his benefactor down a hill , in a porta potty which freezes feces on him , he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him , on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth we are treated to this twice god bless us , every one by the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs , each worse then the last , fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad if i move my bowls without using the spray that 's a technical foul is one of few lines i remember , thank you god by reading this one might assume , as i did , that this is irreverent in the good way , poking fun at old christmas standards , but it is not it is disgusting , badly written , annoying and very , very cruel the two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly , for no good reason with no motivation or payoff , the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand , this is not always a bad thing of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk , a childhood trauma involving a car crash on hanukkah , he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after the same cannot be said for the audience why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate , who is the audience \? there are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place , the over all feel of the film is one of depressed sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness adam sandler has been loyal to his friends , his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was , even if it hurt his feelings this christmas turkey wo n't even work as leftovers bah humbug
i bought this dvd because amy jo johnsen is in it \( one of my favorite actresses \) what i expected was a decent vampire movie , with some blood and guts , and a good storyline what i got was a movie with talking , talking and more talking , and a boring storyline i saw hardly any action , hardly any fun , and hardly anything interesting i was extremely disappointed in amy for starring in such a boring , unintriguing movie the only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between seth and viki 's ex it was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations , and useless talking
although deleted scenes are promised on the back cover of the box , there are no deleted scenes on the dvd instead there 's a perfunctory documentary which interviews the cast and other creators , who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film in this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that are n't in the film , but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that hopefully will be in the dvd deleted scenes section
all 4 movies in this set are dubbed in english i was horribly disappointed dont make the same mistake i did find the dubbed ones
i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake , i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film , but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch
i was very disappointed in this dvd it was a dvd for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds the dvd was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details the ability to view details of color and details of wing , tail bands , etc would have offered a much better learning tool it also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations
unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds , this dvd is otherwise a waste of money spend the extra money and buy the life of birds
picasso is one of the giants in the history of art and surely the artistic genious of the 20th century , but this renders him boring and repetitive it was done while he was alive , and has him painting little cartoon like works that were done only for this dvd one after the other ad nauseum this is picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist , not the edgy artist genius of les demoiselles d'avignon and guernica it looks as if he 's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work i turned it off after 30 interminable minutes fortunately i rented it on netflix , which i 'd recommend , rather than buying it
ok , i am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as vampire assassin then i run into another bad movie lets face it , this movie totally blows and what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects \? what was eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie , she was n't even the main star more like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it
this review is based on the differences between the standard dvd disc and the superbit version only based on that , i recommend that you save your money and get the standard version you 'll get more features , while barely losing any audio or video quality , which is the whole reason for buying a superbit disc in the first place i 've watched this movie on my 40 lcd sony xbr bravia \( 720 dpi \) , an oppo upscaling dvd player , and 5 1 sound system , and for this movie , i did n't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version so unless they 're selling this superbit version for 10 bucks or less \( which seems to be the trend since superbit discs may become moot now that hd dvd and blu ray discs are starting to come out \) , i 'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie , which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers
i saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull true story
so disappointing hardly a dark noir film , in my opinion just a proper hollywood murder mystery and there 's no sex , except brief kissing which lana always cuts short ! i'm a james m cain fan , and this does n't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel everyone 's too decent cora \( lana \) does n't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body , and she 's always costumed like a perfect fashion model , fingernail polish and all frank \( garfield \) is never lustful , never mean , never desperate always polite and decent not a gas station \( except for one pump that looks planted \) not a single oil can or wrench not a greasy spoon or diner , twin oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or b b , fit for donna reed family the 80 's nicholson mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark much more faithful to cain
i am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children , though i do not have any of my own on the whole i am unimpressed with the barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves
mission impossible , the tv series , told the adventures of the impossible missions force an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins , foreign dictators , terrorists and others who threatened the security of the united states rather than engage in james bond like shoot outs , the imf team worked together to covertly neutralize threats , leaving little or no trace of their involvement although the imf had a leader \( steven hill as dan briggs and peter graves as jim phelps \) , there was no star of the group just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective a truly groundbreaking show
i just whant to say this , if richard dean anderson is out of the stargate series so am i , and that 's it !
the plot of hard target has been summarized in previous reviews , so i 'll limit myself to discussing my favorite part
action director john woo 's first attempt at making a good american action movie fails with jean claude van damme \( bloodsport , sudden death \) on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars , punches venomous snakes in the head , hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass lance henriksen \( near dark , the terminator \) hey , when isnt henriksen a evil son of a bitatch \? yancy butler \( drop zone \) is van dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and wilfrod brimley \( tv's walker , texas ranger \) plays van damme 's southern fried canjun uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up all in all , it doesnt become the worst movie ever made , its only presence if the style john woo brings to his action scenes his lingo in the art of which he creates also starring arnold vosloo \( the mummy and the mummy returns \) as henriksen 's right hand man ah , gotta love the scene where van damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it ou
i guess i hold the minorty here in thinking the north and south maxie series is just the worst civil war mini series ever put on film they took great source material and turned it into days of our civil war lives , a soap opera of the most unwanted kind i found myself hopeing that maybe it would get better but it got more unbelievible as it went on just a waste of a great cast and a lot of money
given the cast i had high expectations for this movie , but unfortunately it did n't deliver the storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families there are some nice perfomances , granted , and for this reason alone i gave it two stars but even with that grace , it 's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch
what the he77 was that \? \? \? yo i tried cam , your music is straight and all but hang up the camera and pick up the mic stick to your day job \( rapping \)
you asked me to rate my transaction and or the product i ordered the transaction apparently did n't take place , since i did n't receive the dvd that i ordered is that what you wanted to know
a few comments about why i did n't like the video for my daughter
horrible
i actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years i tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in she did a great job , as always , just poor script writing it leaves a lot of questions unanswered , such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms , etc this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point \? i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed
this movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from russian captivity the film covers the experiences of a veteran german officer assigned as an advisor to a rumanian army corps on the eve of the stalingrad encirclement the film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of stalingrad one must think that it even disappointed it 's original german viewers of the 1950 's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of stalingrad and the nazi era
these 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in chinese cinema and definetly for jet li and movie kung fu
a girl buddy movie starring shelley long and bette midler as two women in love with the same guy when they learn that he 's used both of them , they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from new york to new mexico silly and dumb , with the usual chase fare thrown in everything is a cliche , from the opposing personality idea \( long is an orderly goody twoshoes , midler a loudmouthed mess \) to desert hippies to car chases , etc , etc the movie seems to go on endlessly
between the not so below average acting of thomas and biel , the film might have benefited more from a better script , but it did not there was nothing in this movie that they could have done better , it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much
this movie makes me want to vomit watching bio dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people
this movie would have been a complete failure if fred astaire had n't starred in it i found it to be exceptionally dull except for i lost my hat in haiti and you are , and footage from the actual wedding of a member of the british monarchy , this film is pretty terrible
trash film usurps title people that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to this must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old german film
why oh why do they keep placing redneck tim allen in christmas movies \? he ca n't act and he is disgusting i am ashamed at jamie lee curtis for reducing herself to this garbage i can understand tim allen thinking this was a good script , the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book with pictures but i had higher expectations from jamie lee curtis i have to say i usually love her but she was awful in this film she is reduced to whining and crying she does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her tim allen was awful from day one in his redneck middle america sitcom , and to this day retains that disgusting , overweight , burping middle america character
many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege this is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film i too loved this movie at a certain period of my life the period between my birth and when i turned ten that was when i read the book the book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created it has now been awhile since i first read it , but i still remember the excitement i felt with each new chapter i finished it in a few short hours since then , i have reread it several times , and each time it has been just as enjoyable it is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy my brother reads as little as possible , but even he loved it the movie , on the other hand , has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing it deters from the book in almost every way possible it makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting judy garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine , dorothy gale in the book , dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever in the film , she is whiny , cowardly , fretful , and slightly stupid she is also portrayed as being around fifteen making her this old distorts the book and her older age does n't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance besides wrecking the book , this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film do n't misunderstand me , i am a fan of musicals however , this film made for an atrocious musical practically every single song was annoying ! ! ! ! ! also , the somewhere over the rainbow number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book this brings me to the biggest , most awful , distortion of them all ! ! ! in the book , dorothy really went to oz ! ! ! ! ! not only that , she returned to oz several times in other oz books eventually , she even moved there to live ! ! ! in making the whole experience a dream , the entire story of oz was destroyed having said that , this movie receives a 1 in my opinion even so , i realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom if they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book , then the 3 disc dvd is the edition to purchase the features look good and the picture is restored as for me , i will spend my money on better things
not as much tap dancing as the other ones you probaly have to be irish to understand the theme because i did n't
i never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd , i was excited , remembering the magazine from when i was a kid and being a fan of ilc , snl , and comedy itself i am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others do n't i write this review now as i am trying to watch the third disc i got the dvd the first day it came out and i have to watch every dvd i get , even if i saw it before regardless to say , i only broke a smurk once throughout the first 2 1 2 discs i even tried watching parts of the disc when i was having a great day and even when i was not in the greatest of moods i was in a good mood again this morning so i started watching it i think it is the lamest show that i have ever seen i really do n't know why it ever lasted past the first season if you 've seen the show on tv and you like it , more power to you , if you have n't seen it , do n't buy it , it is a waste of money everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny i personaly do n't think i should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny
this is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name i will not even give this one to a student or friend put it in the goodwill bag
or you out of your mind ! i watched about 5 mins and i'm speachless that was the worse movie i ever started to watch and could n't get to the controls fast enough to turn it off throw them away , please
it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the tales from the darkside book the first one is lot 249 with christian slater , julianne moore and steve buscemi , which this one is the best with of course slater 's character then the next one is the cat from hell with william hickey and david johanssen , this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people the last one is a lover 's vow with james remar and rae dawn chong , it starts off good with remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects
do n't buy this junk , it is nothing more than trailers for 50 movies that the makers have deamed as the worst like another review said just look up a list somewere ! !
i love bad movies , so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i 'd give it a try
i found this film accidentially on amazon and was curious because i know welles did n't complete a great deal of films his directorial flourishes are definitely evident , but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer the picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad it looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so i could n't tell whether this was a bad dvd presentation of a mediocre film , or an awful movie put on dvd badly i did not shell out of the criterion edition , which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film
this is a potentially very good film interesting idea \( bearing some resemblance to angel heart \) sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer i do n't think i 've ever bought \( dvd or video \) or seen \( tv or cinema \) quite such an awful copy of a movie it is clearly stuck together from more than one original , with the logo delta appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner , but do n't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version the term special edition seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released ! ! ! ! ! tony curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue \( clearly from some late night cheap tv series \)
i bought orson welles citizen kane and liked it so i decided to watch other welles movies i bought mr arkadin because the dvd is cheap and rated high on imdb i should have buyed touch of evil instead the quality of the picture is laughable , sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes judging by the picture and sound quality i would say that they used equipment from the 30 's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the european movie industry of the 50 's sometimes the picture shake , during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we ca n't read everything the editing is very poor , there are too many scene changes when i bought this dvd i expected to receive the laserlight version , instead i got a dvd made by alpha video the case cover is different and there is no supplemental material he was mastered cheaply on a pc with the spruceup dvd maestro software , that seem to create problems , each time i try to play the disc on my computer the fbi warning message appear and then the disc eject i did n't notice any audio syncing problems however this movie is the perfect candidate for a remake i give for the story and for the overall quality of the movie
the weight of water \( kathryn bigelow , 2000 \)
i bought a copy of ntr for one reason and one reason only a single scene near the beginning , prominently featuring rosanna arquette this was the same reason i bought a copy of the wrong man , starring john lithgow and rosanna arquette discretion prevents my explaining further other than the scene already mentioned , i found the movie pretty worthless
the story is ok , but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much but if your looking for some raunchy sex there is a non simulated oral sex scene in it
added
well , nice cinematography as set designer work nicely interiors and well dressed actors maybe , visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once , but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year , as other reviewers trying to assure
i was so bored by this film that i thought i might be missing some subtle french cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting i asked a younger , french , female friend , who said she found it at least as boring as i did
as i remember when i watched the original chinese version , although it wasnt any big deal but i did like it as i remember , but this version is totally destroy that feeling , something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap , especially some sound effect why do n't they put the original track in it i hard can understand if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me it worth my 3 stars with the original trac
it did n't take me long to forget this film once again it stars jet in a strange role
not a good copy of this great movie i 'd wait and buy the restored authorized edition quot even though i bought this version , i 've ordered the other that 's how much i like metropolis is general
the bad

vol 3 marks a new low for family guy a season that started out strong but ended very oh my god , i was so shocked by that hahahahaha it seems to be riding on it 's laurels , so to speak , and it 's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny i do n't like it , and i think it 's been reduced to recent simpson quality meanwhile , the dvd has a few commentaries \( i 'd like to point out that the competition simpson dvd 's have commentaries on every episode , same with futurama \) some sub par special features the biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single layer , which means four episodes per disc , as opposed to the traditional seven we only get thirteen episodes of crap , and maybe we should be grateful , but all in all , whatever
i 'll get this out of the way i never liked the 80 's slasher films stuff like the halloween series , nightmare on elm street or friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much the idea of slow walking killers going after olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me of course the major draw was the death scenes elaborate moments of viciousness flinging jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it 's a good kind of laughing for some reason
jennifer love hewitt needs to fire her manager i 've yet to see her in a truly good role those terrible know what you did last summer movies , garfield , heartbreakers , if only , and many others were n't exactly memorable roles the truth about love does n't help bump her in that direction either not that i was expecting oscar quality when i looked at the back of the box , seeing a picture of her in a leather corset , i was n't going off of words to know that i was slightly interested in the movie i 've owned it for a few months now , and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and i were in the other room playing games she kept coming out every 5 minutes , and i could tell that she was n't that interested after giving in and watching it with her , i now wish we had all played resident evil 4 instead
when buying a product , you expect a little bang for your buck unlike its counterpart family classics , action classics leaves far short of its mark although these movies are old , you expect quality unfortunately , the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy you 'd think that because they 're on dvd , the quality would be better the movies shown are low budget \( b movies \) with unknown actors and limited action need i continue \? \?
this dvd is pretty bad i 've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the triple feature dvd
heavyweights was a quite a disappointment , considering the presence of ben stiller
the script and dialogue are lousy all this film has to recommend it is a pretty face and occasional scenes depicting flesh the lady is not very interesting to say the least nothing original this is a cookie cutter clone of a thousand other french movies about young women trying sex for the first time avoid
i do not like the format of the dvd at all i had taken several pilates classes before buying this dvd , but i found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end much of pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times , so with no reminder of what i should be doing in each pose i felt like i was being cheated out of a workout i do n't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form , so this dvd will be stored away while i learn the specifics of pilates elsewhere
a friend and i tried watching this film once again recently , but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant from the beginning , when katharine hepburn 's character destroys other people 's cars without a care , we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny the acting is fine , as could be expected from such greats as hepburn and cary grant but the characters are not sympathetic , fun or interesting grant 's character is an unassertive , spineless person who is easily dominated hepburn 's character is blindly selfish who could care what happens to them \? the one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard
let me start off by saying that i am a huge madtv fan and have been for years it is easily my favorite show of all time while i loved the complete season 1 released in 2004 , i think this dvd set is terrible why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent , and arguably the worst , seasons makes no sense to me of course this does have some classic sketches , impressions and characters on it , such as debra wilson 's oprah and mo collins' lorraine , but a majority of it is just random most of these sketches are n't some of the better ones who picked this list \?
i really enjoyed season 1 but from the look of this we 're never going to see other complete seasons released why release the best of seasons 8 , 9 , 10 when you 've never released the complete seasons \? what about complete seasons 2 , 3 , 4 , etc cabana chat with rodney dangerfield \? phil lamarr 's impressions of michael jackson , prince \? little hassan taylor 's greatest hits \? darlene mcbride \? vancome halloween \? the wash me video parody of alanis morissette \? lick my baby back behind video parody of britney spears \? the love muffin video parody of mariah carey \? the bush cheney rap video parody the ubs man goes to the video rental shop , etc \? afropuffs cereal \? the early madtv was a little savage at times but that 's what made it funny i feel it 's appropriate to issue the best after you 've put out the complete seasons of course maybe there were legal problems some of the humor was pretty savage ! i guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own

this is a movie directed and played by a guy with unsalvageable narcissus complex always dreamed himself as a modern day casanova in n y , just like that george kastansa character in 'seifield' , a big lover , a womanizer , a baldy forever young romeo almost all of the screenplays he wrote , the movies he directed , the characters he played were all like this i just do n't know how women would fall for him in the least sense and possibility , only if in his wet dreams this is a very nauseating movie all of his movies are almost the same , only the movie titles changed the only one i liked is his recent 'match point' , nothing else and i felt lucky this guy was too old to play that role now , otherwise , he would n't allow anyone else to play that ambitious murderer but him
i expected so much more , because it 's marshall , but regardless of where you purchase this , it's edited it 's pathetic this is eminem ! i understand you have a daughter mr mathers , but do not make all of us watch an edited concert this is probably the most ridiculous thing i 've ever bought there 's not even a warning that it 's censored you just buy it , pop it in your dvd player , and listen to a concert with mostly every other word jarbled up it 's a useless dvd there 's no point in buying it first encore , now this i 've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90 's as somebody from michigan , i saw him before he was mr cartier global super star buying skin treatments at barneys i 've never been more disappointed with an artist
i went and saw another film as i was so disenchanted with this one the opening had so little to do with the rest of the film i thought i was watching a preview to another film i do n't care for spoofs about catholics and protestants the pythons ca n't sing or dance \( for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable \) i say to the fans of python get a life
unfortunately they just do not get off the ground python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge regrettably they missed the mark on this one one or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it
not my type of humor i think i'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining
i'm sorry folks , but i went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen it would be a tremendous understatement to say i was disappointed this film is horrible in nearly every respect , but this is the film 's fatal flaw a character study is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature
this dvd has a very bad image and sound altought it is a good movie , i do n't recomend it if you are looking for a charles bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction no menu , no subtitles , no chapter selection i wished i did not buy it
the gauntlet may rank as one of clint eastwood 's worst movies it is so unrealistic and silly i frankly did n't want to even finish it released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and dirty harry movies , it stands out as being a real stinker
what a rip off ! this is my very first bad experience with amazon heck , this is the first time i have n't been extremely satisfied
i had to contact amazon five times about this item i ordered it on 10 1 and it did n't ship for several weeks then when i check my account , the description had changed to umd for psp you will not get the dvd if you order this i eventually cancelled mine amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and does n't seem too worried about correcting this do not order
i am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one this is not the dvd version of the film however , on all the links to it , it says dvd when i received the item in the mail , amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return , and even told me that they would send the dvd version of the film nonetheless , two days later , i received the same psp version again
i was thrilled when i saw there was a new sesame street christmas dvd out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized and , as much as i enjoy being a sesame street kid \( 37 , just like the show \) , i was tiring of the same stuff over and over
i ca n't imagine why madonna , janet jackson , or michael jackson 's vma performances were not included in this dvd the most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded i do n't understand it is a travesty i hope mtv releases more of the vma performances with madonna , janet , and michael i 'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of vma performances
i have to say , this show did not turn me on at all i like twisted humor and a good puppet show
both sides of disc 5 are unplayable all others are o
starring tony perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer what can you say \? the red sox have jimmy pirsall , tony perkins and fear strikes out the yankees have lou gehrig , gary cooper and pride of the yankees
i just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a hollywood film \( the departed \) i can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie after watching this movie i turned to my wife and said , this movie would have been great if it would have stared someone anyone with an ounce of talent ! the acting is very affected and self conscious understand that 's how hong kong mega stars always act \( its a sort of us 1930 's throwback style \) i really , really despise us film remakes but martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline i would suggest watching the us version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new found intrigue ps i have not yet seen the departed , but i am assuming that it is a much better version than this however come on america , we have plenty of creative writers out there , ca n't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots
i love tng , ds9 , and i even quite like a few of the characters in enterprise but i hate voyager why \? one simple reason janeway i cant stand her she makes me want to puke she has only two personas in the entire 7 year series and she constantly alternates between them , and they are both nauseating first , vomit inducing compassion face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper two , tough chick face in which she puts on a hard chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable god she nauseates me the same thing happened with maggie thatcher the one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything unlike kirk , picard , sisko and even archer , janeway has no charisma at all yuck but shes not the only one , this has got to be the only star trek series in which no matter how hard i tried i could never develop any attachment to the characters they 're all boring only paris has any appeal and even then not much i watched the first 3 seasons hoping i would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up years later i finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years no the same old nauseating janeway , same old boring episodes , spewing over with self righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality' and this series is the most mushy , sentimental crap of all the star trek series there is barely an episode that is not cringe inducing in its emotional mushyness the only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'q2' episode and that was only because q was in it \( and they even turned that into a morality play \) , and the very end of 'renaissance man' when the doctor tells harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded targ good riddance voyager , and especially good riddance janeway
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly , this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak \( acting \) rendition of the story thankfully , it is word for word from the bible , which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation
the only other ff material i 've see is the movie and i did n't play any of the games yet so i'm not basing this review on that after watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1 2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked
if you 're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill , this is not the video for you however , if you want a training video on big wave surfing , go ahead a better video for the stoke would be the classic endless summer 2 much more of a better buy billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in odyssey about tow in surfing , training on watercrafts , and then they get to the surfing i fell asleep throughout the 2 3 of it i had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing nice documentary for discovery channel , not for the wired surf enthusiast so
i ca n't even begin to tell how bad this movie is it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along i sold this one the day after i bought it
this is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy something liberals like to impose on others
royal wedding is n't on dvd yet that 's because the owner of the film , warner bros has n't released it yet
every store should have a dvd shredder for movies that suck rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away adding darryl hannah and denise richards to an already horrible story line just to sell dvds is a disgrace trying to do 80 's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one save your time , money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video
flat lighting , cheap sets and costumes , dull dialog , wooden acting , and a goofy plot even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie zero stars should be an option for more inspired soft porn , check out the work of andrew blake \( andrewblake com \)
i have to agree with most of the other reviews this movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling i have found myself watching it over and over again i would rate the film as five stars unfortunately , i can not buy the dvd because the cheapskates at warner have only released this in butchered full screen format as such , i can only rate this dvd as two stars and certainly no stars for warner
our family has an embarassingly large collection of elmo and sesame street dvds , so i speak from experience i found this production to be way below par my 2 1 2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe 10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do play doh instead the plot if poorly contrived , the production value is low , the acting for the most part is awful , and it 's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age , my son has no interest in he did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer but i'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip better bets a celebration of me , grover or sesame street the street we live on
i just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter i was disappointed with the 4 dollars i spent on it for that it is more like a music video than a story the segments are of adults , no children singing or playing and the story line is n't much sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there was n't anything educational about this video and i am so glad i did n't buy it i really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now i'm sorry that we did even that stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy i hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were
all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well , there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies , never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why , i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end
did anyone else watch the same movie that i did \? or should i say try to watch the same movie that i did \? i am a huge classic sci fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one i was mislead i can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie in fact , i am sure that carpenter and o'bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past the unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring the 'effects' do n't exist , and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing it 's not funny it is embarassing i could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage
yes !
how sad and pathetic this concert is i loved the dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy after seeing how good the stooges reunion concert was i was hoping for more of the same wrong ! ! it becomes painfully clear from the start that johanssen in particular is phoning it in low point of the show is when they make human being one of the greatest rock n roll songs ever a sing a long give me a break ! ! ! !
this is one bad movies i am a devout horror fan , but i was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie the acting is worse than bad , it 's a joke the plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous save your money even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive there is no humor , no likable characters , not even a decent quote or one liner by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion , you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back so save yourself disappointment and keep looking , this movie is the biggest bomb , i have stumnbled across in years
i have to say i had no expectations going into this movie , i watched it with an open mind , ready for anything what i got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to wales , but also made me want to wail for hours because it was a waste of time i am just confused about the whole thing really , the plot the characters the ending i see other reviews on here about how creepy it was , and i just did n't feel that what i felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by maria bello \( who i have never thought had a face or talent for acting \) what they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane , where the dead go , and we can get the dead back if we give something living the daughter is whisked away like penelope taken to hades but with much less interesting results the mother and father , now have to take care of a displaced spirit child , her haunted freaky father , and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice ikea blanket for me are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter , goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na ve and gullible local folks \? \( who worships in an abattoir \? c'mon people \) none of these folds deserved children , much less a ghost one so when the mother realizes that she sucks , and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care i did n't really care , i was thinking the girl was much better off i was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it , what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father , because her daughter asked her too \? um , maybe what 's wrong in this family is that no one communicates ! ! ! ! ! oh , wait , they all flipping know morse code so that 's enough \? ! \? ! there are n't any genuine scares , and sheep with glowing eyes are n't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it the ending , both of them , did n't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together , it felt rushed i do n't understand hollywood 's obsession right now with creepy children , it 's an echo of the days of the bad seed and the omen but not homage , more like terrible copycats with no oomph so see this movie if you like sean bean , he is the only good thing about it , other than that see it to cheer when maria bello hurls herself off a cliff
\( 1 \) scarlett o'hara is the least likable heroine i 've ever seen she has no redeeming qualities
ignore the blurb on the vhs box , the movie is not about a couple 's hot parties with hip friends , it is about a couple 's awful parties with jerk friends now , that might not be a bad thing in fact , i think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones but the advertising is dishonest
this should have been better but angela bassett 's performance was the best , so i guess it 's worth a watch
others have already described the movie so i shall not repeat what has already said
i purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that i'm designing boy was i dissapointed !
unfortunately , i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which , of course , does n't function on a european system , despite my adress beeing in switzerland so i was kind of disapointed to have a \) lost the money b \) not been able to watch the movie one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player
i like pauley shore i have seen him in other movies that i liked so i made the mistake of buying the jury duty video because i liked in the army now and bio dome and assumed i would like this too , well i learned my lesson well and i learned it the hard way and wasted my money and i have learned to never assume i will like a movie because i liked the actor in another movie and from now on i will rent the movie first ! jury duty simply was just plain awful with it 's weak , boring plot and unfunny humor ! in the army now and bio dome were a lot funnier , and if you want to kick back , relax and laugh your backside off than watch those movies
hey genius good job ruining the end of the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it like , say , my five year old and eight year old children it's a miracle if i can even get them to sit still for five minutes , and now that they know the ending to this film , there's no way they're ever going to agree to go to bed tonight thanks a bunch ever heard of the internet before \? you must be a first time user
here we go again another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots the differences between season 3 and this drivel are staggering
first off , let me explain why i purchased the around the world in 80 days dvd in the first place , sight unseen one , i was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950 's as i could on dvd , to add to my personal library two , it was the winner of the 1956 best picture oscar \( how bad could it be , right \? \) and third , it was on sale at my local wholesaler so i figured , what the hey , i 'll take a chance
this final season is just ridiculous and not in a good way
when shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang but saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks now dont get me wrong , it was funny , i 'll give it that , that 's the only reason it got 2 stars , but season 1 4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure in living color wise so i 'd recomend this for the series collectors like me meaning i have season 1 4 and although i didnt like season 5 , i 'd feel uncomplete without it
this is a wonderful film some may say it 's a bit slow paced and perhaps it 's not geared for the mtv generation 's pace of visual stimulation nonetheless , patience has it 's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance it appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director , tati unfortunately , the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft , as though the telecine was not in focus it 's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care one only hopes that a dvd transfer of superior quality is in the pipes
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly , this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak \( acting \) rendition of the story thankfully , it is word for word from the bible , which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation
i did watch that and i did not liked cause i know good detailed information about this history this dvd is making polishing boeing company instead lockheed won this techonology war ! it is 2 hours long and boeing appears most of the times there is no good explanation how lockheed is performed that outstanding job it all talkes about boeing and at the final it again declares boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs i think the director was from boeing compan
i do n't know what to say about this it was interesting but not wowing by any standards it was semi enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too but the music sucks and thats half the dvd right there recommend renting or borrowing from a friend i would n't buy this dvd again
ok , i 'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn this film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon it really does n't take a genius to figure out this plot i mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room i turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film 's plot and sure enough i was right on the money , only i thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no , it had to keep going and going just end allready , i get it !
i am a big fan of martial arts films having lived in taiwan however , this one was over hyped in my opinion the love affairs in the dvd were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times i often enjoy the melodrama and over acting of chinese films , but i gagged a few times on this one it was down right goofy at times i really wanted this one to grab me , but it did not
while it may be true that the camera does n't lie , when you take 600 hours of footage and edit them down to 6 , you have a lot of leaway to manipulate immediately after finishing the film , i would have given this movie 4 stars it 's very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes after we finished watching it , however , we wanted to know more , so we started gathering information from other sources very quickly , we discovered that we had been conned jean xavier de lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story , and he crafted the footage to tell that story unfortunately , it does n't appear to be the real story we felt so betrayed we 'd spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown \( much less explained \) and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation if you want to see a well made film that will keep you amazed and guessing , definitely see this film if you want to see something that reflects reality , i would look elsewhere
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
this was a defective unit got new unit and it works as expected
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord if you do n't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all
pluged it in and good to go , i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen , a little overwhelmed with all the features , it could be more stremlined , for a novice user they would be entirely lost , perhaps that is whats on the install disk \( easier setup \) , but my experience self , got through just fine , enabled the maximum security features \( more so then the easy setup button , which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments \)
i'm glad that i bought the carry case with my garmin etrex , because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry i have n't used the belt clip yet , but i liked that option
after reading the online reviews of this product vs the portable product i went with this one portability is not much of a need , i plan on being around a power outlet the sound is in line with a radio boom box of the same size and it 's about the same weight i have a lot of trees around my house so i have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit i have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and i can hear it all over the first floor of my home so far i'm happy that i bought it
i was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system i purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased you can hear the music in several other rooms if the volume is turned up , without distortion
this case is a veritable dirt magnet it attracts more lint than i ever knew existed on my desk however , it protects very well one thing i was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen however , it does n't even touch the ipod also i worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel while it is n't quite as sensitive , it makes it more precise in my opinion , seeing as how i all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when i wanted in the s range without the case on this blue case even looks good on my black ipod , even though i was worried the color would appear muted it 's still vibrant
printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is , cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i'm fine with that
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago one handset gave us problems from the start , but was promptly replaced when returned for service the system works fine in our 2 story , 2 , 300 sq ft home i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street i like the features , including paging system , call transfer , and handset speakerphone being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus i think the sound quality is very good , and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag
i bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it ! it has great sound quality i love the features it has such as speakerphone , caller id , and it 's phone directory the only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice into both directories oher than that , this is a great phone i have owned panasonic and ge cordless phones in the past and had problems i even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late
this fm transmitter is the bomb diggiti ! !
on the plus side , it 's a great value for the games that do work on the t5 simcity alone is probably worth the price
hp premium plus photo paper is the only way to go if you desire tremendous photos from your home printer without any scratching , scuffing or blemishes i have tried less expensive paper from hp as well as other manufacturers the difference in quality is obvious if you want friends and family to think you know what you are doing , share photo 's on hp premium plus glossy paper
excelent , hard drive , good price and good time for seller
i ordered one from an amazon partner for 01 plus shipping , then with my a9 discount the price was even lower so i got one for less than the shipping cost true , the seller made a little on the shipping maybe 4 50 not counting time think how much apple must be making ! the packaging did n't mention nano so with a bit of trepidation i plugged it into the wall and my ipod and my nano liked it ! charging happened it must have been made before the nano came out as other reviewers have said , buy this one and avoid a high price elsewhere
i purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go the case holds the gps , mount and all the different cables the foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or without the velcro staps hold the mount the ac cord this way when you are looking for it , everthing is in one place the case is made well and very plain looking on the outside , so not to draw any attention
very easy to set up , great product picture is great on my samsung 50 inch plasma
it is a pleasure to use this dvd player the quality of the image is superb it upgrades definition on dvds and the difference is very \( favorably \) noticed as compared to that obtaibed from a less than a year old sony player \( with hdmi \) , the difference in image quality absolutely huge
i had a problem with my sunrocket voip and i read that someone had bought this modem and that it solved her problem i gave it a shot and guess what no more dropped calls thank you motorola ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally , the dvi d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a dvi d cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few \( very few \) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of hdmi , nobody really makes them anymore
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand
i am not really a big tech person so i do n't have the mega system hooked up to my computer and dvd tv but i do know that since i got this i have been blasting my music like crazy i do n't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because i have enough space down there and all i have to is lean down anyway i personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud \( considering its computer speakers \) i do n't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when i'm in the shower so i am pretty much happy with them
these speakers are amazing , i am truly shocked to receive something so sweet at an unbelievable price , amazon thank you for the hook up , my speaker system rocks my delivery experience with amazon was great ca n't thank you enough , keep up the great service , truly
i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers , but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks , creatures , or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop , i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max \( yes i underestimated these speakers \) when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume , and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk !
the camera is perfect if using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you the picture is clear not to grainy the only heads up is lighting try to use the camera in a well light area we are stationed in japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home the camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick the best part is the price wo n't break the bank
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon 's free shipping option , but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma mp780 \( that i also bought from amazon \) most of my printing is borderless 8 1 2x11 and the quality is always great definitely worth it if turnaround time is a problem , buy two so you always have a spare
gave as a gift excellent value tune capacity more than sufficient , easy to use and sound quality is right up there must get one for myself
outstanding product as you would expect from panasonic incoming calls loud and clear the scroll telephone directory is convenient and easy to use i do not like the beep sound when the hand set is placed back in the cradle \( it cannot be turned off
i often have problems with memorex brand but have never had a problem with verbati
i do n't think i would have used my i5 without this i just wish it came with the gps instead of having to buy it separately great to easily move my gps from car to car highly recommend
a great solution to theft prevention for this gps the legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box
the reader is fast example i took 56 2mp images from my camera recently i plugged this reader into my g4 , plugged in the card , the card mounted , i dragged the images to my pictures folder , and they copied immediately no waiting i was amazed , because with my mia usb reader , it could take a while to transfer that many images , over a minute a copy dialog did n't even pop up , because it transferred so fast it does n't hurt that it 's a cutie too 5 stars
it 's a canon product made for another canon product how can you go wrong \?
good printer ink , always try to use factory ink and these are with a good price i bought all the colors and paper at the same time all good price and free shipping save gas driving to local stores
operation of the sony dvpnss550 b single disc dvd player has been straight forward picture quality is very good , and the desired basic features have functioned without problems in other words , in the 2 1 2 months since we have owned this player , quality and reliability have been high price too was very reasonable that means durability is the last quality to consider , which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years but we wo n't know that for years
these mini cd rs work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only 42 cents apiece
this is a great multi function printer scanner copier fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload
as long as i own a pair of these headphones , i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again they sound perfect i cannot fathom a more balanced , natural sound these babies put you in the recording studio , or in the concert hall ! bass is crisp , taut , and strong you can feel it yet it is not overbearing or boomy midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist , and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes the folding feature is handy
good sound for the price , and very durable discrete design i prefer the plug design to other headphones they do n't fall out , and i can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane , it makes almost no difference just be careful in the traffic \)
these earphones are excellent quality noise that gets in from outside is so low that i can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me in addition , the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones
i just got my nano last week and the minute i turned it on \( before even transfering any music to it \) i could hear a faint noise buzz from the nano it comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as i turn off the unit has anyone experienced this with theirs \? my first generation nano does not experience this noise i plan to take it to an apple store and try to get a replacement
i have never been a fan of the ipod i have been an iriver h120 , h320 , and h340 owner i had a toshiba gigabeat and currently own an archos av500 the reason for owning a nano is because of the size of the av500 it is too big to pack around unless i am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on the nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote , \( soon \) , i am very happy with it it loads from itunes very easily and i have had no problems with it not playing certain files , \( and i would reencode them if there was a problem \) apple , do n't let me down
the koss pro 4aa 's were not made for ipod mp3 headphone users to begin with , they reveal the low fidelity of mp3 files \( compared with lp 's or cd 's \) also , they require a 1 4 to 3 5mm \( or other \) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment
bought this mouse over 3 months ago , and its still going strong the batteries last forever \( i 've never replaced them yet \) my only problem is that at times , i will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom , but it wo n't seem to turn off ! i reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again , and this always does the trick other than that , very ergonomic , extremely smooth and precise
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop the usb just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse , i ca n't
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well
my first purchase of the q9b resulted in a return as the display was n't mounted properly within the plastic housing this resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1 4 and made the viewing unpleasant the screen also was n't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100 having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it suffice to say , quality control missed this one
you idiot , its not only for psps the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot phones cameras psp tvs computers
after ordering non oem inks from several different places on the web \( and having some problems with them \) , i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices
hp did n't make 13x19 paper when i bought my 13x19 hp printer way to go , hp they may make it now , but i never check , b c i'm totally satisifed w this paper runs smooth and looks great
product was as described reception was strong and weak depending on your location was able to receive all frequencies rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy could get annoying on a very windy day radio is bulky and heavy
i have used gps units from cobra , garmin , and lowrance i consider this cobra unit to be one of the best i started with the cobra but it was stolen after a month then i bought the lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the cobra i returned the lowrance and bought the garmin 340
the unit operates as good as any other gps system available , plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches i am very impressed with the gps , but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed the unit falls off the window and from the dash , plus the power cord comes out too easily the unit deserves a five star rating , but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 , 2005 businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article
if money was no object , i would prefer the totally wireless headset phone , however , this has been a great alternative i have tmj , and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck , while holding my toddler , while preparing dinner , compound my pain go figure ! i find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain , but , the product works great i have had no problems hearing anyone , nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me the earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off , even for someone with elfishly small ears like me !
i 've owned this headphone for about a year now , and i 've got to say , after going through multiple headphones , this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke \( i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon \) , i 'll surely buy another one again !
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer i have w2k at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2 never had any type of compatibility issue this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon
i am very pleased with the quality of the product i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters after the rebate , the price was very competitive
hey , do n't listen to those other schmucks so maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable , but the rest just complain too much i love this thing ! i got it for christmas , and now for 20 , you ca n't beat that i use a standard charger for it in my car , so i never have to worry about batteries it seems that the best way to get it to sound the best , is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using \( equalizer \) i have also used it on my portable dvd player in the car and it sounds awesome ! for the price , i highly recommend this product
i 've used the keyboard mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish of course , any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard mouse setup , but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish
i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish \( odd , i know \) , i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively inexpensive this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch , in quality , my larger studio size headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone , rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case , means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games 5 stars
after buying my ipod , i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock , which is about 300 , your better off only spending about 25 and getting just as good quality
i was unsure at first if this product would work with my ipod nano , but after checking out griffin 's website , i decided to go ahead and order it it works great ! i like to play solitaire and read text files on my nano , so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if i did n't use the screen so much tunejuice means i do n't ever have to worry about that again i just keep a couple of 9v batteries with me , and i can keep listening , playing , reading or whatever on my nano as long as i want love it
i have been using my sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures i have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i did n't want to spend the money on this either , but it is better i really do n't know why , but it is no question about it perfect picture and sound ! i have a yamaha rx v2700 receiver which has hdmi hookups i tried a hdmi cable that came with my directv box \( from my toshiba hd dvd player \) and it was seriously lacking this hookup is much better ! i have a monster cable hdmi hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my sony 46 flat panel as well \( more but \) i'm finally satisfied i'm watching \( and listening to \) batman begins \( in true hd sound \) on hd dvd and it is superb ! ! ! ! this is just awesome ! the stuff of fantasy you only have to buy this these cables once , so why not buy the best \? ! i highly recommend this move
this remote will do everything you need or want simple to use and great customer service i had a couple of glitches \( buttons that did n't work quite right \) when i first programmed the device , but the harmony support team helped me through those areas the changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the harmony web site so if i ever need to , all i have to do is reload the info
i paid about a dollar for this holder holds and protects the ipaq nicely can hold some credit cards as well as id overall a decent product for a low price
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop it 's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks i have been pleased with apc products for about six years they provide excellent customer support i highly recommend their products
it also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time i 've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle \( out of two that come with it \) still looks almost full if the price was a little more consumer friendly i 'd give it five stars i mean come on when you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50 pack of cd r 's for less than 14 , the profit margin on something like this is probably 200 or more
i found this keyboard to be very helpful i am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers while my laptop can be used to type , when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable this keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing the bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if i would like without stopping the connection i would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it overall , a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier
i had it now for 12 months and no problems with it its tiny lightweight and great speed my old computer has to work quite hard to recognize it , but my laptop has no problems
have been using them for a week now
excellent sound , much much much better that the one that comes with any players , zens or ipod
i just recently move from dial up to dsl going dsl was not enough i did not want to have cables running though the house so i started looking into going wireless to make a long story short , after a little investigation i decided to make the leap into wireless technology i purchased the wap55ag router and the adapter cards , wmp55ag and wpc55ag
i am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone it looks good , but more importantly , it feels good button placement , weight , smoothness , everything was done well coming from wired mice , the lack of a wire is very freeing i am also especially happy with how small the usb radio receiver is i am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is
received this speaker as a replacement for the advent aw 810 which did not work at all this one was much easier to install and calibrate ! very happy with range and sound quality highly recommended
these are very comfortable to wear , and the sound is great i use them out jogging , and they stay put , without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise , so be careful around traffic , as you cannot hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone
i bought these ear headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club the sound quality is acceptable , not exceptional the construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right that places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out i have no idea why sony thought that this was a good design for the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord i would give these a b good not great
the logitech cordless trackman wheel was purchased in sept 2006 i have had this for two months at the time this review is being written
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer it works just as well as the corded one when i'm in my office for travel , the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel it 's not a small , usb stick that goes in the back it 's a long , corded , mouse looking device that sends recieves the signal to the trackman i do n't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel all that said , i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
my canon 510 got glowing reviews just about across the board , but not this printer i have very little space , and needed something small just for photos so , even though there were many negative reviews i went ahead and bought it could n't be happier ! colour fabulous ! and when you print on stock paper you can use photo to do some extra artwork on i love it
product nicely made , looks like quality product and performs fine
my wife and i used the fr300 during the week long queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered one 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume the cell phone charger is cool , but it takes a lot of winding the light is good in a pinch , but not particularly useful
this map set met all my expectations , and was far more current than i had expected software for turn by turn directions on roadways while driving works great with the garmin ctrex gps recommended to load many states you will need large memory card , 1 gb
if you buy this service plan , print out the contract and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan , but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it
easy enough to pop off the normal ant \( roadmate 700 \) and pop on this magmount version and what a difference it made ! signals really are remarkedly improved highly suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you 'll get the birds
a lot cheaper than model specific docking stations , and 'does what it says on the tin' quite stylish too , as docking stations go
we used the gtx600vp4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling the 5 watt power gave us ample range does it reach 18 or 20 miles , do n't know but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains it 's a great way to stay in touch when traveling the batteries are rechargeable , both a c d c the ear pieces were very good for privacy very easy to use and well worth the price a good investment
i was hesitant to get this , since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception now that i bought it , i'm very glad i have it it does all the things you might want in a disaster , inluding a flashlight , red flashing light \( especially if your car breaks down at night \) , a siren \( if you 're trapped in a building \) , ac , battery , and crank power , and multiple radio bands while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations , in a disaster , you only need a few stations , as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news between the am , fm , tv , and noaa bands , my radio will received a huge number of stations many more than would ever be needed in a disaster \( i did n't try the cellphone charging function \) it comes in a carrying case
i just recieved my hdmi cable and am very impressed the price is just what it should be about 5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over 100 for this cable at a store the service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days ! i highly recommend this cable i just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the tv and wow what a great picture all around the color is just so much more vivid using hdmi compared to component 3 wire connectors get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others
this is the perfect keyboard \( i know cuz i am typing on it right now \) i recommend if you like media boards
sandisk has done it again they never seem to let me down with their products i was in the market for another memory chip since i kept filling up my smaller 128 mb chip the price was the deciding factor for me , as being a college student the financial situation was tight but this product was perfect , right price , excellecnt storage space , good name get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
fast shipping , very happy with the garmin their tech support is good they answer all questions will buy from amazon again will buy a garmin agai
this is great ! my only problem is the knob for adjusting it 's to loose
i bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a 9 99 mouse , and i 'll never turn back this mouse is outstanding for gaming it 's pretty damned accurate , and it easily fits in my hand good price , too
i you own a smartphone , you 'll need one of these also happy this came with an adapter card , to plug in the microsd into it to move data from my mac to the phone
the sandisk 1gb micro sd card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging i installed it in my motorala razr v3m as expanded memory for my music library be sure to remove the razr battery to clear the access slot for the micro sd the v3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems i used motorola phone tools to transfer my entire music library the program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer the entire music library a full 1gb transferred reasonably quickly the v3m is slow to access my music using menu function 3 under get tunes tones function 6 manage music accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well the new corded motorola syn1301b stereo earbuds work well in this configuration sound quality is surprisingly good , but the large diameter earbuds are flat not tapered and do not seat very well in the ear canal the sandisk 1gb microsd card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the v3m as cell phone with mp3 player
i upgraded from some speakers i purchased when i built my system the sound difference was wonderful it is a clean crisp fresh sound worth every penny
pros
okay so it was about 8 45 at night i was coming on to a 1 2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live i was doing 60mph , the speed limit is 40 as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small k band warning i instantly slow down to the speed limit as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph then it gets to full k band i look to my left where there is a service parking area , and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car as i pass the police car , i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead
this is my second escort passport 8500 x50 the first one is in another car it saved me many times for getting caught though i'm not maniac driver the detection range is very good , it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car i love the blue color and it only costs 30 more than red the only problem that i have experienced on my first one is sometimes i got laser false warning signals , especially on raining day with defog is on i heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes x50 pop and laser false warning signals , and my first x50 is in my turbo charged car i'm not sure if pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much , i have it turned off overall , it 's very good detector , you will get payback if you own one
the best headphones i ever had , good fit excellent sound on my soundblaster x fi ! !
i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below \( followed exactly \) there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase , i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 , this is what worked for me at any rate
works with ipod skin , no need to take off cover looks good has connections for audio , tv cables and remote are additional included are 5 adapters for all ipods that have doc connector
this is a great storage device i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse i love the lanyard , that helps me to keep track of the drive worth every i paid for it !
this is a very nice set of paper and envelopes the price is really great the paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double the colors come out very bright and the folding is easy overall it is a good deal
i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my 2 4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone , i can contact her to talk to her
i am extremely pleased with the purchase i am using it in my office simple plug and play \( no brainer \) ! !
like most other reviews , i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit movies are amazing ! my music collection never sounded so good if you want to get away from it all for awhile , slip these babies in your ears and chill
i bought usb rudder pedals and yoke for use with x plane on a mac dual g5
i needed a simple solution for my office i wanted to be able to use the phone , but not get tied down by the handset , or the headset here was my solution , since the ts105b has the 2 5mm port for a headset , i purchased a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office so far wow ! ! ! its worked out great the phone is also good by itself , plus it was inexpensive through amazon for anyone interested in going the route i took you will not be disappointed
i have had this tv since mid march 2006 i absolutley love it ! ! i did extensive research before i bought a large screen tv and found that this samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck i read some reviews saying that dlp technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect , especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action one reviewer specifically said to try playing bourne supremecy to see an example of the rainbow effect this was the first dvd i played on this tv and i did not once have a problem with rainbow effect overall i have no complaints with this tv samsung has produced an excellent product i recommend either satellite or hd programming for the best picture regular cable comes in sort of grainy
there is a little story before this
this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag , and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset , ie turn off the headset , receiver and ipod all from the headset instead , i have to get the ipod back out , turn it off , turn the receiver off , then turn the headset off
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon , and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair \( took about 10 minutes to do , let it cure overnight \) headphones look ok , with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards \( reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses \) sound is very good \( better than most earbuds \) , they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever , and range is outstanding my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on , and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco , and they are only partially functional with the nano \( ca n't use the advance track feature of the headphones \)
i am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from case logic this is a great product and is manufactured well holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out i do n't transport them so i ca n't comment on that like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up get this if you need a lot of storage
this headphone extension is perfect ! it is not as long as described \( about 15 feet \) but that 's o k with me the connections are tight \( the plugs do n't pull apart \) it maintains sonic quality it also retains it 's elasticity using this extension cord my grado sr 60 's sound better than any wireless phones you wo n't be dissapointed !
this is a pretty decent cheapo case if you want something that you 'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs , then you may want to get something a little sturdier for my archival purposes , however , it works just fine
purchase service
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
this was by far the easiest computer peripheral i have ever setup ! works flawlessly with my netgear wireless router
it is remarkable that , even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence , none of them are near perfect i tried four different cases , both hard plastic and silicone variants , and the iskin case comes the closest , protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days love the service at amazon
these are the best period ! look no further because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes after 3 conversations with canon customer care , we decided it was not the printer , but the cheaper ink i switched back to canon , bit the bullet on the price , and everything is fine i found decent prices on amazon , particularly at eek industries
this is a nifty very small musical device that i use when exercising its great holds all the songs i can listen to and is so portable i really like i
i was so happy with my creative zen nano that i bought one as a gift i love the color choice and the sound is great love the pause button it came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band you do not need to buy one ! ! amazon delivered it in 2 days
this printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrived
this is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality
i'm using monster optical cable as well , but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf
sound quality is very good , and i have n't run out of battery so far the base is somewhat smaller than what i expected from the pictures the handsets are well designed on my previous phone it happened that the mute function became engaged when i kept the phone between my head and my shoulders this did not happen with these so far speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages answering machine works well easy to copy phonebook entries between phones
this does exactly what it is supposed to do it is light , easy to pack , easy to use , and probably difficult to crack
i tried both microsoft 's lifecam vx 3000 and vx 6000 had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core 3 00ghz cpu with 2 gigs of ram and , with both of those , the video lagged the audio \( distractingly so \) spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening \( got through on their toll free line \) and he pointed me to new software for the vx 6000 downloaded the 50 meg plus file , installed it , but the vx 6000 still produced out of sync video vs audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker
easy to operate and good focus just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
garmin ique m5
we bought this about a month ago from amazon the product itself seems fine we used it on a vacation drive from nj to myrtle beach and back at times , it was a help \( like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in va and we needed an alternate route \) however , you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it does n't always recommend the best or shortest route also , it was missing certain stores , restaurants , etc that had been around for awhile
this phone was an additional phone for the model ip811 2 phone system used for vonage this system has every feature that i could want , including range and quality , there are no negatives i am highly recommending this phone and system
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture you would n't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing i have shown it to an i pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the i pod
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap 76s to my hp laptop so far it has performed perfectly i have not tried to use it for other applications yet , so i ca n't comment on how well it would work in other situations
i find this printer to be better than hp or epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles , just a solid printer that performs as i anticipated
the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice , i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me
i bought four of these so far they appear to work well they do not work with compact flourescent lights well , but are fine with incandescent bulbs
i bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17 hyundai l90d \( which is a great low priced screen for gaming \) , which was the replacement for a dell fp2100 \( that i gave to my wife \) anyways , this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times \( more than enough for my flight sims \) movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution has n't been a problem the design is probably the neatest looking out there \( subjective i realize \) the only gripe i have w this monitor is lack of swivel \( sigh \) other than that i'm very pleased with everything about this screen
wow just got one of these at a great price , hooked it up to my mac g4 via a dvid cable , and it boots up at native resolution \( 1680 x 1050 \) automatically no muss , no fuss text is crisp and clean
my favorite thing about this phone is that the caller id captures 11 digit numbers \( 1 xxx xxx xxxx \) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call my old phone only captured 10 digits \( xxx xxx xxxx \) which meant i had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first this new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number i put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in very handy as far as being a phone , it does everything well and after a couple of months i am still as happy as could be with it
this is the rockinest think i 've ever seen or buyed dudes ! ! ! check it ou
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking , hiking , kayaking , and in the car to i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
ok here 's the deal i 've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years i love my magellan i 've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface \( the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me \) and how the menu structure was built
i had been talking about wanting an mp3 player , but i did not want an ipod , as i heard you cannot add files in windows format and that 's what all of my music is i received this e260 4 gb mp3 player for my birthday in june 2006 , and this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned although there are a few little quirks , overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this mp3 player
pros easy to use , last for days without charging \( depending on the use , of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging , and it lasted the trip \) , enough memory space , has radio , works as a recorder , small
i 've never written a review , but i 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other amazon buyers , so i felt a really good product like the anycom bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review
i was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer the photo output is awesome and it 's very fast !
i'm a skeptic no , i mean i'm really a skeptic especially in today 's marketplace \( because nothing is built like it used to be \) i do n't buy anything without checking it out first , and even then , i expect that it 's probably going to fail me when i do yeah , wonderful view there , huh \?
the sound of these earbuds are great and they are a value for the price
using this kingston chip on my pearl 8100 phone and it has worked flawlessly
i work in a computer lab where we constantly re image devices \( using norton ghost \) i have 3 laptops and 1 dell gx620 desktop and all of them have gigabit connection when i connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous , i get the same performance \( 0 differences \) as i run 1 laptop to the gx620 this testing was done with cat5 cables that i pick randomly from my lab i ca n't wait to add more devices and using cat6 cables to get my work done faster
the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car however , the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs the 9 feet using the gps 's internal antenna when in an open area garmin 's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around \( on my gps \) i feel the antenna was worth purchasing
i use the suctions mount antenna because i remove from sight whenever i leave my car which is idea for my purposes the antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock the only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up
this unit has a v in my thought was that one could play video games on it , or view images from a camcorder digital camera however , all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen so it does not allow me to do all i wanted it is also a bit on the loud side if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit i got one of those also , and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor it also does not make much noise
this is a great swicth with low price i use it together with d link di 704 4 port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 pc , two servers , one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp connecting via the swicth for internet sharing does n't show any noticeable slow response as compared to connecting via the router directly it works well by itself as we as with d link di 704
i would highly recommend this phone set easy to program and crystal clear reception a definite 5 star
works well with canon 10d , 30d , and s40 fairly fast write speed and 4gb pretty big \( 1600 jpgs in the 30d ! \)
for the epson photo 1270 , the photo quality and color are excellent i have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer
this product was very easy to set up hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time been running 3 months with no problems what so ever would highly recommend
i am amazed by the quality of the guitar the product is extremely good the service by amazon was ultimate thanks a lot amazon
since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas , i recommend you get this one depending on type of your ipaq \( 1900 series vs 3000 series \) , you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case once you 're done , however , it 's very easy to use and carry it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket , unlike so many other cases the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface , this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection \( klutzes be warned \) the leather feels surprisingly good , almost a lambskin kind of quality the credit card space is not very useful , but you can shove a couple of business cards in there a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
this is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers you do n't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming ! excellent travel accessory
works exactly as advertised i travel a lot and i can finally enjoy those long travel hours in planes calmly
unit 's range shorter than expected , but i feel that i got what i wanted , and paid for shipping and delivery were great
i was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both ! ! it 's very easy to learn and enter stuff i'm a first time pda owner and this is an excellent product !

if you 're looking for isolation from ambient noise , these are great i use them as in ear monitors for my onstage use \( rock band \) , and if i use the foam inserts , i can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off
i found this on clearance at another retailer \( i guess not everyone likes pink \) , and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for skinny armed people , but not so ! i 've got plenty of room , it fits great , and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way , though makes mowing the lawn way more fun
the phone works great ! i have three of these and a base the best phones i have had the other phones i have are the tcx800 model \( previous version \) , equally good
i just use the keyboard like a business user i do n't use the media stuff i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works i like that it 's not huge and does n't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use the rechargeable mouse is handy as well prior to this , i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row , and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me i do n't know if it 's because it 's logitech or it 's bluetooth , but the keyboard mouse are as responsive as were they wired \( after they wake up \)
i used the tripp lite to charge my powerbook and digital camera during a cross country trip to grad school it worked great and i had no problems the only thing i could have used was a second outlet
esactly what i was wanting when you turn there is resistance \( springs i think \) and everything works great if you use flight sims you need this product works awsome
nicely designed leather case w belt clip i bought this for my hp hx2415 pockets good for sd memory cards belt clip hooks very tightly to belt , so you do n't have to worry about dropping pda
este estuche lo compr para mi ipaq hx2415 y es muy c modo de llevar porque no es grande y adem s el equipo se mantiene seguro por el dise o que tiene
this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need as a chronically disorganized person , the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings the strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic , so shocks are well absorbed
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
great sound quality great signal quality i can hear everyone well , and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well the main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger , with a couple walls in between , and i have no problems with signal
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you do n't have big hands it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely , even if you are left handed the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who do n't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward , backward , and switch between programs the button in the middle though \( the one that lets you switch programs \) is out of the way it takes just a bit more effort to use , meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button i actually hardly ever use that button i ca n't live without the forward backward buttons though i find myself man handling other mice thinking they too have those neat , little buttons the mouse has a really good response to movement as well i 've used it for gaming as well , though i admit i'm not a hardcore gamer i really recommend this mouse i ca n't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
pros
i love it you can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
this is an excellent product if you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you i am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day i have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places the garmin gps 18 plugs right into the usb port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments i 'll admit nroute took a little getting used to \( for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you 're not going to find it \) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie instead of spelling hoover street you just type hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations a great buy for only 100 bucks ! if you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of gps , dont spend 500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome gps sensor for only 100
obviously , there are far better printers on the market but if you 're looking for a quality 3 in one in the 100 to 150 range , this one seems to be at the top of the pack
since i 've seen musicians use jbl speakers for their concerts , that gave me a trust in their product with that , i became an owner to a desktop jbl pc cpeaker this product has been satisfactory and by far i have no complaints from it
note this is a review of the targus pa225u retractable phone ethernet cord \( plastic casing \) it 's the rectangular model , not the oval shaped one
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well
i just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup i had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck however , with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear it is so small and just excellent great work , logitech
i have the canon mp500 printer and canon rebel xt camera both capable of producing amazing results , but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers if you are looking to print out very impressive photos , then i would recommend getting the 8x10 photo plus glossy definitely nice enough to frame and with plus glossy , you 're definitely saving instead of paying to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my mp500 and printed using plus glossy , and the print is significantly better than the original
i tested my new canon i960 with a variety of papers like most printers , the output is much better when using the manufacture 's own paper \( as opposed to the cheaper generic paper \) , but there is no need to buy the most expensive pro paper as neither i nor my wife could discern any difference between the two there may be a benifit to the pro paper that cannot be seen \( lasts longer \? \) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your canon printer \( i think they look better than the ones i get from the photo lab \)
i 've had this for at least 8 months now we 've used it with xd , sd , memory stick pro , pro duo \( with the adapter \) and a few misc cards that friends' cameras may be using
this reciever is great ! it even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building i have played with many gps units and have yet to see a reciever do that this is a definte buy it is extremely accurate also i highly recomend it
the gps works in both my dell axim x5 and in my hp compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card i have used it with ms streets and trips and arcpad
i 've had my hp5510 for 4 weeks so far everything works to my expectations except when i press the scan button an error comes up on the led unable to scan documents from printer to pc no scan options you need to install or run hp software for
this printer was fine until i changed cartridges and a contact was dirty now it wo n't quit printing alignment pages all the time i have about a million now , and its cost me a fortune in ink every 3 or 4 print jobs and i get another one
ok this is the 2nd ipod mini transmitter i have purchased that has broken within a month all of a sudden it just stops working , for no apparent reason do n't waste your money it 's a piece of junk
i bought this so i could listen to my ipod in my car in the city the first couple of times , it worked great , but after that , something happened it just would n't work all i heard was static , no matter what frequency i tried this on i have yet to take a road trip with it , so maybe that will work better , but right now , i am not happy with the product maybe the fact that i live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it , but it used to work on some frequencies , and now it just does n't anymore i am very disappointed
this would be a great phone if it worked all the time i had to return the phone within 1 day because the handset was defective amazon was very helpful and prompt with a response however the handset would periodically quit working and required that the batteries be removed and reinserted to make it operational after 2 months the handset died completely at t will replace the handset under warranty , but it could take up to 3 weeks to get the replacement
i bought this to use in hotels this thing sucks i barely got it to work in my house too slow to set up based on the size of this thing , just bring a longer eithernet cord i am really disapointed
be aware , the belkin f8z063 blk tunebase fm for ipod nano is not compatible with the 2nd generation nano i am returning mine to amazon , and buy a compatible one from the apple store
i have several friends that have had similar items in the last few years that have worked nicely i'm sure this is a great product having said that this product is not and i repeat is not compatable with the new ipod nanos the new ipod nanos are slightly wider than the original and will not connect to this product i really hope amazon puts up a warning soon and i will do my best to try to get that done again this does not work with the 4gb and i assume the 8gb nano as well so do not buy it unless you have the older model nano
i live in the atlanta area and was never able to get a good sound quality coming from the belkin fm transmitter it seemed like i was listening to a fm station that was not coming in good
i had this in my computer for a month , with a satellite radio on the audio in and speakers on the line out it started crackling and the audio was distorted after a few weeks i took the sb out and went back to the motherboard onboard audio and it worked fine
i purchased the coby ca 739 wireless fm transmitter and was horrified by how each of its pre programmed frequencies were major denver area radio stations or had high amounts of static the transmitter was noisy and weak i sent it back and took a restocking fee hit plus i had to pay for the return postage
i originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale , but i did n't install it until the beginning of july for our cross country trip from oregon to wash dc during the trip , there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the pacific northwest i kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city once i got out of the nw , i had no problems picking up a signal unless i was in a long tunnel or deep valley
i bought this card more then a year ago overall i'm not impressed , and would n't buy it again first of all , in 30 of cases it crashes my tungsten e secondly , the games are not that much fun simcity is extremely limited and not enjoyable to play at all honestly , i have more fun playing games i 've downloaded for free final annoyance the card is slimmer then a regular sd so it slides off easily from the slots of the hardcase making it easy to lose
i was hoping to buy a small handheld vacuum for my office and computer hardware \( keyboads , air inlets , and what have you \) however , the datavac has so little power , even after a full charge , that it 's next to useless i ca n't recommend it
the charger is very convenient power related to ad dc is extremely useful high tech design and features sucking and blowing power does not measure up to the price it has an extremely disappointing performance it feels like a child toy rather than a useful tool for a personal computer or laptop will not recommend anyone to purchase this item due to the lack of performance
these headphones are terrible , the sound is not good , and they hiss not worth the money i have real cheap ones that sound alot better
broken after 3 uses extremely flimsy spend a few more buck and buy something more substantial
i am not using this microphone , the cord from the back of my computer barely reaches uncomfortable to lean so far forward
the matte photo paper that i received was really poor quality no matter what setting my printer was set to , the ink ran together and created a really low quality photo i do not recomend this item
when it works , it works very well but one day it suddenly died on me i had a comcast technician come and test my modem and after using some complicated equipments to test it , he concluded that the modem is dead after he gave me another modem , my network is up again very bad reliability motorola should be more responsible for their quality control !
this receiver does n't work in rural areas it does n't work as well as a cheap battery powered fm radio
a 10 cable does the same thing do not believe the hype monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it its digital , 1s and 0s either it reads it or it doesnt
have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you an arm and a leg \? these cables cost that , your first son , and bidding rights to your estate do n't get me wrong monster makes great cables let there be no confusion on this point but they 're just incredibly expensive , and this is made much worse with these cables
ok it functions well as a clock radio just fine reliable but that 's not too much to expect yes , it will charge your ipod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually \( though not gradual enough \) gets louder the adaptor for my nano fit fine and i did n't find the clock too bright \( it has 3 settings \) but the sound is really terrible it sounds like its coming from a transistor radio
may be i got a defective one
i had several problems with the ipod , mostly because of its horrible software itunes it messed up the firmware on the device several times , it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes
i just purchased the hp dvd740e from costco , and burned the cdr disc came with drive the lightscribe worked really well , it was the first experience , so i came here for reviews on dvdr , i was told that the verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the hp 's , so i purchased the verbatim 30pk , received today i was so excited , that i immediately burn two discs with the best setting , but both come out fuzzy and presented the out of focus dull feel , look terrible with no detail compared to the hp bonus disc is this a joke \? this is my first amazon review , ca n't help to vent my disappointment thanks for the super fast shipping anyway
i have purchased 10 of these drives , all at once what a mistake they are very flakey and will 'disappear' while copying data to them by usb you have to turn the drive off and back on for windows to find it again i do not have this problem with any other usb drive only lacie drives you cannot use one as a backup for this very reason , copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks
this drive suffers from repeated delayed write file errors ultimately it means you will lose all the data on it
as of right now , i am an apple student developer
i had a previous good experience with a jabra headset this one was recommended for my panasonic cordless phone by jabra however , the sound quality is terrible it lacks any kind of high frequency response , and so sounds very boomy and full of bass , making it almost impossible to use it also needs a foam cover , since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy i contacted jabra about this product , but received no response maybe it would work better with a different phone , but definitely not with my panasonic
i was using it as a backup device and it failed after about 12 months so i am ripping it apart and putting in a new ultraata disk in just hope the box is not frying the disk
consumer beware ! ! ! !
do not buy this item , it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase and i bought 2 of them , so statistically it 's not jsut me the first time the door broke , and without the door there 's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection the second time , the usb part broke off and got stuck in my computer and i could not put it back together all in all , not the best product out there try instead the belkin usb to ethernet adaptor
don't buy this product there , simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly , apple support told me sorry , tough luck i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong !
please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled befsr41 v4 intermittent drop of connection which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support , i 'd post a url but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon
i like the phone 's simplicity and ergonomics it 's fatal flaw is the lack of range my office is about 50ft away from the base , and i get unacceptable interference both plain old at t ge 900 handle this distance without any problems
i 've been 'trying' to use this phone for the past 8 months worked fine in the beginning , now i ca n't even answer my calls i hit the talk button , but the phone continues to ring spend a little more money but buy a better phone this phone is a total waste of money
no tricks , just treats and delivered on time as promised
i do n't know if i just got a bad pair of radios , but they did n't work at all if we were beyond shouting distance the radios did not receive any signal at all even at very close range there was too much static to understand anything i 'll post a review of the sx700s after we get a chance to try them out
from cellphone and also the pager era i began my love affair with motorola do n't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great ! do n't buy these ! they fall into the former category
i purchased a biopod in march of 2006 received brand new unit that included omnipass software version 2 09 this software version released in 2004
i bought 1 40 pack of these disks so that i could create a set of windows 95 setup disks they worked to install windows once and then they all started dying i went to run windows setup and got halfway through and got a cannot read from device error after that i ran scandisk on all of them and only 1 disk didnt have bad sectors a few of the disks had bad sectors in the system area rendering them unformattable i advise anybody who reads this to steer clear of these cute little disks unless you want to use them as christmas ornaments
be creative ! ! mostly what you 're paying for is the embroidered 'magellan' name i like the crown royal idea of pouch or you can sew or obtain a fleece and make a square with pockets and tuck everything in there , works fine since the reviews are bad , i will not get this just to hide my gps away in an eye catching steal me monogrammed bag
i bought a second traveldrive because the first one purchased worked just fine the second drive does not work on my system \( windows millenium \) calling the service line i found out that there are two versions and the second is not compatible with the first after trying all the recommended solutions , the tech support suggested i request a warranty replacement trade for the original version or simply get my money back requests for a resolution of the matter have fallen on deaf ears i would not waste any more money on products from this company
we purchased this printer to replace old brother hl 1440 for our small business printing needs at first everything was great after 4 months of use , still on first toner cartridge , the manual feed can no longer grab labels or envelopes there is now a huge gap and the envelopes can slide all the way inside with no resistance huge problem for us and i hope we can return this piece of junk
when realtime traffic monitoring came to my city , i immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife 's daily business driving \( 2 500 miles weekly , crisscrossing a 50 mile area through major traffic routes \) i quickly settled on an automotive gps with realtime traffic monitoring there are not yet many choices in this area , so the options boiled down to this unit and the garmin 2720 \( these use fm radio for the traffic info the xm radio units like the tomtom 700 and garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since i do n't want xm radio \)
worked fine for a couple of weeks and then just died the problem was that it was not recognized by xp or linux anymore
this flash drive does not work with windows 98se the back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for windows 98se at the maufacturer 's web site first i tried downloading the driver turns out the driver is a zip file so i had to download winzip so i could unzip the driver after downloading the driver and winzip the flash drive is still not recognized by my pc the faq at the manufacturer 's web site states if the device is not recognized the bios on my pc must be enabled but the faq does n't tell you how to enable the bios
it does n't matter what dvd writer i used , velocity worked ! not one disk became a coaster i loved the velocity dvd r until i order 2 more spindles i ordered it directly for the manufacture when i received it , the outside plastic covering was cracked , half the disks had the jitters and the other half was coasters it seems to me that they trick you into ordering one with a great offer including free shipping if you order any more , the person shipping it to you send you the rejects from quality assurance i will never again order this product again period !
well , so far so bad i burned the dvds on my panasonic dvd recorder they play in my newer dvd players , but i cannot make a copy of them with sonic dvd , nero , or one click dvd unacceptable ! i have used many types of dvds , never had this happen i guess i know why some dvds i have purchased are playable , but not copiable it is the media ! i will stick with maxell , or tdk
worked for 6 hours , then just stopped transmitting what a waste of cash do not buy this
i had a terrible time getting a station to come in even close to fm quality there was always a bunch of static and the stereo buzzed between songs because i had to keep the volume too high the high band of frequencies seemed to work best , but then it led to crackling speakers everytime i turned something electrical on in the car it also seemed to kill batteries at a surprising rate
this is a total waste of money and engineering plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable fm player wrapping it back up and sending it back
the transmission quality is very poor i was unable to find a single frequency free of static while operating the belkin tunecast ii in my car i found that driving over or under bridges , under traffic lights , under power lines , or near large trucks increases the static to a level where the music can not be heard at all the only way i could get audio clarity equal to that of a dirty and scratched record or a distant am station was to hold the transmitter to the face of my radio what a piece of poo ! can i give it zero stars \? and do n't even get me started on the excessive packaging that you 'll need to use a diamond tipped jack hammer to open
if you have a palm , read this before buying this device
i have had two of these units i would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ml 300 save yourself some money and get something else both of the units lasted only 14 months i did hardly any typing with them only multi page forms and applications the printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing contacted brother international usa and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months save yourself some money and buy a big chief table and a number 2 pencil
after reading some good and bad reviews i went ahead and bought them anyway they will not stay in my ears , i tried the three different sized ear buds but non will do the job , very irritating
bought these and used them once had to remove them when i found myself in dire need of some excedrin migraine what do you get for your 39 \? cheap , tinny , bass less sound that 's like being plugged into a busted walkman the buds themselves do n't remain stable in the ear , so forget about using them while engaging in motion involved activity \( such as jogging , walking , head bobbing , neck movement , etc \) these are by far the worst earbuds on the market how could apple stoop so low \? do n't be fooled ! do a google search for these and you 'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product you 've been warned
i 've had this camera replaced by linksys 4 times the first time , was due to the camera crashing on a weekly basis the second replacement worked fine until i upgraded my router and switched from wep to wpa after the switch the camera would not connect to the router , switching back to wep , of course worked linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue , and with the last support call confirmed that there is a known problem with wpa encryption and this camera
i have extensive experience with wireless system setup and operation my whole system is all linksys gear after four hours on this camera , i give up
this is my first amazon review of any type i was quite happy to finally get a wireless keyboard and mouse when this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy it looks like someone painted the keys in a garage i expected better now i have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment , and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken i am not hard on the equipment and do n't know how it happened
this router had 1 4th the range of my standard linksys g router which suddenly burned out after less then a year the speed \( when i could get a signal \) was 1 to 11 mbps , my old router held a steady 54mbps i did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house , but i could n't use it with this router the expander only works with the basic g router , so no way to even boost the signal on this new one support was a joke , could n't get any help or explaination as to why the expanded range was so much less range the the previous unexpanded range bought another older version , and everything 's great again do n't waste your money or time on this
despite the slick marketing effort \( i e with srx \) , this product falls short
i am a huge logitech fan and buy their products in the truck load , unfortunately , this webcam is a dog with fleas the picture is blurry , the lighting is abmismal in low light and you can just get better performance from a less expensive web cam i am still a logitech fan , but you can get better performance from quickzoom

paid 34 at best buy for a cable that doesn't even work
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead , the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
these earphones provide excellent sound for the money rich bass , sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces
this does not fit the ipaq hx2755 do not try ! there are plenty of other cases out there that will work i ended up with a 94 cent digital camera case from wal mart that works better than this thing
this product is terrible and i'm going to return mine or throw it away it constantly wanders to places i do n't want it to be or trails where i think it should be based on my usage of other mice at this point i consider it unusable i 've tried it on several surfaces to see if it was a tracking problem , but noticed no real change in behavior i think what 's happening is it keeps trying to go to sleep while i'm moving it , because the tracking is ok as long as i'm moving it very quickly , but when i'm trying to precision target something like an icon or a piece of text it starts jumping erratically i keep it about 6 inches from my laptop at all times , and the laptop is n't complaining about connection problems
this is a nice 4 line phone , but the digital answering system does not work we have 2 984 's and several other brand 4 line phones i could not find any way to make either 984 work as a four line answering system auto attendent is useless in our situation these phones are certainly not worth the money unfortunately there are n't many 4 line phones on the market and apparently no 4 line digital answering systems
the first speaker came broken , i first called the manufacture but they wanted me to ship it at my cost for repair , that was not acceptable i then called amazon and you took the item back promptly
i ca n't get good reception at any range from source intermittent when two rooms away from source have to move the speaker unit around to find an acceptable location does n't automatically retune when being turned back on not at all what i expected from this piece of equipment
i assumed all tape adapters were comparable this one worked fine for 1 week then it sporadically ejected itself from the tap deck a few days later it broke completely and is now jammed in my tape deck the tape deck on my car stereo is now broken as is the macally podtape i would buy another a different brand of adapter , but i no longer have a tape deck that works in my car my worst purchase on amazon to date
have this optical cable for about a year before it was broken according to the package , it has lifetime warranty sent back to the company and got a rejected mail saying , company out of business , return to sender the company address on the label is
i tried to use it in my dell x50 and it hardly worked , was too slow , too short range , you have to unplug and plug it bacl again and again
i purchased this armband to hold my nano during workouts the band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training looking for a replacement right now
i purchased the 2 yrs warranty for my samsung lcd tv but i never received any information on it
the plug on the external antenna does bot fit the jack on the magellan unit avoid this until magellan figures this out seems like they would use a standard plug jack pair for all products
got this antenna from my wife for my birthday to go with my roadmate 760 i just purchased the antenna we received was the at 65 antenna instead of the large round antenna in the picture it was a small rectangular antenna \( 1 inch x 1 1 2 inch \) with no indication that it was an actual magellan antenna , on the unit itself the package had a magellan cardboard insert but this was definitely not the antenna pictured
unfortunately , i too received a switched item \( at 65 \) in a sealed magellan box today jennifer in customer service assured me that they will refund the purchase and that they will investigate the stock they have she was very apologetic and helpful i will see what happens but am thankful that she was there to help
using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe the distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration , just as it would be between a bike and a car
subwoofer should not be called that it 's tiny , and distorts if the slightest bass is put through it not good for music , not good for gaming steer clear
this radio is poorly built when you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out you put them back in , carefully set it down , then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again now , i put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review
i will not be sending this item to my frail 85 year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of florida it is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment this is unacceptable design failure for something the red cross is touting as a household essential
i had to return two faulty dvd players one would freeze frame the picture and the audio would keep on playing the replacement dvd player kept saying wrong disc and was very very loud when it would actually play a disc i ended up having to search and find a different dvd player all together because they would n't replace the 2nd faulty product \( which was packaged inappropriately and possibly damaged in shipment \)
the cigarette lighter adapter \( with speaker \) is really bad quality , the original one worn out within 1 year , i purchased a new adapter and worn out within 6 month garmin need to do better
short cord cannot be replaced , so do n't bother with this phone unless you can sit right by it to chat
this seller computer brain is charging 20 18 to ship these ink cartridges i knew the price was too good to be true
i ordered the passport x50 from amazon to save the 18 shipping escort radar was charging i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller
i 've got an engineering degree in computer science i 've been supporting multi million dollar web applications for years it took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for there is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player
i ordered this unit with high expectations , lots of memory , expandable , multiple modes , from a well known company and an excellent price how could i go wrong \? easily enough , as it turns out
i had high expectations for this product , having bought some of sandisk 's other products the problem with the e280 is that sandisk does n't give users the control or the versatility over file management for example , using it in the \( mass storage \) msc usb mode , one is forced to create playlists in windows media player this works , but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped
do not buy this item it is terrible
believe the opinions of most of the people who have made the mistake like me of buying this thing it is pure junk ! it has to be one of the worst hoaxes ever put over on consumers it does not work , and you can forget getting any real help or service out of griffin technology
it 's better if you spend your money in something else it has a ridiculous transmitting power so bad that even radio transmitters from miles away interferes with this device 1 ft from the radio receiver the audio quality is so bad that totally destroys the pleasure of listening to your music in fact this device should be forbidden to be sold or should be tagged as phony advertise
this is about the worse thing i 've ever bought for an ipod accessory it does not work all i heard was static , and very little music if you do want to hear music , you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you 'll get is static i bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it i was hesitant to buy it , seeing almost every review has said it does n't work but i bought it anyway , do n't buy it ! every review i 've seen has negative feedback for this item , and i agree with everyone i figured since griffin made a new itrip , it would be better and work great however , it is the total opposite from that i do not recommend this product at all do n't waste your time or money
never received the item have to go thru the process of filing a claim with ups for lost not delivered item no way to complain to amazon com
i purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews i , like others , cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on i even tired using the tricks described in another review
i wo n't recommend to any body you have the same way of charging thru your computer i think is waste
put the card in my w2000 pc , followed instructions got to the part about loading the driver , the book says to go to the drivers win2000 driver on the cd included in the box guess what , it 's not on the disk included in the box since i use a connection that needs this stupid card to work , now i have to find another pc and down load the driver
hard to figure out and organize music battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often do n't recommend it very not happy
a year later and i wish i had the money for an ipod i have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and do n't even take my player with me anywhere anymore what 's the point of having an mp3 player you ca n't walk around with \? ridiculous
we bought three creative players my husband and i have the zen micro and my daughter the zen 20gb all three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year i did n't even use mine but maybe two hours per week good thing my daughter 's was within her one year period by a couple of days she still had to pay 25 00 now my husband and i have to just junk ours and buy something else customer service is awful ! ! they wo n't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times what a piece of garbage ! !
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead , the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
i have a 5gb but a lot of the h10 's are having the same problem i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and ca n't be reinstalled i 've done a little research about the disappearing mp3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the h10 's and 1 other model i ca n't remember right now and iriver ca n't figure it out although i 've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug so buy with caution
i 've had this mp3 player since it came out and , if anyone is still considering getting it , i must advise otherwise the mp3 player itself looks and feels great , and the navigational features are very easy to use the problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable i have used 3 versions of this player \( expecting each time that the player was simply faulty \) , and all of them glitch up terribly i constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play it also freezes half of the time that i try to sync with wmp in addition , sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my h10 's list of tracks \( even though they no longer exist on the player \)
does not live up to expectations sound is tinny hard to find stations , very narrow band of reception plan to purchase a grundig
i ordered this mount for a sharp 20 inch lcd and it 's not that great it was very easy to install , however , the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level thus when the tv is pulled away from the wall , the set is not level and very annoying to look at i do n't believe this is a fault in the actual part , but the design of the arm this was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount and you get what you pay for
i 'd recommend selecting a different security cable product , especially if you have a powerbook or macbook this one is poorly made , even more poorly documented , and may have permanently damaged my powerbook g4 \( yes , the product web site claims this model is compatible with the pb g4 \)
total garbage no only this thing is huge , bigger than most mp3 players and it does n't have a belt clip or anything , it sounds awful , absolutely horrible the hiss others complained about is very loud , it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping , buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible , low dynamics and distorts easily this is a bad product that should be taken off the market it 's not even worth the price here heck , even 1 99 would be a waste of money avoid
it is a great idea , with a few qualifiers
it was great at first until the connector to ipod break by itself the bluetooth signal was n't the best , it loses signal constantly i had to re sync and paired it up several times over a month period the high price imuffs mb210 from wi gear gives a better promise with the ability to stop your ipod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone its bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on ipods with dock connectors , likely will not break as easily i sure hope logiteh will follow suit in this trend
the sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector all around poor quality and construction i'm thinking about returning it
it 's logitech it should have a built in microphone instead there 's a small head set do n't buy this spend a little more for a built in microphone
i have had this tv for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out , i called samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty they said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours 72 hours later still no call , i again called samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and i would be called in 24 hours , still no call this was repeated 5 times and each time i asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area
this is the third palm pda i have owned i bought the e2 directly from palm after my previous palm died it simply quit shortly after the warranty expired telephone support is poor and expensive after research this is a common problem
i am somewhat computer savvy i understand the the ip address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address they do n't match and i ca n't figure out how to change it i called netgear 4 days ago for help and they said their senior tech would have to call me back still waiting for that call back to staples it goes the installation appeared successful , but whenever i try to print , it says error printer is busy the so called instruction manual for this is laughable if you 're not an advance level it person , do n't try it
i bought this print server back in december 2005 i used it with my all in one brother printer mfc 4800 the installation was easy it worked great for 4 months then then it just stoped working after 4 months i tried to disconnect and reconnect the power , ethernet cable etc nothing helped
i had the same problems as already stated i am currently having the volume issue as well , and yes my batteries are weak \( the light is on \)
i waited 10 days for this to arrive the first time i plugged it in it ran for 2 minutes i typed dear and the machine typed wcm when i tried to erase wcm the erase mechanism did not work i turned the machine off and when i switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move , ie i cannot type or use the machine in any way when the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and i had to stick them back on now when i look at the machine i can see it is assymetrical there is a 1 4 gap in the base , so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere this is not acceptable but i have no way to contact whoever mstasad is i have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but i do n't have a typewriter that works i feel cheated and am very upset
i got 0 1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help but it did n't get any better you 'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you , i suppose
i bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging it was not true to what was said these batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera and a set of duracell ultras , that are not rechargeable , lasted longer do not always believe what you read make sure you have the ability to return items and is with this case , they went back i went with a set of energizers and they last much longer , with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand
i purchased the zen nano four months ago it was working then total system failure at first i thought the battery was dead , but a new battery did n't help the screen would flash on and then off it will not boot up plugging it into the computer did no good , it could not be reconized or accessed it goes in the trash in addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored also , the output volumn was to low i would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise , it was n't up to the task now it is landfill
i had to buy a new one , and i chose another brand \( logitech \) this time
do not buy this may be the worst product i 've ever bought it has never worked properly i 've kept fresh batteries in it , but it 's still no good within 10 feet of the laptop , i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then , i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen
do not buy this mouse !
i bought one of these it worked ok about three months and then just quit i do not recommend for anyone else
i tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and i could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs , but most of the time it failed i tried to record with an ipod no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives
got it home and it had poor focus the center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus the next morning the focus problem was gone go figure the big problem for me was the time it took to change channels a full 3 seconds went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs well i took it back and went to walmart and got a sanyo ht27546 for 270 good set with quick channel change it also has an optical digital outputwhich the toshiba did not the sanyo also has a full one year warrenty sound on both tvs is fine a small point the toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit mute
i posted a review two weeks ago , but it has n't appeared , so i'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove \( note despite what some other reviewers seem to think , it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock \) recently , the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook , despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support , i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently , the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook , i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus
mine did n't work out of the box just my experience i am taking this thing back to the store tomorrow i returned another crappy webcam today to buy this , so you can imagine how irritated i am with the lame quality of these things
as far as using the ipod as a recorder i think an actual digital recorder would get better sound the italk picks up all ambient sound i have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity
it 's partly my fault , of course i bought this to use on my motorcycle i thought the small size , especially the flat body , would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag i also bought a special handlebar mount for it unfortunately , i 've had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes whether you 're driving a car or a motorcycle , it 's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route maybe it was intended for pedestrians only the user interface for the gps is not intuitive \( at least , not for me \) , worse still , it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes the garmin helpline in the uk could only tell me to reset the machine each time not very helpful my guess is that the combination of palm pc and gps was too much for garmin to handle they should probably just stick to gps
i use it for my zen microphoto and it does not work at all it has the lowest battery life , used it for twenty mintues and it started to get worse and worse there is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the mp3 player below the transmitter , which is obviously dangerous while driving you can only tune it to four stations which are 88 1 , 88 3 , 88 5 and 88 7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an fm transmitter i seriously regret every buying this transmitter
it 'll do in a pinch but i hope there are better options
i 've spent over two hours tweaking this , and over an hour on the phone with customer support the thing still wont connect to the internet do n't get me wrong , the lights light up and my laptop can connect to the router , but the router wont connect to the internet
thinks my street is 50 feet before it actually is , therefore recalculates before the turn
this thing works well until a bulb blows out when i replace the bulb , it will not turn off after 4 minutes and i end up having to replace it
i knew i had to pay shipping for this cards \( 5 \) so i decided to buy 4 at once , what was my surprise that at checkout they wanted to charge me five dollars shipping for each card eventhough they were going to be ship together i decided not to buy them anymore they lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1 but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35 more than anywhere else its a shame that they try to rip you off that way buy them at the apple store on line , no shipping fee ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you pay only face value not a cent mor
why does a 15 00 gift card cost 24 00 \? i was going to get one but first someone explain this to me \? is the card itself made out of gold \? whaz up wit dat
i loved my little seagate 5 0gb drive , even after the first one crashed and burned but the second time , i cannot forgive i carried it everywhere in my pocket , and maybe that was part of the problem , but if it ca n't handle that then it is no good to me solid state memory , here i come
i dislike ipods so i figure i try something else and hope for the best unfortunately i was wrong
the mouse worked well with my chipset , but beaware that earlier bluetooth chipsets do not have the power to work with this mouse , although the dongle that is bundled with this is excellent
i bought this phone for a work at home situation i then discovered that the maximum number of characters i could enter into a speed dial entry \( the number itself , not the name \) is 24 characters a telephone calling card number is 25 characters long , 26 if you program a pause \( a space , for this phone \) between the phone number and the card id pin when i called polycom about it , i was told that not everyone uses calling cards funny i 've been issued a calling card at every company for which i 've worked \( going back 25 years \) this is the only phone i 've ever owned \( well , since the 80 's \) into which i could not program my calling cards pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss
this thing sucks i wasted my money no more griffin products for me
the transmitter does n't work i tried everything i could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt
this item said that it is compatible with all ipods but it is not it is only compatible with the old ipods evidently there is a difference in some of the more recent ipods and this itrip does n't work with them we had to return the product
i just got these at a local store and they just really blow ! ! ! i was swayed by the brand name and the great price \( although higher than amazon \) it 's true when they say you get what you pay for rock bottom price rock bottom performance terrible to say the least mine are going back right now
mine worked great for the first few months , then i started getting the warning , check battery if you take the batteries out and reinsert , it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up it happened on both headsets i called customer service and they told me this is the first time they 've ever heard that \( uh huh does n't sound like it from the reviews here \) a little too expensive to replace yearly
i 've had this mouse for about a month use it with my mac g4 at home and i'm exhausted it feels very nice in the hand and i really like the scrolling ball feature \( hence the 2 stars \) , but it 's just not predictable sometimes it glides along smoothly , most other times it tracks across the monitor like you 're mousing over pebbles i 've tried a number of different surfaces desktop \( light woodgrain \) smooth , medium gray fabric mouse pad mouse pad made specifically for optical mice \( better than the other two \) and i have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission to no avail it still lags and i have a hard time honing in on an object to select it \( or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle \)
for my powerbook my first bluetooth mouse \( a macally bt \) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk so for the replacement i read the reviews and went with the kensington bluetooth mini primarily for the on off functionality
one of the reasons i chose this mouse , was because apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling it turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others it jerks one line at a time the clicking is quite loud i might add also , i have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if i do n't sometimes just clicking on system preferences corrects the problem , but if i had it to do over , i 'd buy something else
i bought this in april for my new canon 30d and it worked great until several months ago when i would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying data corrupted it started out slowly then it would lose every third picture i tried to reformat the card and got an error message now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer it was a wonderful card while it lasted but i too am hesitate to get another one hopefully mine was a lemon too but then again
this seemed like a great card at a great price unfortunately after 4 months , during the middle of a paid shoot , all of the images instantly dissappeared i stopped using the card , put it aside until i got home i tried to use software to recover the images only a few could be recovered , the rest were gone i 've not been able to re format the card in either a canon eos 5d , digital rebel , or using software on my computer the card is now completely un usable
i purchased 3 of these aps with the expectation to replace 3 cisco b aps and drop in the setup used radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs after config \( the web ui constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re login \) the system would work one quark was the ip address field for the radius server would n't accept more than one character in the forms up and running however , upon reboot , the wg302 loses it radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again showstopper after logging this with netgear support their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support while this would be fine if it was a config issue , it 's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase they give no further support now
first a disclaimer i know very little about telephone headsets , but decided to buy one because i had a series of long telephone meetings coming up
since i first wrote this review i discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer after formatting my computer i was able to install the scanner and software without any problems i am still learning to use it but so far i have decided not to return it it works well and i like it very much i apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone 's choice
i have approximately 10 , 000 slides to scan i purchased the 4850 and after about 3 , 000 slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image after reporting it to hp they sent me a replacement tma the new tma worked fine for the first 450 slides and then bingo , i now am getting two dark blue lines again i think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load i have
my daughter really did n't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart the wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it a low price for a guitar but i do n't think it 's even worth this price
these phones had so much static , you could not hear ! ! ! we ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use !
i bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2 line phone with answering capability turns out , i cannot keep it , due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me
my very first cell phone was motorola , and it served me great , so i became attached to the brand based on that experience , and for that reason alone bought motorola sd4591 digital corded cordless system as we 've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks the battery life got very short very soon too i was told i need to get different batteries nih instead of nicd naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too as we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5 8hz 2 line phone i decided to get motorola md7091 5 8ghz digital 2 line phone and remained loyal to motorola and boy was i wrong again what others are saying about caller id not showing as soon as i have another phone on the same line besides motorola md 7091 is true in my case too i do n't get it does motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones \? \? \? this is really cheap trick
now , imagine my astonishment after receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers , i set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base !
i had high hopes for this case when i bought it , but it just has n't worked out the leather has a nice feel , and my ipaq fit snugly in it 's slot however the stylus on my ipaq h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the ipaq from it 's case this became so frustrating that i eventually discontinued using this case
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall i thought the first one was a defect , but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it what i do n't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it satisfaction guaranteed what a joke
ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no \? if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4 also the video you convert may have a few complications , the audio and video may not be sychronized at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download com and search for jodix video converter this is not from speculations i have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted suggestion check out the creative zen vision m sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it
i bought with lots of ilussion this this ipod , i put all my music in it and use it ! ! after a 5 months it stop working , it did n't charge the battery i took it to best buy where i bought it and they told me that it has external damage and didn' repair it i send it to apple service and return it without services because the same reason my ipod did n't have that damage , it has only a few scratches on the screen after lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it i would have to pay us 250 00 that is almost what it cost new terrible service from apple short live don't recommended now i'm looking for another option for mp3 player to buy
like other fm transmitters i have tried , this one leaves much to be desired living in a major urban area , i was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality product is easy to use , but i consider the sound quality unacceptable
the phone worked for a month or two , and then the handset stopped seeing the base when i followed the instructions in the manual to fix this \( re register the handset to the base \) , neither could see each other
i'm pissed i feel i 've been ripped off the 3rd party vendor delivered a defective unit i want to return it i have been unable to determine how to return this unit for a refund i may never buy through amazon again
this product did not reliabley work in a new sony psp running the current sony software do n't know if the design is flawed or the unit i received was defective
got it and plugged it into my ipod and there was a major incompatibility the screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the ipod but when i went to record i received an error message that the ipod could not locate a microphone perhaps an ipod problem \? the ipod is a 4th generation 40 gig that is fully updated i think belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new ipods , with the exception of the minis have not been able to resolve the issue i am sure ipod will state that it is a belkin problem and that belkin will throw the ball back to ipod \? \? \? \?
i just received my pair today , and i have to say , i'm extremely dissapointed yes , they are comfortable , but the bass is almost absent , no matter how far you jam them into your ears , the bass is n't nearly what it were hyped to be , it definently is n't enough for the amount of mid hi 's they produce unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max , i 'd recommend another pair of earphones if you 're just looking for comfort and you do n't like hardly any bass , these are your headphones but , as others said , you can find much better earphones for a much lower price
the first thing i did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually was an apple product its really cheap looking looks like something you 'd find for at a flea market or in the stocking stuffers section of the dollar store at christmas time the nano is small so almost anything will hold it , including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit
3 more of the useless flimsy holders you get in the ipod box !
i had a very poor experience with the microsoft media center infrared keyboard and i wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would i thought get rid of all connection problems
this hardware is well made and i have heard very good things about the non bluetooth version of the mouse when it 's connected and working , it does its job very well unfortuntately the mx5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively at seemingly random intervals , the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether if this happens during gameplay , you 're in a bad way the keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug when it comes off of its sleep state , it will double the first key you press i have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue add in that the setpoint software for the lcd screen only fully works with two pieces of software \( musicmatch and windows messenger \) , and you have a very disappointing desktop package the mx1000 is a great mouse on its own , but stay away from this bluetooth combo it is unstable and very frustrating to use
the unit works fine as a bluetooth radio
does not work at all dont throw away your money should read 0 star
i had vonage since april , 2006 i finally switched back to qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone \( my cell phone , as my vonage line did n't work \) with tech support here is my experience
i bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal , and provide features that traditional phone companies do not good thing i kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with vonage
stay away from vonage ! after more than 1 month , still do n't have phone number transferred ca n't get thru to customer service very long wait paying 2 phone bills so much for saving cost and so called service called to cancel service , and customer service rep promised to put account billing on hold until phone number transfer is done finally something positive from customer service department
very disappointing speakers !
i too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose i bought another thinking i had a faulty one , but now i'm having the same issue with this one the loose jack causes the reception to go in and out and finally just out completely i agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw
1 there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base
i bought this and found that if you like to burn your own cd 's to play in it , it has a problem reading the tracks it sometimes spins up and does n't play , and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find i usually wake to that sound before the music starts i am not a light sleeper this is my second one , and i 've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months do yourself a favor and find a different product
this product does not have the skip feature included in the product descriptio
your buying 128 mb worth of frustration and 10 worth of gas from back and forth to wal mart
the keyboard and mouse work fine , except for some completely absurd reason , logitech decided to remove the insert and escape keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead look at the picture and you will see what i mean the delete key is double size and takes up the space where the insert key would be insert is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button escape is in the usual place , but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key very annoying definately returning it
ordered it , took about 5 days to get to me , and it 's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it
i was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes
the jbl speakers worked fine for 3 weeks and all of a sudden , they quit in the future , i will buy this type of merchandise locally so that i have some recourse
i was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews , however , i have been extremely disappointed in them i may have had too high of expectations , but these things put out no bass whatsoever \( it just sounds muffled and cruddy \) , and the overall sound is extremely poor i'm really surprised as i 've owned jbl speakers in my car that i was extremely pleased with , so i'm amazed at the lacking quality in these i would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included
these speakers sound great but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that 's a no no so you reach for your phones and no place to plug them in ! how lame is that \? also whoever designed the volume on off knob is an idiot the thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it , the whole speaker just slips away from you they 're so light that they do n't have enough resistance to stay put so you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other \( unless you velcro them to your desk or something \) too bad because like i said they sound great
agree with the prior reviewers i can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses !
i have bought several of these some came in a fancy blister , and others in a coushing bag stay away from those be sure you 're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different
i bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with sd memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card \( xd and memory stick \)
its a traditional serveware for serving the soup course the color of the tureen set allows it to be used with many of the dinnerwares the size is adequate to serve at least 8 10 people the under plate is something not found with usual tureen sets which gives it an elegant look but it appears a little overpriced
i used metal muffin pans before , the muffins will never come out without the help of a knife , even the pan was sprayed
i 've had my keurig for about two months now and absolutely love it it makes wonderful tasting coffee in 30 seconds or so it was well worth the extra money
i ordered these just to make my 25 i'm sure they are well worth the price i paid , would be ideal for a one two person family i will use them for gifts
this is the best blender i have ever used it grinds indian style batter real good it grabs and churns the mixture quickly i am using it for the past 5 months , and there has been no problems with it the jar is plastic and easy to handle and clean
this is the best steam cleaner it really gets your carpets looking like new again and i was very surprised that it worked great on old stains as well i love the attachments for the furniture as a pet owner the attachments and the cleaner work wonders i especially like the turbo surge button this works for the high traffic areas and i have 2 dogs that like to roll around the carpet to itch there backs and these spots get dirter , so this feature works great for cleaning the deep down areas , makes my carpet 's look new again ! this is also easy to use to fill the water and empty it too , i am very mechianically not smart but this is soooo easy to figure and and use it is a breeze ! i love my cleaner
how many men do you know who rave about irons \? let me tell you this iron is a great buy ironing has become a breeze with this product instead of a dreadful hassle i iron my shirts every day before work and it shows ironing was never been my favorite pastitme but now i actually set up time in my day just to use this product ! this iron makes every shirt look like i just picked it up from the dry cleaners with its easy to use steam function you ca n't beat the price too
they are very big , the spoons are very uncomfortable to use , they should have been smaller and a better grip
i have several of these pieces in various sizes and colors i cook and serve in them all and they clean up beautifully i highly recommend them
i splurged and bought this product for my espressos in the morning i bought the pint sized model for 35 00 \( you use one charger each time you open the container up so if you get the half pint size you will need to stock up on chargers \)
i got one of these as a x mas gift a few years ago and love it ! it is especially wonderful around the holidays i like to make pies and it is great topping on all types of pies we also drink a lot of flavored coffee and hot chocolate in the winter \( its pretty cold here at night \) and love to top it off with the cream i'm not sure about the flavored syrups , but i just add some flavored coffee creamer \( international delight or coffee mate \) to the container and it makes it taste so good it is such a hit at holiday parties that i have to borrow my mom 's to keep up with the demand it makes a great gift just be sure to get enough off the cartriage containers or you will run out
i love this rice cooker ! it replaced one i had for many years , and was sure i would never find another i liked as well i was wrong this rice cooker is absolutely the best it has replaced the broken one hands down the rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd , it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store i would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often
i had a zojirushi nhs 10 and worked fine i gave it to my sister in law grin
this is a great saucepan ! ! ! lightweight , easy to clean , we love the straining lid ! we got the red one totally worth buying ! thanx
i have the tucker burn guard commercial line , kitchenaid and various designer potholders and i 've stopped using them all except these oxo these are great for blocking the heat i have smallish female hands and i admit that these mits took some getting used to once i got used to them \( after the first or second use \) i routinely reach for them its to the point that i do n't even have the other ones out anymore i am here looking to replace my original set of 3 \( 2 mits 1 potholder \) and i was surprised by the negative reviews so surprised in fact that i am writing this review i swear by them
i must agree with everything that has been written previously this fan is sturdy , attractive , quiet and well built with all the features one would want or need on a table top fan and you ca n't beat the price
i did a lot of research before purchasing a grinder and i'm glad i took the time to narrow it down to this one it has done a great job at a consistant grind , with minimal noise , and tons of grind settings quality
this is a durable sprayer , not a mister i went through 3 or 4 misters before finding the hoffritz sprayers mine are 3 years old and going strong the misters , including the expensive stainless steel one , simply do not last very long we use a lot of olive oil and these sprayers have held up well they do require a good push and you get more olive oil than you would with a mister
i do n't know how anyone could think that the outlast material is n't working \( of course it has been significantly tested and proven that it works \) at first its cool after about 5 minutes \( depending on the person \) outlast starts keeping an even temp
consumer reports rated this a best pick toaster for the money , and we agree 100 it toasts beautifully just what it 's supposed to do , right
i got this rice cooker about 8 months ago , and i have probably used it once a week since then it most certainly makes better rice than i could before \( cooking in a pot on the stove \) , but the results are often inconsistent
i was suprized when i read the 1 review i have had mine for 3 years and had no problems , it has been in the dishwasher , put away by my two kids no cracks no chips , cleans up great
i had heard that the shape of riedel wine glasses enabled one to maximize the nose of a wine how very true ! i was amazed how much more of the wine 's bouquet was immediately noticeable with these glasses and , they feel great in your hands i highly recommend them for wine enthusiasts
i love the rapid ice wine coolers i give them for token gifts and use them frequently myself they are great for a spure of the moment glass of wine that needs chilling
great for frying eggs , but i prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets every grilled sandwich i 've made on this griddle has come out perfect my kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it i 've found that pre heating the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top the pre seasoning works great
man what a great pancake and a grilled chesse skillet it 's the perfect size for pacakes i 'd give it 10 stars if i could love it
this pan is perfect not too big , nor too small for a perfect soup for the price , you ca n't get better this pan replaces my farberware 6 quart , and overall , it is n't any bigger just holds 2 quarts more love it
found this item on the net when it was
i received the shipment very quickly despite not paying for the shipping i love the skillets they 're very heavy duty and are a great addition to my circulon cookware
it 's a very good cooker
this is great i use it to grind flax seed it works well and is fairly easy to clean the cord winds up into itself , which is very nice , to keep it out of the way when storing it
this pot is a great deal i had it for a couple of weeks now and it has been great for cooking , nothing sticks to it and clean up is easy i love the glass top for see what is in the pot and how it is cooking great pot for the money i find this pot to be just as good as my non stick calphalon if not a little better and the price is lower then the calphalon
it 's excellent if you already have a good foodsaver they are thick and good quality bags it works really well and does keep food fresh only good for small and dry foods though , but they are reuseble to a certain point
i received this set as a wedding present and have loved using it over the past 4 months i cook several times a week , mostly for husband and myself , and sometimes for guests this set has been perfect for my needs , and has performed very well i follow the care directions \( handwashing , no metal utensils \) and the non stick coating has done very well i love the glass lids and the cushy handles
the feature 's on this machine are what drew me to choose krups espresso maker the pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw the water tank and its size , not having to fill it every day the fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it and nobody makes a frothier frother than krups makes i love the lattes and i use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher you can make two cups at once i use it daily and sometimes more than once a day ! it makes a great espresso with beautiful crema i have not had any problems with this machine clean after every use i ca n't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area and do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups follow cleaning instructions !
my husband , \( a jaguar lover \) , calls this the e type of toasters ! it is beautifully designed requires minimal space and is 'simply' sophisticated to achieve the perfect toast using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times , turning it twice , now it 's one single click
i love to have a dinner party with a cake in this case it 's elegant and gets compliments from all i have found it to be sturdy enough , as mine came in one piece and is not broken or cracked this is a very nice case cake looks even more tempting
this is a wonderful appliance and at what a savings ! mine arrived promptly and in shipped from the manufacturer condition this is such an improvement over my old waffle maker \( no matter how much i greased it the waffles always stuck \)
this unit does everything it is designed to do have used it several times now and the only question we have is , when do we change the oil \? we think it 's kinda like your car , if it looks and smells bad dump it grin !
at 20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget realistly the retail value is not 80 it is around 40 the fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great if the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money do n't complain about it when it 's plainly listed an easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer the only reason i deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy it feels like it would tear very easily this is not a problem for me as i find them annoying but may bother some people all in all i think it is a great deal
the glass cover fits well the heavy bottom distributes heat well the ease of cleaning is wonderful it 's a great addition to our kitchen
i just received this as a wedding gift and it is beautiful ! a great gift
i love this product , the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it does n't take up much space it chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff , the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out the other bad thing is the plastic , everytime i use the processor the smell of what i'm making last in the plastic bowl and wo n't go away until i make something else and i did clean it very hard overall i do recommend this product to all
i had the same wok for four of the five years that i lived in china it was made of the same type of carbon steel as this one when i came back to the usa last year , i looked all around for this kind of wok and was very happy to find it
the kitchen aid hand mixer is actually more than i expected it is light weight , easy to use , and has attachments that other mixers do n't usually have while it is more expensive than your average hand mixer , i definitely feel i got my money 's worth i have other kitchen aid products and they last forever i have never been disappointed in their performance
i purchased this product because i have recently starting baking cookies and stirring cookie dough by hand left my arm and shoulder sore i know kitchenmaid as a quality product name instead of the large mixer i opted for this handheld model because i do n't have alot of counter top or space
great invention ! i drink mostly loose teas , gave up coffee some time ago because of work and being mom , i spend a lot of time in my car i have tried several travel presses and most of them do n't trap all of the leaves under the press , especially leaves that unroll as they steep this is the most practical travel mug that i 've ever seen and the storage compartment is absolutely great for carrying extra loose tea for those all day meetings i ordered one for my desk and one for those long car trips
i was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable i thought a french press would be a great idea , but all of them seemed to be made of glass and i did n't want to leave my press laying around where i work \( we share space with other companies so people come and go \) with this mug all i have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea \( and maybe some sugar \) wait a bit , push down the press and drink the whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber the bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh
the effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today ! cast iron is always a good value for the money and it 's indestructable \( i'm still using my mother 's lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954 \) this dutch oven , designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook , goes from the fire to the table with ease it stews and bakes beautifully get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis ! also makes a fabulous wedding , shower , or housewarming gift forget expensive wedding registries buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet she 'll hand them down to the next generation every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller highly recommend !
i have used a brita filter water pitcher for many years , and i love it ! the directions clearly state not to use hot water , and the filter snaps into place in order for the water to filter through properly when my daughter visits , she says , i 'd like a glass of brita water ! quot
i struggled through many pages of product reviews and descriptions before i finally decided to purchase this particular brand why \? because i did n't have a clue on which brand was good or bad , many of the reviews for mushroom egg slicers were mixed , so i took a stab in the dark , and came up a winner ! ! this is a great product , stores easily , and works well the curve where you put the mushroom \( or egg \) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver ! i love it
honestly i do not , for the likes of me , understand why anyone would give this cookware a bad review it appears that those who have , either ca n't read or did n't bother
love these measuring cups easy to use and see measurements no more bending or guessing worth the money
well constructed , good lid fit and solid handles the cover handle gets very hot in use but this is to be expected as it is metal the saucepan handle is quite narrow and if wet , or greasy , could be annoying to handle when draining the pan \( although i have not had this problem with any of the pans in this range \) all in all , i think this is excellent valu
i have owned this skillet for 25 years and it 's still going strong , even with constant use still looks great , too it 's a good size , easy to clean and useful for many purposes the aluminum core spreads the heat well this is a great value for the price
this is a great device and has multiple settings to keep tasks on track very full featured and easy to use
i have bought this timer numerous times , and , after a few years , after it falls into a pot of soup or something , i go buy another reasons a \) the programmable timer which allows you to time several dishes simultaneously b \) sturdiness its magnet does not stay glued to the back forever , but otherwise it 's durable for an everyday electronic gadget you should get several years of use out of it c \) it 's one of the only timers i can find and i look at big box stores , major discount stores , the supermarket , etc that allow you to time dishes longer than an hour or 99 minutes this is important for pot roast , big chickens , turkeys , unusual dishes that simmer overnight , and so on
in my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there !
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products le creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once for this reason , one pot may look like another , but each is unique in its own way
i 've owned this board for a year now pros light weight , you can use very sharp knives on and not get much indentation on the board , compact cons well it can be a con that it is light weight since if you are trying to cut a larger item it might shift , but honestly , if you just get a cutting board that is larger you 'd have the perfect cutting board
i am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 simply because i do not like the way this just pulls on and off i 've never purchased a shaker before though , but i would appreciate one the screws off and on so the top is certain to be on every time ! other than that it 's very sleek and the strainer in the top is a plus
i have used this jigger several times a week since i got it back in november , and i think it 's great i often make a second round with it it is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on , but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks
this fry cutter is good if you have a small potato and want some fries otherwise you will need to cut your potato first also , it takes a bit of effort to use
this was a simple and easy to use product i did n't even have to read the directions on how to remove the blades the only downfall is that you ca n't use very big vegetables i use it to make home made french fries i had to cut the potato in order for it to fit in the cutter aside from that it 's a great product
i had a panasonic teflon coated iron before this i did n't have any idea how much easier ironing could be teflon is way overrated ! do n't get me wrong , i still hate ironing , but at least now its over a lot faster plus , the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever i'm ironing , and its easy to fill with water the only thing i 'd like is a retractable cord , but it is n't a real cause for complaint
after reading a recommendation from consumer reports i was excited to see this iron for less that the suggested price in two days it arrived and i am very pleased with this iron although it is a bit heavier than my old one , the results were great no tax \? no shipping \? no parking the best way to shop
loved this grill , unfortunately we have only limited counter space otherwise i will put this grill permanently in the counter my husband loves the burgers that i made from this grill they lean and delicious ! ! !
i really enjoy cooking with the combo grill griddle , its saves a lot of time on breakfast , lunches and dinners you get more meals at one tim
if you are looking for a nice , inexpensive set of knives , look no further this set is very sharp , cuts well and fits into your hand nicely they have great balance and apperance the box is a little cheap feeling and looking , but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet
i bought my vacu vin set about 4 years ago and it 's still working perfectly it 's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days we no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine i 've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they ca n't live without it now
product works as described , keeping red and white wines for longer than their normal corked shelf life case could be a bit more substantial with a higher cosmetic appeal
i have to say , i have been needing a meat pounder for a long time and this one is great i used it on chicken and it did a great job with very little effort on my part plus is was very easy to clean , just some soap and water i am very pleased with this item
i just moved into my new place and i wanted a new set of dishes that were simple but unique and this set was perfect just like past reviews have stated , these pieces are a perfect size the bowls are awesome cereal bowls , the dinner plates are large , the salad plates are perfect for salad or a sandwich w chips and the coffee cups are used every morning for my cup of joe i bought a second set to make sure i had plenty for when friends came over for dinner speaking of friends over for dinner , on the two occasions that i have had friends over for dinner since i bought the set , people always compliment the pieces i am very happy with my purchase
i cant say enough about this set the cups are the perfect hot beverage size the dinner plates are big enough for any meal and i love the square shape they are versitle and fit any style they also fit perfectly in the dishwasher and they set straight up and do not fall over so i never need to re wash the salad plates are big enough for salads , desserts , appetizers or condiments bowls are great too
makes the best long grain brown rice that i 've ever tasted only wish that zojirushi made a 5 cup version of the induction rice cooker
i love this little fan it 's perfect for cooling one person i have it on my nite table and use it every night amazingly quiet and soothing air
after reading the reviews , i decided to try these , since i was n't too thrilled with either the cost or quality of the senseo pods after getting my three sets in the mail , i went to my grocery store , bought the starbucks sumatra whole beans , ground them to expresso grind , and went to try the ecopads i followed the instructions , put the ecopad in the machine \( perfect fit \) , hit the 8oz button , and wa la ! i would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the stuff you pay 3 50 a cup for at starbucks i'm definately hooked i ca n't see how other reviewers have had problems with these they are easy to fill , and fit perfectly in the machine they are a bit messy to clean up , but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks i would estimate i will get 50 60 cups out of a 6 store bought bag of coffee basically , one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly also i would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad they seem very durable i am looking forward to trying different coffee 's with these well worth the tiny investment
i love to cook , and own several different brands of cookware , all clad , cuisinart , and calaphone this sauce pan did n't disappoint me i love it ! ! the pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1 2 quart pans this is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce , or if you need a little extra room to stir something i am very , very happy with this
bought this set at a reasonable price of 19 99 and have liked them so much that i will be buying some more ! great set for the price , ca n't go wrong with them
it 's just the right size for sauteing veggies and meat for one cooks evenly and requires little cleanup the preseasoning takes the guesswork out of initially readying castiron cookware for use lodge pro logic properly packaged and sent my merchandise in record time i would definitly buy from them again and recommend them to my friends
the attachments that are available for kitchenaid mixers are worth their weight in gold this is the most recent attachment i 've purchased for my mixer i ca n't tell you how much time was saved when making apple butter and apple relish for the holiday season this time of year , saving time is a good thing when there does n't seem to be enough time for everything on your lists ! ! ! happy holidays
i have had my grill for a week , we 've cooked lean steaks on it , pork chops , and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it this is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the george foreman grill was a bit faster , i was amazed i thought the delonghi cooked pretty fast ! ! clean up was really easy and one must remember to preheat it i gather some have not and as to smoking i have n't had any but then i buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if i think the food will drip a lot of fat fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke i 've only used water once , with the hamburgers \( no smoking \) this really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying \( actual cooking space is 15 x11 \) ease and comfort of use is amazing i highly recommend it !
i got this pan for making cheesecakes in a 5 quart round crock pot \( there are recipes for these on southernfood about com in the crock pot section \) this a good pan for this type of recipe ! it 's an unusual size , more than mini but less than full size it 's a great size for one or two people \( standard recipes and pan sizes always make waaaaay too much for the small household \)
i just finished washing this pan , which i choose to use at an increasing rate it washes up with ease , who needs non stick \? looks beautiful , more importantly , i love cooking in it perfect size ! the only problem is , i wo n't let the men in the household use it , hmmm
i purchased a custom collection of calphalon tri ply pieces in the past six months , starting with smaller pans and working my way up i am so in love with them this everyday pan is a workhorse and you simply cannot beat the ease of cleaning once you get used to it , cleaning the stainless \( versus nonstick \) is just as easy and better because it is dishwasher safe stainless versus nonstick is now my preference virtually all of the time for skillet chicken , this is the absolute best you can do for a perfectly browned end result i have one piece of all clad and i can tell you honestly that i prefer the calphalon tri ply to it though all clad is definitely exceptional you will not regret this purchase
we bought this cuisinart coffee maker after reading the reviews of every single thermal carafe 10 12cup coffee maker out there \( our previous krupps had stopped working , and the current krupps model got bad reviews \)
the product i received was faulty so irobot sent me another one robots are great but i you need to make sure they work right before the warranty is over
this is faster and safer than using a knife , with perfect results every time our favorite gadget this summer
this toaster is definetly well worth the price it is sturdy , compact and full of features and the best of all ! it does n't burn the toast ! very happy with it and the 10 00 less price than at macy 's !
i bought this grinder for flax seed and it works wonderfully what i love most is that after you grind what you need you can place the tight sealing lid that comes with it on and put in right into the fridge nice look , great function and very clean machine
i purchased the cuisinart grinder from amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper 20 ish models picked up at local discount stores motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2 3 months in a storage building the motor on the cuisinart is still going strong , but i had to trash it today i have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1 3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight , but that 's to be expected with a blade grinder the on off button broke about 2 months ago then , last week , the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite john conti beans others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models , but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee ! if i do n't try a higher quality burr grinder , i may get another one of these !
i purchased this french press for my husband several weeks ago and i love it happy with the regular coffee maker , i had little interest in the item until i saw it in action for the first time it 's so easy to use and the flavor of the coffee is much smoother it 's also beautiful i purchased two matching cups at the same time and they remind me of russian tea glasses a collecting favorite of mine i highly recommend this all around good buy
this is a decent unit for those who do n't take the time to read or ca n't understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup \( 4 x 4 is 16 \) the usual sold in the us coffeemaker is a 4 6 ounces per cup capacity coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup a cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe the manufacturer calcultaes what will sell this has been going on since i bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago caveat emptor !
the model 40053 is a good effort , but misses the mark compared to the now discontinued west bend model 40032 triple timer , sold in the 1980s and 1990s i do n't need a real time clock , nor a stopwatch in a kitchen timer , because they just complicate the device
target sells this same item for less than 5 00 32oz bottle it pays to shop around !
i use this pan alot it makes great grilled sandwiches , pancakes and french toast it is also easy to clean and stor
i 've owned electric skillets before and it was always so difficult to clean up that we put them away and only pulled them out for big occasions we bought this skillet a month ago and use it several times a week we have n't had any problems with it at all , and we love the way you can pull the pan off for easy clean up
the vacuvin wine chiller works as advertised and is a realy wine lover 's aid when white wiine is desired but the bottle is not chilled using the vacuvin wine cooler within 5 10 minutes the wine is properly chilled
i did n't have a bundt pan , and i found this one when i went in search of one i'm so glad ! ! ! i 've only had it a week , but have used it 4 times ! ! has a very unique shape
i love this steamer because it fits in all clad sauce pans from 2 to 4 quarts the other version with the long handle does n't fit the 2 quart
if you love to prepare food , these measuring cups are for you they are very well made and are fairly heavy no cheap metal here they feel good in your hand if cooking is as much of an art as a necessity to you , these will make an excellent addition to your kitchen
this maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines i had it is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind my problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke it probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker i have that is why the other one still works and the juan valdez is broken if you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you 'd probably never have a problem with it just be careful in closing it and do n't force it
i got this for christmas over a year ago , and it still works great ! i use it most every morning the coffee quality is n't as good as my drip maker no pod coffee maker can ever measure up to a drip maker but it 's very easy to brew just one cup and with no cleanup \( except to remove the used pod ! \)
when all you 're having is a big bowl of chunky soup for lunch or oatmeal for breakfast , this bowl goes great in the microwave and on to the sofa with you
i 've used my pan twice before reviewing the first time was corn muffins and they came out really well they muffins popped out with ease
i dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply i 've had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine , the only complaint i have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will burn and one be underdone i just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever i'm making right , even though it is off by one number compared to the other side so thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems , but frankly i 've yet to find such a toaster other then that i 've had no problems with this one , i love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem i would recommend this toaster but as i got it as a gift i probably wouldnt spend the 50 but would gladly pay 30 for it i dont think you can really find a better toaster i 've done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning
i researched many roaster pans before i settled on this and am i glad i did it offers a truly stovetop worthy construction , no bending or warping , a great v rack , and superb heat distribution the handles are comfortable and the pan fits perfectly in the oven compared to the allclad , it is less expensive and better performance a well thought out pan
i love the way cast iron cooks not to mention it is so nice to spend less on something that lasts longer and is easier to clean up !
lisa s from ohio complains that the knives rust very easily and that this is a buyer beware item this is not a buyer beware item this is an item that requires some knowledge about use and care of carbon steel knives carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general it does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing , and even wiped with a little olive oil these knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater , and they should never be run through a dishwasher if you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher , buy cheap stainless steel ones
i have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look i am in fact very pleased with the way they look , but even more important is how well they perform they cut wonderfully \( for me at least , but i'm used to cheapy knifes \) yes they will in fact rust , although i have n't had this problem with my set \( had them for about four months now \) because i only handwash them and dry them immediately one steak knife found it 's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot , this was easily removed with a little steel wool you just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic
this little fan does just what i need it for a bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk it clips on very well i even tried it on a 1 2 inch overhang and it stayed on i would reccomend 3 4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation that oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful my reason for no 5 stars is the vibration there is too much especially on high speed this could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip it does n't bother me but might others the cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch i needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan this was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt
i love all my calphalon pots , pans , and bakeware best set i have every owned or used even heat , easy clean up , i have never made reductions as easily as i have in these pots pans
this a a great pot plenty big , and excellent quality my friend bought one too , as i liked it so much
these work great to get that extra out of the bowls i am very particular about my spatulas i love pampered chef items , but do not care for their spatulas they do not seem to slide very well the miu ones slide easily on all surfaces
i bought this hand blender for making split pea soup using the hand blender made the soup so much creamier my husband has diabetes 2 and he loves his sweets i make him the instant , no sugar , no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable so far the blender is working just great
it lives up to the kitchen aid name it chops , it slices and purees you name it i 've made everything in there from dough to sauces and it has been amazing
this knife has a lot to offer as far as i'm concerned
this is a pretty good timer with two timing capability , but the only complaint i have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing however , it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating also , the five minute warning is very useful
yes , it is just a ladle , but a very handy one indeed ! ! ! ! ! i find myself using this ladle just about everyday , than in the dishwasher and on to tomorrows pot it is a great quality tool that i am sure to use a lifetime
ok , cmon now it 's a ladle and works well i own the extire oxo steel line and am pleased with all the products under this line they all perform their function well and with style and they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle fins
i adore this flatware ! the weight , the clean lines , and beautiful shape ! however , it only gets 4 stars because the knives develop rust spots when put in the dishwasher to prevent rusting , i have to hand wash them admittedly , it 's inconvenient and not something everyone wants to do the spoons and forks seem to do just fine in the dishwasher so i do n't know what 's wrong with the knives i'm assuming they 're made differently gourmet settings , the manufacturer , does have a warranty on the flatware so if you buy this set you may want to , or have to , make use of this
i 've had my set for about a year a half i have n't had one speck of rust i wonder if they had a bad batch at some point \? \? i would definately take them back i can see how they 'd be too big heavy for kids but for adults they 're great fit the contours of your mouth very nicely i use mine with fiestaware and they look great together
i bought this for all sorts of uses in the kitchen and am very happy with the quality of the product kitchenaid consistently produces quality products i use it when making bread to scrape it off the board to prevent sticking , for dividing the dough for rolls and loaves overall i'm very pleased with it
i absolutely love this cutting board it works well with most knives \( do n't use the serrated knives with tiny teeth \) the board is very forgiving with repeated cutting they are very heavy and very attractive the only complaint i have is the paper packaging stuck to the board i 've bought 3 of these and i could n't get all of the glue off any of the boards i eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off miu france really needs to use something that will not permanently stick to the boards i 'd give it a 5 star if the sticky residue and paper came off easily
this is a beautiful piece of glassware that adds a touch of class to any table however and this is a significant however a good decanter should be as broad as possible at the level at which a full bottle of wine will fill it the idea is to have as large an air to wine interface as possible , so as to let as much wine as possible breathe this of course is not terribly important for whites and better reds , but younger red wines benefit considerably from being decanted for an hour before they are drunk therefore , i suggest this decanter be reserved for whites and reds that are ready
three months after a purchase and i still have n't seen it
i could definitely tell a difference in the taste of my water , and hopefully that means it 's chlorine free , but i have n't had it tested however , it must be doing its job because the filter itself only lasts about a month ! i think that its life span just depends on how bad your water is it works better that my old brita filter , which i could tell was n't working because my water still smelled like chlorine with that one that being said , i would buy the pur pitcher over again if given the choice
this new pitcher is a an ideal size for smaller fridge plus not very heavy when full water tastes great
i have never owned a crock pot before , so i was a little apprehensive i did a lot of research and finally settled on this item because of size , price and shape of the unit i am extremely happy with the product it is perferct for a first time user not too complicated , but has eveything you need to make the most basic or more complicated recepies it did not smell at all on first use \( many pots have that reputation \) it is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop the inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily i do recommend for first time users that you purchase one good cookbook \( many are carried on amazon \) i purchased several , and my favorite so far is the gormet slow cooker i have tried several recepies and they were all perfect i am converted to crock pot cooking ! !
my slow cooker works perfectly and looks great too the little dipper that came with it has proven to be a very nice bonus i had not expected to use the little dipper but really enjoy hot sauces
these were not from the pattern i have , but matched perfectly to my pattern which has been retired \( italian vine \) but they are very large which is okay if that is what you want i do love them and they are fine quality
i was looking for a non non stick surface griddle to cook pancakes on and i got so much more my husband and i are concerned about the effects of dupont coatings on our children 's long term health \( he is a doctor \) so i have been searching for a stainless griddle for ages finally , i happened upon cast iron as an option i never really understood the benefits of cast iron and it seemed so high maintenance all the seasoning involved i was also reluctant to use it because you are not supposed to really scrub it clean which goes against my personality plus , where would i store my seasoned not so clean griddle when i was not using it well , the thing is when am i not using it \? \( and when i am not i store it in my oven \) i use it almost every day the grill side works great for bacon , salmon , hamburgers , chicken anything when i do n't feel like firing up the grill so far everything turns out perfect , not too dry the griddle side is great for pancakes and eggs and truly non stick without the chemicals of a coating to worry about the bottom line is i love this product more than any other kitchen item since my kitchen aid mixer \( another love of mine \) i plan to buy more as gifts for all my family and friends with gas stoves \( i am not sure how well it works with electric eyes \) truly a kitchen basic if you are thinking of getting one , you should
this is the perfect size food processor and blender for the home cook i like to use it to make homemade basil pesto , hummus , smoothies and shakes
got this as part of a wedding gift and could n't believe how strong and sturdy this is i imagined if it fell out of the window of my kitchen into the street from the 2nd floor that it 'd have a tiny scratch it 's a fine container , nice looking , and i'm glad i got it
good for the price , i wish it didnt get crumbled and was wrinklefree
the cuisinart griddler has proved to be a very handy appliance in my kitchen it 's various heat settings which are accurate is very helpful in perfect results for various tasks we have become addicted to panini ! they come out perfectly steaks are done to perfection ! i have not used the griddle as much , but when i have the results are great
i suspected that a daylight spectrum lamp might be a complete hoax i work in an interior office with no view of natural light that 's 8 10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting !
twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price they are not part of farberware 's higher end line \( obviously from the price any educated consumer will recognize and admit this \) the bottom line is that they do what they 're supposed to do we are replacing a very heavy revereware non stick pan my wife bought 1 5 years ago the teflon wa flaking off she had paid 45 for it we decided that most of the supermarket non stick frying pans we 've had over the years lasted 1 2 years and they were usually 13 20 this farberware set is a great value
i have owned my fair share of indoor grills , from a foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which i ordered through amazon not too long ago i recently acquired the calphalon grill pan because my foreman grill is too small if i want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time plus the black coating on my foreman grill is wearing out so i bought the calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store i have n't been able to get enough of it it is so easy to clean even when i had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed , garlic , shallots , and extra virgin olive oil the marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it was n't non stick i also like using the calphalon grill pan because i can cook both the meat and vegetable \( say asparagus \) at the same time the results are fabulous i get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller , i still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills i have owned well worth the money too
i'm thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets each of the three are the right size for my use small skillet for nice round pancakes , larger skillet for general stir fry , the griddle for bacon , eggs and toasting bread \( with more than enough real estate to cook two of three at the same time could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat \)
i can fill up this little tea pot and in less than five minutes have enough hot water to make four cups of tea no guessing the temperature as is often the case with heating water in microwaves and the automatic shut off makes it great for the office
have had it for three years but have n't used it much the times i have used it , it has worked very well
i have used this griddle so much i have worn it out and am now going to buy another one i have great results making flour tortillas with it i always use the quaker flour torilla mix from wal mart
we needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room , and after a few months of use , i can say this one is working out very well
this pan is nicely made , and is fairly thick silicone but when full , it is floppy and does n't hold its shape on the sides the cake i made turned out with bulges on the sides that i had to trim off to make it a nice , neat rectangle i understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire sleds to support the pans
the cuisinart smo 56 is an overall good value for the price the motor seems very strong , and the speed adjustments are adequate the casing is brushed chrome plastic , but it looks nice it 's not as solid feeling as some of the more expensive blenders
last holiday season , i received this fiestaware scarlet dinnerware set as a gift i absolutely love these dishes they are strong , look wonderful , and put a smile on my face every time i open my cupboard at mealtime not one dish has chipped or cracked and the color is even and vibrant i find the size of each item comfortable to use the fact that they are dishwasher and microwave safe is just another wonderful bonus now i am looking forward to adding more pieces to my collection buy this set ! the quality and price ca n't be beat ! !
i love these dishes they are lead free and you can do so much with them because they are a solid color i liked the sea mist color even more when i saw the actual dishes it is very soothing to the eye , and i do n't think that i will get tired of it as i might with one of the brighter or darker colors
just as advertised ! this sharpener is great ! knives that were very dull now slide right through anything being sliced ! sorry i waited so long to get this sharpener ! the price held me back but it 's worth every penny
you are going to love this mug i bought it in the curry yellow , and ended up buying three more the finish is beautiful and the shape fits your hand so well it is like satin as you hold it and it keeps your tea warm and wonderful the lip is perfect and not too thick buy one and see ! ! chantal products are the best check out their soup bowls
had to turn in the first unit i bought for a replacement because a small plastic piece on the filter basket door broke , rendering the door useless the replacement has worked fine , but i am very careful in swinging the door open
my wife and i selected the krups fme 4 coffee maker to replace the braun kf550 bk model we 've used for the last 2 years the braun was , and still is , an excellent machine but it lacked a timer , which the krups has
we 're a busy family of four this product has so many more uses than our old toaster plus it cooks fast it 's simple to use ! this has been a great alternative to heating up the oven for a few pieces of cheese bread or a snack pizza i was surprised at how evenly everything cooks we 've been very pleased with this product , in fact it has become an essential appliance the only draw back is that it takes up more counter space however that con is overweighed by all the pros i never thought i 'd give up my old toaster , now i wish i 'd done it ten years ago !
i love corelle and purchased this for my son and his new wife the item was not able to be delivered and i received a quick no hassle refund amazon is very easy to deal with !
for those of you that enjoy cooking and the best for your kitchen , these dutch ovens are a must ! excellent for slow cooked stews , roasts and soups wonderful heat retention with the cast iron core and the enamel coating keeps it a snap to clean no sticking and no taste or metal reactions plus the colors are so attractive , they can be a really nice accent in your kitchen
i pretty much agree with ilikeamazon 's review below this blender looks nice , sounds quiet and does n't dance all over the kitchen when being used the lid stays put and it 's easy to clean it also matches all my other small kitchen aid appliances like others though , i make a smoothie every morning and i 've had to learn how to use this blender for that first , it 's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender \( i load it as soon as i get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing i do before leaving the house \)
i was looking for a kettle with a handle that i could pick up without using an oven mitt , and one that does n't require removal of the whistle \( also with oven mitt of course \) before pouring this kettle fit the bill the handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch the whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal
i am quite enamoured with this little utensil i bought it because it was the cheapest silicone spatula i found , but it turned out also to be the best designed the all silicone construction not only protects the handle from melting , and you pot from scratching , but makes it the easiest and most comfortable to use as well
the canister size and shape is very suitable it properly sized to store easily all of our cold cuts the part that i do not like is the time it takes to pull the vacuum it seems that the sides handle are not design to pre load the cover so will seal the gasket design could be improve
this is the best can opener i 've ever used ! with arthritis in my hands and wrists i 've always struggled with can openers \( the electric ones take up valuable counter space and tend to spill the liquid contents \) the oxo is easy to grip , easy to turn the knob and i appreciate the little jaw grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid
i use this for more than just tea , defrosting frozen veggies , making broth , a few drops on a sponge for cleaning , this thing is the greatest
this bakeware is absolutley the best i have ever had it does n't stick , rust , or burn super easy to keep clean , just toss in the dishwasher i you are a baker you must have this , you will be amazed
i have used analon cookware since 1997 the handle came off one of the saucepans before i could return it , my husband tossed it out i replaced the saucepan and purchased some additional items they arrived in great condition and in a timely manner i have used the pots and they have met my expectations i would like to order some of the other accessories
this bundt pan is great the cakes come out cooked evenly , moist , and removes easily from the pan made 3 cakes using this pan everyone loves them ! this bundt pan is going to be used alot more ! ! ! i love it !
i like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers this is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design it would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir
we needed to replace a 30 year old farberware frypan this pan was better than we expected we are so grateful for amazon com ! !
farberware classic is great an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots pans note recently farberware reduced its quality , in that older farberware pots pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell the newer pots pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom , but not encased within a stainless steel bottom so , their quality is less than it was most people who grew up with farberware may not realize this farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base curve up the side of the pan they no longer do this , and are the same as many other manufacturers also note if you are buying a 12 pan , this is a huge pan , since it has a squareish cross section i found it to be so absolutely huge you could fry a dozen onions in this monster that i simply never use it the 10 and 8 sizes may be what you 're looking for
ive had only great hot drinks from my machine ! ! i love it
these sheets are pretty good they 're nice and heavy , and i definitely feel like they 're going to last a looooong time they are a little bit stiff , and they do n't seem to be softening up too much as time goes on i expected them to be a ton softer they are really good sheets , however , and i would buy them again
the extra long rubber portion of this spatula works very well to scrape down the sides of the bowl as it flexes along the curve of the bowl and reaches the bottom easily
this spatula has an easy hold grip , works like it 's supposed to , and washes well in the dishwasher
just compare this one with braun , try to turn it on without the coffee beans and you would notice braun is louder than toastmaker , this is quiet and grinds well just got it a month ago , not sure about the life of the machine but i believe its cheap and best
i love garlic and this has been the best garlic press i 've use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great ! it 's definately worth the money
this garlic press is very well made it 's got some weight to it , but no too much works on the biggest cloves of garlic leaving only the skin behind well worth the money easy to clean
we celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years the cuisinart tob 50 is number 4 it 's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and i'm optimistist we choose it for it 's simplicity , solid feel , and size hoping for reliability and ease of use in it 's early months it is meeting our expectations it is one of the most solid and basic that i 've seen on the market the controls are solid and easy to use it toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily my baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you do n't want to microwave the door and the hinges are solid feeling it is a nice size without being too bulky we store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor it will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size it has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done the crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean the only con i can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely
we had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut i tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking , but found this sort of absurd so i called cuisinart for warranty service they said they 'd replace my oven with a new one , but i had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in nj and it would take a few weeks in the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store , and fixed the problem ! so i was n't going to ship the oven to nj until a replacement oven arrived before i even sent the first one out hmmmm
the lounger is unique and can be used for watching tv or playing with games
i love this thing ! not only does it perform beautifully , but it 's absolutely gorgeous i prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters
i totally love this pan !
i have owned this for years and love it the directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee , you add 5 cups of water and let it sit \( for hours \) i actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine i fill my ice cube trays with the coffee , then bag the cubes so that i can use it over time it is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water \( american coffee \) or less for stronger coffee \( e g , espresso \) i particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee it comes out nice and strong , not watered down
the skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time the quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet its much better then using teflon \( did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds , especially parrots \) well i never liked cooking in teflon and i have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me i am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection its important to realize , looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven those same skillets are still in use today try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to ! ! !
what a delightful gadget works as advertised \( how unusual \) ! creates nice slices of mango without the mess and without ending up with all the small slivers of fruit you normally get love it
i 'd purchased the big brother to this kitchenaid cutting board about a year ago , so i understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label \( it sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself \) the label did eventually come off , but it did take a bit of muscle
we purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house at 14 , he is the oldest of 5 all indoors we put it on the bed \( his favorite daytime nap spot \) he loves it , but so do the other four they all try to squeeze in on it , with him , or take it over when he gets up it 's never empty ! it has a bit of a crinkly noise but they do n't seem to mind it after they try it it seems to work great and very easy to keep clean the patterned side can be de furred with a few quick swipes of your hand , following the direction of the fabric nap good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats
great thing to own and very useful for cooking small quantity of foods i use it a lot
these beautiful square dishes were the inspiration for my purchase of a complete service for 12 plus serving pieces i love them ! they have a very contemporary look , and they are very durable what is also nice is the fact that they are larger than your average luncheon salad plate too
this corelle set has that handcrafted italian detailed look but without worrying about everyday wear and tear it 's time to retire my old butterfly pattern which i 've had for decades i rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in sets of six it 's more profitable for corelle but not so practical for us yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant
i have , and do use , many different fillet knives but needed one for knife block in the kitchen it had to match my other 4 stars it not only matched but the construction if great and is an excellent performer
my friend purchased the breadman panini maker a few months ago every time we spoke he was making some kind of panini sandwich he raved about this panini maker so i had to get one for myself i love it ! it is so easy to clean it is such a wonderful item that i would 've paid double the price if i new how well it worked it 's hard for me to believe that anyone could be disappointed with this item
these are well made spoons , not junky at all , which is always a possibility with cheap , mail order items of this type the steel is heavy gauge , and all the edges are rounded and safe good value and a good way to top up an order
this little unit is very versatile , you can use it to steam anything
this sturdy nylon whisk , like the rest of the products from the oxo good grips line , is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability , and flawless performance its ergonomic design , hefty body , and big , pressure absorbing , non slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers , are the reasons why you 'll prefer this product to the more traditional models , as they will allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress related injuries
i have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee , so dunkin donuts was where i would head to on my way to work i got this coffee pot and i buy dunkin donuts coffee and grind it with the proline kitchenaid grinder and it is the best coffee i have ever had recently i had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from dunkin donuts i asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots well , i assured him he would love it after having my coffee , for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee , actually said , he preferred my coffee after the job was over , he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee i made this is the best ever , perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature
if you 're like myself , the 5 a m pot of coffee has to be simple
we now have two of these units they are quieter than other hepa air filtration units we have had , do a better job of cleaning the air , and have excellent product support
even on its highest setting , it is n't very loud handy electronic screen shows how much longer it is until the filter needs to be washed or vacuumed i used to wake up in the mornings because i had a stuffy nose due to all the dust where i live , and now that 's gone i would say this is a worthy investment to anyone who is looking into buying a hepa filter , but does n't want to go broke from the filter costs
i love this mug
a fork is a fork , right \? this does what you 'd expect the all clad difference is that it is beautiful and because it 's stainless , it 's a very hefty knife i think with will hold a large heavy cut of meat well i use mine for chicken sparkles when you put it in the diswasher
i have been looking high and low for a new flatware set and the minute i seen quot non stop quot i had to have it ! needless to say i am very pleased
we have three dogs so the fur is endless i come home from work and start the roomba and voila , no more dog hair it picks up more stuff than my other vacuums ever did
this is horrible as stated by the other reviews ! ! ! do not waste your money or time ! ! ! my husband and i tried for several hours to get this to work , we let the dough come to room temperature , and still it would not work !
if you 're in the market for a used nissan coffee mug , then step right up and order from amazon com !
i 've had two of these break on me now after normal use the hinge gives way during the cleaning process
although this is a nice looking product , and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise , i went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point \( the hinge \)
my kitchen is entirely kitchenaid , so i was very excited when kitchenaid released their silicone bakeware line i love the color and the way they clean up very nicely i also love that they do not get scratched or clank around in my cupboards however , i have noticed that when i bake in these , i can smell the silicone it even dominates over the smell of the cake or bread that i am making ! i have also noticed \( especially with this bread pan \) that the silicone gives your dessert a slight silicone taste i own the muffin pans , so i use paper baking cups to prevent this from happening , but with the loaf pan , there is no way around it
cup leaks out of the top closure part i need one that does not leak at all , most of the time my hands are full and it 's a balancing act very disappointed for this amount of money it is not worth the aggravation
i am writing this to warn all of you cooks and bakers at home , that like me , prefer real commercial equipment in your kitchen anything less is just a toy i had purchased the waring pro 1500 convection oven thinking this would be a quality convection oven to replace a farberware convection oven that i have had for over 10 years and just plain wore out i ordered the waring pro 1500 from a catalog online store other than amazon , i do n't know if it is legal to say , but it does have the word chef 's in it i was so excited to get it ! i opened the box , set it up , and was so disappointed it was made so poorly i was just sick the stainless steel top was not smoothed out , the oven door was installed so crooked it scraped the metal off of the side of the controls , and it had been dropped or something before packing because the feet were up inside of the thing , and the top was bent down the shipping packaging was fine , there was no broken packing and the box was fine ok , so i sent that one back , got a replacement thanks to the wonderful customer service at the online store , and opened the second one , same thing ! ! i was so devastated , that i decided to give it a shot anyhow while cooking with it , the door had such a bad seal that it just steamed out the front , sides and bottom i was amazed that there could be such shoddy workmanship out there on what was being advertised as commercial quality ok , so oven number two went back , and i tried one more , what the heck three strikes you are out right \? right ! ! finally oven number three came and it was put together so much better , seal looked good , top and feet looked good , so i decided to give it a whirl once again , huge disappointment the convection fan goes on and off with the burner coils thus not giving the cooking cycle a true convection i called waring customer service and it was confirmed by engineering that they designed the fan to come on and off with the coils bad design ! it took longer to bake cookies in there than it would my regular oven , and then they were hard and dry i rotisseried a chicken and it took over 1 and a half hours and when i cut it , the skin was soggy , not crisp , and it was n't cooked all the way through after 90 minutes ! the thing popped \( sounded like it was going to blow up \) every time it heated up because they riveted the rack holders in there so tight , also making it nearly impossible to go from racks to using baking trays ok , that was it ! ! after extensive internet research , i finally found a convection oven that is truly a commercial oven made for residential use , and exchanged it with the wonderful catalog online store mentioned before and got the cadco commercial \( and i do mean commercial \) half size convection oven model number ov 350 and have used it many times since it 's arrival and absolutely love it ! ! i know it is twice the price , but as usual , you get what you pay for there is a smaller size version of the cadco broilking oven that is quarter size , for people that do not need to bake huge quantities like me , that is the same price as the waring pro please people , if you are at all a person that demands quality in your kitchen , do not waste your time on the waring pro , just skip right to the real commercial stuff and save yourself some major stress ! ! thanks again to the wonderful customer service at the aforementioned catalong online company for not making me be stuck with the worthless waring pro 1500 ! ! go for the cadco !
we never even plugged this sucker in i wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan , and this unit was supposed to do that what none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this countertop unit should not be used underneath a cupboard do n't most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them \? also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4 clearance on the sides so whatever the dimensions of the unit are , you need to add 8 i'm sending this monster back and getting something smaller
unfortunately , if you have an older gas oven like we do , the temperature of your oven may actually be higher than the temperature at which you set it on the dial this led to problems determining a safe temperature in which to use the trays we were all hesitant to eat the muffins i 'd made because of the chemical plastic smell i'm back to using foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet
the fs150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you do n't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out the two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor gear train first the slider is simply a cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly we found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards food grade teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil
i was actually satisfied with this slicer until i needed to clean it when you remove the blade , there is a plastic ring or seal that clings to a metal rim with brittle , plastic fingers an intelligent engineer would have seated this ring in a channel rather than have it mounted by flimsy , brittle fingers to a thin semi circle of metal
this thing slices well , then comes the impractical task of trying to clean it the tray does not detatch from the base , which cannot be put in water because it containes the motor pieces of food work their way into the motor area after removing the blade \( using tools \) you must remove a plastic cover with 3 screws and dig out the pieces of food i could not believe how bad a design it was from a cleaning standpoint the tray that slides back and forth with the food has a stainless top that is literally two faced taped onto the plastic base this was very poor from a quality standpoint , and came off in my hand the first and only time used the plastic base for this tray has about fifty little half inch square honey comb sort of areas that grease from meat or juices from food will get down into this thing is a nightmare to adequately clean and not worth the trouble it went back to the store immediately , and it was not all the way clean because after about thirty minutes i gave up i'm looking for another brand now
i bought this product because the box says no more ice chunks there is even an icebreaker setting i wanted a way to make slushies however , the manual says you are to use the icy drink setting when crushing ice i am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the icebreaker setting !
the price of this iron was reduced to 24 99 with the purpoose of missing the 25 order for free shipping , then they trap you into buying another item or pay over 7 for shipping now , to make matters worse , they omitted the most important feature of the iron that the soleplate is aluminum
these tools are made of high quality materials , and they look very nice however , the ends of the handles are so thick and heavy that if you leave them propped on the side of a shallow pot or pan , or on the counter , they are very prone to flip out of the container or off of the counter , carrying food with them to the kitchen floor this happened to me twice while cooking thanksgiving dinner i will not throw them away , but i would never buy them again
would look great if it lined up correctly goes together very crooked does n't line up 100 with other parts , there are only three major parts i ordered two holders , both have the same problems may redrill the screw holes to line things up better , but may just return both for a refund
after getting the teakettle in january , i had to stop using it by june the kettle was leaking water all over the kitchen counter and at time it would not turn off by itself delongi sent me a new kettle to replace the one that was broke but it was a model only worth 80 00 when i ask about the 50 00 difference in price of the two teakettles i was told they covered their warranty and i'm out of the 50 00 i wo n't be buying anymore of delongi products !
like the other reviewers , i followed the instructions for this machine to the letter i froze the canister in my deep freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it although the recipe provided was quite tasty , even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage , let alone ice cream my kids pretty much drank it from the bowl it 's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes no way returned it the next day \( and paid for shipping \)
let me begin with a positive note on the oxo good grips oven mitt it looks great and the magnet is a good idea now for the negative aspects of this item it 's way over priced , especially for how poorly it is designed the way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a good grip , which is ironic since it 's called the oxo good grips oven mitt it 's hard to explain , but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt , you cannot easily grab things , especially if what you 're trying to grab is small \( like a pan lid \) or narrow \( like the handles on a roaster pan \) it 's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven i decided not to give it one star only because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures i strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this oxo mitt , you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design
i bought this pan as a christmas gift for my husband it would have been easier if i had just put a match to my money and burned it he has given up using this pan he even read the directions thinking he was doing something wrong every egg he placed in it stuck to the side of the teflon rings what a shame the only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan do n't waste your money
as of today august 19 , i have not received anything on this plan
we have had ours less than one year and we hate it for all the reasons everyone else have listed it does n't toast evenly etc do n't buy it
this unit from cooking com is made from china consider it to be a disposable unit the threads on it are worthless i got one single use out of them i thought it to be a fluke ordered another one same thing frustrated !
i am very disappointed in this product i followed all the mfgs directions on how to keep this board in great shape but it did n't matter the board bowed and cracked after about 2 months \( 30 days over the amazon warranty of course \) it 's so badly curved we are waiting for it to turn into a sphere
assembling and disassembling this piece of equipment would discourage a person from ever using this item it is far too complicated and has too many pieces that have to be washed each time it is used and then put back together again one can expect to spend about 30 minutes to disassemble and reassemble the unit while following the assembly guide in addition to that drawback , there is n't anything that should be placed in a dishwasher , so it has to be hand washed and hand dried an osterizer would be a much simpler and better choice ! ! !
i purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs i used large , farm fresh eggs whatever combination of water and timing i tried , i never got a perfectly cooked poached egg the cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout specifically page 5 i called cuisinart and after much back and forth , it was determined the eggs i used were too large and the directions were for medium sized eggs if considering this machine , be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat
the cuisinart egg cooker
this stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream built with quality materials like real metal \( not silvery plastic \) , and sporting a sophisticated , drop dead gorgeous retro appeal it looks equally as impressive in the hippest new york loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of williams sonoma
warring has a high reputation for being a powerful blender i purchased because of its reputation but it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one i had before which only costed 30 so i asked myself why bothered to replace it when the new one , warring , in fact does not really break ice any better than the cheap ones
this steamer sucks puts white goo all over the outside of unit and on counter wish i did n't buy it
we lived in asia for five years and we eat a lot of rice in asia we owned a very cheap rice cooker that worked perfectly well \( but different voltage \) when we returned to the usa , i purchased the cuisinart 8 cup rice cooker \( crc 800 \) thinking i was getting top of the line it made such an enormous mess every time we used it , so i called cuisnart to find out if somehow \( despite meticulous reading of the instructions \) we were doing something wrong no , it seemed we were doing everything correctly so we tried a few more times , and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one we thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances , this one must be defective
i would have to say that amazon gave me a good deal and immediate delivery
do not waste your time in purchasing this product at first , i thought this would be a great kitchen gadget for making small cones for my kids or when i just want a little treat , but i was wrong the manufacture did n't think that as soon as the waffles are done , you have to be quick and roll the waffles into cones for it too cool well , instead of making one , you have to roll three in enough time before it cools i tried numerous times to roll each one quickly as possible , but by the second one the third waffle is cooled and has not had the chance to be rolled up into a cone it really is not smart for the manufacture to sell this product , unless it comes with three cone makers to wrap the waffle in and , to state that you need three people to make it or it will not work do not bother purchasing this product , unless you are an expert cone maker i did , however , went ahead and purchased the regular sized cone maker it is hard to perfect the perfect cone without having a hole at the bottom , but at least i have time to wrap up one cone at a time without having it cool on me to quickly also , the petite cone waffle maker is rediculously too small to try to wrap it really is a waste of energy you could put batter in only one of the cone indentions , and do it one by one if its what you are looking for that could work all in all , personally it was n't worth my time and money spent on the thing
the item was not what i expected the description said metal but it should have said tin
cuisinart does not stand behind their products we purchased a 10 pc set and after using the 1 qt pan only once it formed a bubble on the bottom of the pan causing the pan not to lay flat on the stove this actually renders the pan useless as it does not evenly disperse the heat and takes forever to even heat up
i researched a lot before buying this slow cooker i have a nesco roaster that i love and use often i needed a large slow cooker i started researching started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot i wanted a good one the cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and i thought well even it cooks faster that is fine i will just watch it until i get used to it and go from there every dish i have watched they all cooked in less than half the allotted time today i made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within one hour way too hot i called cuisinart several times and they said i may have a defective unit well i doubt it i just think it runs hot i really was dismayed because i love the size and the design of this cooker really was not up to par with cuisinart products that i know and love
mine did n't hold up either for what i paid for it , i expected more one i picked up for around twenty is doing a much better job and lasted through more than four uses
i have gone through 2 of these now and both ceramic inserts have cracked in the same place ! cuisinart customer service is not interested in replacing the inserts even though i have only used it 2 times before they cracked and were unusable i had to send the pot back for replacement and the replacement had the same trouble
i own many circulon products , but most of which are under the circulon 2 line so when this 2 pack became available , i went ahead and purchased it i have only used it to cook eggs on and i must say , i was sorely disappointed by the results not only did my eggs stick , but i used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they would n't stick , but they still stuck my circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non stick version and does n't stick !
after using my 3 new circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months , all the circulon lids have broken plastic handles , including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan
i own 3 other malibu shores comforter sets and i just love it with no problem but , with this particular set i'm so disappointed with the quality of the material is poor , the areas where two materials were sewn together is tearing apart , and the stitchings are coming apart in many different parts of the comforter not to mention the padding is already separating after two weeks of usage
this set looks gr8 only in the foto in reality , it has a very dull look not worth buying i got 2 queen sets and greatly disappointed with this purchase from amazon ! price is cheap , so is the quality of the comforter set !
i should have simply repaired our old toaster that worked well , and reliably , for eight years too busy , first i bought a braun toaster \( looked great , had major problems actually toasting \) , then i bought this krup toaster , and guess what , it looks great but has trouble actually toasting starting with the first piece of toast all is well \( hence two stars instead of one \) however , after the toaster is warmed up , the timing heat regulation becomes totally useless you have to toast , toast again , toast again fancy digital count down timer does n't help much at that point ! in researching toasters , did i mention i should have repaired my old toaster when it broke , i read a review where it was suggested that 'toasters have been around a hundred years , it ca n't be that hard ! ' i thought it funny at the time , but having now spent over 150 on two worthless toasters i find myself saying toasters have been around for over a 100 years , it ca n't be that hard ! i hope braun and or krup do n't make medical devices or we are in trouble
i put a fairly warm pound cake on the bottom of the cake keeper apparently too warm cracks developed from opposite edges and met in the middle , creating a separation and thereby rendering the keeper useless
just purchased this blender am returning it immediately it has a number of terrible features it 's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel , arthritis , or weak hands to change speeds you turn a dial \( as opposed to the buttons on most others \) , which makes for rough transitions moreover , the dial feels very flimsy and i doubt this machine will last i purchased this model because i thought its premium price would mean a premium product , but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial , to the impossible to open cover , i hate it will go back to either an oster or waring , both of which served me well , each for over 10 years
i wish i had read the review by mary twain before purchasing the pro form rose bundt because it was made by nordic ware , i thought it would be the same as the cast aluminum but it 's not do n't be fooled b c the cake will not look like a rose the pan is more shallow the ring is bigger than the cast aluminum since i only paid 9 99 for this , i did n't want to waste paying for shipping to get a refund
buyer beware ! the item pictured is not what you will get ! it contains the same information , but it is formatted differently i asked for a replacement , asking for what is pictured and received the incorrect one again
you get what you paid for nice pattern , but the bedding is somewhat rough to the touch would n't give it as a gift
to start with , the one star rating is actually for the customer service department when it works , the product itself is fine
we raved about making panini 's introduced many of our friends to them then it died without warning in the middle of dinner we paid 80 for the thing too
we used our beloved panini maker probably once a month or so for about a year , but it died without warning , and way too soon
thankyou for the reviews about quality i wanted to share with krups why i would n't buy there panini maker but when i tried to email customer service it was to complicated to let them know i also read there warranty and it appears your grills should be covered under one year but of course it adds at there discretion i am still deciding which to get but cuisinart has a 3 year warranty
very noisy and takes too long to brew boxed it up to return but i misplaced the packing slip will keep using mom 's very old corelle electric percolator
this item turned to rust after the first use i do not recommend this product
the soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet \( children would love this feature \) you have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually you cannot use this pump with one hand not good for kitchen use
i had one a few months ago when i filled in water , the water just passed the filter quickly i was not sure if the water is filtered one day , i wanted to clean it i put it in hot water for about 10 minutes the pitcher was out of shape and i had to discard it i believe the pitcher was made from cheap materials i sent an email to the custom no service of brita i got no response i will not buy brita products any longer
i also tried some cotton wamsutta sheets from bed bath , and beyond and they pilled the first time i washed them i was able to return them to the store , but it was a waste of time i would n't recommend these sheets or any wamsutta sheets because i think they 're poor quality
did not fit the pot i needed it for too much money for shipping on small item to justify sending back
i purchased this knife , and when it arrived , the package said , not recommended for left handers if henckels chooses to design only for right handed people , that 's their right , but they should disclose it clearly second , amazon com should include such information in their editorial review i'm left handed , and i 'll add this to my can opener and vegetable peeler as one way kitchen gadgets
the waffle baker \( formerly waffle iron \) works great make that 'worked great ' for an entire month , then it died it was , of course , under warranty no problem , we were told , we will ship a new one to your door
i spent several hours searching researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice i finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice , and had brown rice measurements which are different than for regular white rice i am disappointed first of all , the manual recommends not using the keep warm function when using brown rice this means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over this defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker but even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly it does not it is either too wet mushy , or too dry and burnt we have been unable to cook a proper batch yet , after much experimentation with slightly more or less water , and using 3 different types of brown rice look elsewhere , and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice
the other reviewer was luckier than i was mine warped immediately , which forced off the end pieces
we registered for a set of 10 wmf utensils for our wedding they look great hanging in our kitchen and most all of the utensils are very functional however , we are now on our second scooper and it has broken now for the second time its just not sturdy enough for its intended use ice cream
the first time i used it , the weld holding the scoop to the handle broke , leaving the scoop in the ice cream and the handle in my hand
this product would not cut through a sweet potato it barely went through a piece of a regular potato while cutting through a potato it was bending and felt like it would break it 's fairly cheap , but you get what you pay for i ended up using a knife instead it 's your 8 99
i loved this iron until it died after owning it for a little over a year i bought this iron because consumer reports rated it 1 it was a great iron while it worked \( i iron about once a week sometimes twice a month \) i 've had irons last for years and i usually get rid of them because they lack the bells and whistles not because they fail to work black decker customer service acted like i was the only one whoever had a problem with one of their products and told me to go buy another iron because it was over a year old i'm sorry , but i think with light use , an iron should last more than a year forget black decker i'm trying rowenta or bosch
this unit simply does not do the job press makes irregular shaped tortillas and they cannot be easily removed from the wax paper better job can be done with 2 dinner plates save your money
this is a cheap piece of junk the base wo n't communicate with the remote even after extensive review of directions and trying different channel selections as directed the plastic housings are so lightweight i do n't think it 'd survive ordinary outdoor use either certianly not a drop off your grill felt like i had to handle it gingerly so i did n't crush it with my hands this one is going back sorry az
if the probe was not so fragile i 'd give this unit 5 stars the remote works well although i have had it lose contact with the sender if i was out in front of my house \( my grill is on the back deck \) this is a minor annoyance , but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed \( indicating high reading \) in conditions where my miu france unit keeps on going unfortunately the miu france unit does n't have the remote capability i purchased about 5 extra probes for the taylor unit directly from taylor by mail but within a few weeks several of those failed i do n't mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying i 'd suggest staying away from this unit
i love to grill but i keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment i had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter first , it took more than 1 2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other secondly , and worst of all , on just my second attempt using it i was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to high i immediately went out to check it and the probe is dead ! ! ! there 's no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer ! ! taylor is no help !
this product is a disgrace nonstick is not one of its virtues , and those who are thinking of purchasing this waste of money should be forewarned it is not even well designed for broiling with small openings for fat drainage that quickly clog up i am honestly surprised that amazon would allow such an unworthy product to be sold under its banner
it looks like a krups what with the stainless steel look and the fancy electronics , but , as a rice cooker , it does not perform as expected the rice is passable but certainly not the best we 've had our very old national rice cooker produced better rice also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder \( unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker \) gets old very quickly lastly , the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice \( it may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker but we thought we were buying a rice cooker \)
all the airbake products i have used thus far have proven awful over time after only several uses , cookies stick \( even after religious greasing of the sheet \) and the sheets are impossible to clean without scratching or rubbing off the surface now i have to place a silpat on top to save myself the headache i 'd save my money and spend it on a heavier duty , higher quality baking sheet
airbake products are horrible ! i have used the cookie sheets multiple times and i have had nothing but problems there products over brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans i have better luck using my old cheap non stick bakeware than airbake buyer beware ! if you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous the handle is much too small for this size mug if you can get your finger through the small hole , your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware the first and only time my family used these mugs , two of us burned ourselves
i love vornado products but this does n't qualify very little breeze you have to turn the fan around to turn it off which means that about half the time i get whacked by the cloth blades it should have a power switch on the cord instead it 's a trendy gadget that will only please people who are not vornado customers
i encounter too much resistance when trying to pull towel out for tearing there is so much resitance that the base moves , unless i perform the procedure with both hands
i read all of the reviews and thought this was the paper towel holder for me boy , was i wrong it looked beautiful when it arrived and i could n't wait to use it well , i put on my first roll of paper towels and pulled one off the racheting system worked ok until it came towards the end of the roll the racheting stopped and jammed and the paper towels ripped in half instead of where they were supposed to i am going back to the old paper towel holders that just have a stick holding the roll and not a racheting whisk like bar jesh , all i want is a paper towel not aggravation which is what i got with this item
i bought the villaware double smoothee maker and it was a problem from the moment i pulled it out of the box first , the silver lable was not glued on the product and would n't stick next when i made the product using their receipe it would n't dispense from the spout and the spout connecting to the blender leaked tried calling the seller and emailing them about my problem and they would n't help i called the manufacture and since i bought it here from a vendor they would help so now its in the blender heaven of trash somewhere out there what a waste of money thank god for amazon's abc guarantee ! !
this attachment vibrates so badly that it about bounces the food processor right off the counter i love the food processor but i regret having bought the juice extractor
when i opened the box , i noticed corrosion on the lid when i contacted rival customer service via email , they told me i had to purchase a new lid i called and spoke with a customer service representative and they told me that a lid was not covered under warranty when i explained that i just opened it and it was defective they told me to just return the product that there was nothing that they were going to do
when i received this item it was packaged with the wrong power cord , which did n't fit the unit so i was n't even able to use this unit
i have tried and tried but the thing just makes weak coffee
my husband bought this machine because it was supposed to be fast and convenient , and with different schedules , easier to brew one cup at a time it worked fine at first , but now after just 3 weeks it leaks hot water all over the counter this has happened to both my husband and me so it 's not bad technique on our parts we follow directions exactly , but we keep having to stop it , open the lid , check the pods , reclose the lid and try again this takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter this just is n't acceptable , but it 's mostly plastic so probably to be expected we have used other pods besides the senseo pods \( which do n't produce good coffee \) but that should n't be an issue as they 're all the same size anyway , we 're trashing it and have ordered the bunn professional which will hopefully do a much better job i 'll let you know in a future review my advice on this one is either do n't buy it or if you do , based on other positive reviews , keep the box and the receipt so you can return it when it starts malfunctioning

i purchased these pans based on my previous positive experiences with calphalon cookware have tons of it , but i experienced the same problem as two other reviewers that is , the slumping in the middle i have been cooking for over 30 years and have never experienced this problem , especially since i have a new kitchen aid convection oven also , the non stick is not so non stick at their prices , i think they have a little work to do to meet other calphalon products
i am sorry to say that i was not satisfied with this pan at all ! the cakes i bake are browning , even burning on the edges before the middle is even done ! the edges are rising but the middle is slumping down i own the calphalon cookware and that is nice but they have a stinker in their bakeware my recommendation look at a different pan
yes , it looks good in my blue kitchen but the water does n't pour cleanly out of the spout it 's more like uncontrollable spewing , even when poured slowly , and boiling water splashes all over the counter also very difficult to fully empty sorry i threw out the box , or i 'd send back
this toaster at the lowest setting of 1 burns my toast it also burned one side of a frozen bagel when i put it on defrost
i have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders i have always loved cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one , what a mistake ! the grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it 's size the coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top , making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee
i was excited to upgrade to this coffee grinder after years of using a cheap krups model , and i have to say that i am very disappointed with the way this machine grinds coffee it takes way too long to grind , whether pulsing or grinding continuously and then the grounds are very uneven although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in , every coffee expert i 've consulted with says the longer coffee grinds , the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost even after long grinding , there are large pieces of bean still visible i was also excited about the machine 's detachable bowl , which does make for easy cleaning but only of the bowl the rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top , your counter is covered in grounds i bought a second bowl so that i could grind spices in the same machine , and i think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds \( such as flax \) than it does on coffee but you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it , or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case \( that plastic case does make grinding quieter , however \) all in all i'm quite disappointed with this purchase i should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder , or stuck with my cheap krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly
cuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product my criticisms of this machine
the 4 cup coffee press is in actuality just 2 cups the number of ounces is not listed in the sales blurb what we wanted was 4 cups at 8 ounces each the 4 cup coffee press is just a bit over 16 ounces while it says so on the lid of the box it came in , the ounce capacity is not in the amazon listing so we returned it
the replacement filters for the sv726 do not fit and are not the same shape as the filter that came with the shark vac
50 of the bags leak the plastic is thin and rips easily do n't even think about using these for uder the bed storage the bags will get tears on them if you just breate on them heavy
this product was horrible i ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such however , it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it when i took the featherbed out of the box , it was terribly thin i currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy this item unfortunately felt as though i was simply lying on a blanket
it 's 54 99 in last week , i 'll wait till the price drop bac
the only thing i do not like of this pitcher is its lid the lid is not quite sealed so that the water could leak from the back and wet your sleeve even worse , sometimes the lid fell off you have to be careful while using it not recommend
i used a west bend triple timer for about 25 years and was well satisfied with it it had a loud alarm the new model has a clock \( not very useful \) , a stop watch function \( moderately useful \) and a triple timer function \( fairly useful \) unfortunately the timer functions are more difficult to set than on the older unit the alarm is very weak , very difficult for me to hear i am looking for another alarm
i saw the 3 star reviews here , but decided to ignore them as this pan was on sale for a very good price that was a big mistake
if i could give no stars for this , i would i 've been using electric skillets for more years then i care to say i love cooking with them and when my last one simply wore out from so much use , i bought this one what a mistake after only minimal use , the middle of the pan began to burn extra hot and all the food was sticking and burning then the coating began to peel from the pan the middle began to buldge slightly so the surface was not flat for even frying what a nightmare ! ! this pan was less then two months old ! and i do know how to treat and cook with electric skillets just in case you were thinking i did something to cause this i have never been so disappointed in a product before however , it did have a new place in our home the trash can guess i should have read the reviews first now that was my mistake ! !
i'm an old hand with kettles , i thought i 'd give this one to my spouse for our anniversary , but it was a bit of a dud when the kettle was ready to boil the lid would fall down , steam would go everywhere and it would often take ages to turn itself off looked great but think i'm going to get the braun instead
after 5 washings , these towels still shed like a mother grrr
when i received this coffee maker , it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out , then then heating element stopped working it took numerous calls to braun , then of course i had to pack it up and ship it off several weeks later it was returned to me and once again , it worked one time again , it took several phone calls and i had to pack it up and send it off again i received a new unit that does indeed heat up , but has several other problems the drip shut off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks , the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee , and if one uses a paper filter , it tends to overflow the filter basket this is the worst coffee maker i 've ever owned
we have a full line of fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice after a year of standard use and dishwashing , about 1 3 of the flatware is unusable the upside is that it is cheap and replaceable but count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts we are in the process of ditching the fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust
the pepper lid seemed a little loose and i worried that it would fall off , dumping pepper everywhere i probably would have kept them anyway because they are nice looking and a decent price , but i could n't get the lid off the salt shaker at all
i ended up giving it to salvation army takes more than one cake mix more like 1 and a half to fill it up i did n't think it was worth the money
look , the product plainly reads oster blender blade with gasket and the package that was delivered is titled processing unit with sealing ring the blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring gasket to be found i'm sure there is the possibility that i got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that \? ! i'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem i now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of 1 50 and will pay shipping of probably 3
this product will not work with home vacuum sealers that use a textured bag this is a thin plastic sheet on a roll you have to cut , fold and seal the sides of the plastic sheet
this gadget is better than nothing as a sink strainer \( unlike the miserable sinktastic , which i find hopelessly misdesigned \) but it 's still far inferior to any good stainless steel mesh strainer \( do a web search for sink mesh strainer \) this one slides around on top of the sink drain , letting gunk slide in around it yet it 's impossible to pick up without using your \( ewww \) fingernails and those fingernails will be picking up a rusting metal edge , if yours grows old at all like mine did
i totally agree with the previous reviewer this pan is terrible i also ended up with only tops i suppose you could put paper muffin cups in , but what would be the point of buying this pan then \? \? \? also , these do not nest like a regular metal pan \( the sled takes up a lot of room \) do not buy this
i received the gelato maker in the mail and was eady to try it out got all the ingredients together and in the bowl and loaded it into the machine i turned on the machine as per the directions and it beeped and flashed at my just like it is supposed to do when it has been on too long and the machine is freezing up i was not very happy with this predicament at all
mine died after 6 months half the heating elements stopped working , toasting only one side of the bread took it apart no loose or broken wires , so must have been the circuitry chucked it in the garbage
i have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them i ordered this one i received it the first of sept 2006 and on nov 10 plugged it in , it sparked at the pot and that was it gone ! ! i am sick about this as i had thought cuisinart was a step above the rest
i am very pleased with the dishes years ago i owned corelle dishes , and am now wondering why i went the way of the heavier dishes they do n't scratch or take up a lot of space i bought two sets i love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at , especially since i purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match it really makes for a beautiful table i get compliments all the time i was also very pleased with how quickly i received the dishes in about 3 days i am always happy with my purchases made through amzon com
i expected the dishes to be more substantial the plates are very light and thin , more like melamine in feel the colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what i expected very disappointed with the cups i bought two sets , and only 1 of the 8 cups had almost the same color intensity as the dinner plates the others were so faded \( kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink \) they looked like , either rejects , or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 time
we bought this to use at events for a chocolate themed group at college , and used it several times before giving up
the pad sent to me did not match the description or photo the neck on the pad is very narrow the photograph depicts a different type of ironing board than the one the cover actually fits i bought two of these and had to return them both as they did not fit the board i was stuck paying the shipping , thus penalizing me for a product that was misrepresented
arrived defective , right out of the box will not oscillate something inside is obviously amiss so why even bother with it
the other reviews are correct , except they fail to mention that the fan does not move air that is why it is so quite i do suppose that i got 13 dollars worth of fan though think twice about purchasing this fan
difficult to start and difficult to maintain flame would think twice before buying again especially difficult if one is left handed
my son , who is a culinary graduate , purchased a set of oxo knives for me as a gift i know they were not inexpensive however , within a year , three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use while the grips are quite nice , the knives are dangerous to use and can cause serious injury in the kitchen they should be removed from the market in all three cases , the blades flipped upwards during slicing
sorry to disagree with other reviewers , but my experience of the paring knife was that it 's perhaps the softest metal i 've ever seen used in a knife , and as a result , it 's not very sharp and does n't improve if you try sharpening it my friend , a fellow cook who got it as a gift , does n't like it i hated it and would never choose to use it there 's a reason the price is so low
this grinder worked well for about two months before the internal spring that holds the nutmeg in place became loose now there is so little pressure against the nutmeg , that the blade can no longer do any grinding in addition , the size and shape of the entire mill are awkward for my small hands
this product has a cute name , but it is very difficult to use i constantly have to take the nutmeg out and re adjust it larger nutmegs do not fit in the storage area it 's a lot of work to get a little bit of nutmeg disappointing
received this toaster as a christmas present in 2004 from day one i was not very happy with it the knobs and temperature control are difficult to use sometimes it would bake good , other times it would not about 6 months ago i noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial about 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time today the timer dial broke off completely so i got about a year and a half of poor use out of it so , do n't purchase this product , it is not worth it
unfortunately , i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead this was not amazon 's fault , but emile henry 's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not in fairness to amazon , they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled
it is really the worst coffee maker i had it is too slow , the automatic stopper always breakes and the coffee pot is useless , because you can not pour in a cup without making a mes
the professional 5 qt series has a wider bowl than the regular 5 quart i was given no info that it would not fit this model i was dissapointed as i feel this attachment would be helpfu
i bought this item for my daughter for christmas and after she removed it from the box i took a look at it to check it over and i discovered there was missing paint where the band is that goes around the top of the mixer do i get the feeling that the mixer i purchased was a defect i ordered another one for my other daughter and i will have her check that over also i am not happy with this and i will have to look into this matter
i was so excited when i found a contemporary stainless pattern to add to my gift registry when i received the 20 piece set at a shower i was very ecited until i washed them and never got to eat off them because they rust ! ! ! ! i called gourmet settings and they are sending me another set but i am removing the 45 piece set from my registry i will use them for picnic silverware not dining roon silverware
i have tried to purchase this item since may 2006 without explanation , after my order was processed and i was given a date of delivery the order was cancelled and i received a notice that the board was not available
i recently got this set and the 2 piece carving set of the same series i know i should not have expected much for this great price , but the knives do not have anywhere as good a feel as the classic line of wusthof or the henckels 4 or 5 star knives they are very light in weight , mostly due to the handles much better than a target or kmart knife , and great to start , but i expect to switch mine out with 'real' knives as my budget will allow
i do not think any human being can fall asleep on this trash actually i can not even lie on this for more than 1 minute and i feel low back pain
i baked two batches of madelines side by side , one in this pan \( set on a baking sheet \) , and another in a traditional pan with non stick coating i brushed both pans with canola oil before using as per the package instructions , i allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them the madelines in the traditional pan released easily , were golden and high , and had a pronounced design the other batch were almost soggy \( probably from cooling in the pan \) , flat , pale , and did not have the appearance of a madeline to make matters worse , they did not release easily , and a few of them even broke as i attempted to remove them i would not recommend this pan
what the heck is going on \? i ordered this item 3 weeks ago , it has not delivered yet so i ca n't even make a review on this item
why do manufacturers always have to change a good thing \?
flimsy mine started rusting after 2 months but then again , what can one expect for this price
although this grill has all the design elements i wanted easy to use , quick to clean , and very compact , it is very cheaply made after just 3 uses , one of the joints that adheres the top to the bottom broke had i not reacted quickly , i would have been burned we were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it
good idea bad product worked great 2 weeks magnets fell off end of week 2 probe quit week 3 costs more to return for repair than it is worth
this thermometer is very cheaply made it feels flimsy and the magnets on the back wo n't hold it secure on a metal surface
i honestly liked the blender a lot i received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen 's kitchenaid appliances range , refrigerator , dishwasher , pretty much everything other than the toaster oven at the time , there could be no better blender it looked great it promised professional performance it had kitchenaid 's brand and durability behind it
well , i ca n't say that i did n't like this thing at first it came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds at first it seems like a nice little unit i poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing i say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use \( filterless of course \) after a few uses , i noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly if you want your coffee now and have no time to pour , do n't get this item after having this machine for 3 weeks now , and using it constantly every morning , i have finally decided that it is near total crap i just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air water which caused the grinds blow all over the place spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter how nice if you 're going to buy a cheap coffee maker , spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi decent one toastmaster should stick to toasting if you do decided to get this , buy some towels and a mop as well
i should have listened to the other reviews !
liked the product when it was working
i should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer now i wish i had spent the extra 60 and gotten one from jiffy
i ordered this stupid thing one month ago and they delayed multiple times and kept saying delay these things will never come so never expect cheap things from amazon although they tried very hard to convince you to wait
for fifteen years i 've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one he bought it on sale at cosco last spring , then stored it until we moved back to the states from europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in nov i 've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk do n't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will not tighten any further i ca n't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position to scape or to add ingredients i like to make crepes , which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating it 's impossible with this machine i get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl , unmixed and the batter is full of lumps if i want to scape the bowl , \( which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk does n't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl \) i have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time , and even then , with the paddle or whisk attached , it 's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back you ca n't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely you have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand this takes a fair amount of force to maneuver it 's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter the speeds are not variable enough it seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out
rating should be 0 but that was n't a choice i ordered this item at beginning of july pending move to a place that did n't have a dishwasher they backordered it until august 10 so i waited and did n't have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets then , on august 9 , they sent me an email saying we ca n't get this item , we 're cancelling the order i have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher ! now i have to go find another online store to order from target may advertise the cheapest price but they don't deliver
this thing is a piece of junk ! it 's the only blender i 've ever seen that comes with a stir stick to unclog the sides of the jar \( where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades \) this should have been a clue that the thing was n't very well designed , and it was n't it always needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie , several times , which made the process a real pain also , the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty except for the jar it 's pretty cheap plastic but it 's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months good riddance
the brushed chrome is plastic the spout leaks , and the motor burned out in one week on top of that the store where i purchased it , kitchen kapers would n't let me return it saying it was n't designed for drinks that require crushing ice why then do some of the recipes in the manual call for ice cubes \?
i had received this set for my birthday from a friend when we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 quart pot was scratched on the interior this made the non stick aspect of the pot worthless i gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to amazon and had a new set sent out when we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot i thought i would contact calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say i called the calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long i gave up in retrospect i would spend the extra money and stay away from the non stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily if you get the calphalon one infused anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service remember the old saying you get what you pay for i do n't think these non stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use if you do choose to buy these pans examine them when you open the box for damage
after many years of buying and discarding inferior knife sharpeners i have finally found one that sharpens even my dullest knives
this is a poorly made product after a few months of use , the blade broke off the handle is hard , brittle plastic covered with soft plastic the blade extends into the brittle plastic only a little bit the results were inevitable pure junk
we have had the coffee maker about 2 months it makes good coffee but if you pour water too quickly into the left side of the reservoir you get air bubbles in the water level indicator told to pour on the right side
we had a krups for about 4 years at the office and the coffee was good we needed to replace it because the carafe broke and there was no replacement available \( they discontinued the model and the carafe thanks krups \) so , we replaced it with the fm4 i did n't like the coffee from the start but i figured it would get better two weeks later , i dumped it for a bunn b10 b which got good ratings here get the bunn it makes a good cup of coffee
my wife stopped me punishing any more innocent tomatoes when the oxo mandoline , my chopping board and the kitchen floor and walls were dripping with red 'stuff'
you have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel the advantage of that \? you can dishwasher stainless but you ca n't dishwasher nonstick ! you just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath
you are better rolling your windows down ! this thing does not work i have a sharper image one that is alot better this one is a generic imitation that does not clean the air crap ! ! ! ! !
indeed , there is a glass bottom , the walls are nonstick , there are even two nice handles the seal between the actual pan and the glass bottom leaks something terrible if you use it in a bain marie apart from that though , it 's fine
the spoon handle is crooked and there are marks damage to the wood avoid
i bought 2 sets expecting them to be as good as the other corning products i have used for over 30 years 1 piece cracked in half while cooking vegetable in the microwave and one piece cracked in half while baking chicken in the oven ! i wrote to the company and they have not responded
these are substandard thin towels they are cheap the current price is far too much to pay , and they should be about a buck each
after 5 washings , these towels still shed like a mother grrr
i bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter as soon as i saw the pan i was a little disappointed with the ridges they are deep \( which is good \) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos so your meats will be less brown
i got this with my food saver it cracked in just a few uses i'm not pleased with jardian either i was injured and ca n't talk when i tried to turn in a complaint by email they said i needed to get a friend or family member to call them on the phone in order to get help what ever happened to equal access for the handicapped \? maybe we handicapped should take our business elsewhere
i was not happy with this item at all the pillowcases are really thin and after washing and drying them , they are extremely wrinkled they also had pills on them after washing them before they were even used very unsatisfactory
read the one review , five stars , have no clue as to why it is a piece of junk first the handle closes on my fingers continously , next it barely heats , even on high , very poor steam the teflon soleplate is rough and drags on the fabric i wasted my money on a piece of trash from china hope this does someone some good bewar
i realize i'm in the minority here , but i do not find this can opener comfortable to use the crank does have a good grip , but i'm not trying to grip it , i'm trying to turn it i do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up , with my index finger on the far end pushing down the knob 's shape \( relatively short , fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends \) makes this cumbersome and tiring it does open cans cleanly most of the time , but if i'm opening a large can or several cans , i reach for my old basic swingaway \( which sells , incidentally , for less than half the price of this oxo \)
image is not the cover we received and needed color was correct the product seemed to be good quality very disappointed it was not what we thought it was still shopping for a cover to fit a board as shown
i received this saute pan for xmas i have other caphalon \( no stick \) pans and was delighted , based on claimed attributes of their top of line pan however , my pan did not have a flat bottom which is a problem on an electric range i returned to caphalon and hav'nt heard a thing i tired to claim lost but ups has proof of delivery i would like to get a known reliable brand i dislike poor products , am extremly disappointed with the service and total inconvience of the warranty program
i love oxo products for the most part but this product just is not well designed it does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use my husband and i have arthritis and i was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble the opening is way too big to accomplish that so , back it went to the supermarket i had hopes this oxo product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it does n't , i am rating this only one star
i have a dead knife this is a dangerous knife as i was cutting something the handle and knife broke i was only cutting cheese this should not happen with a good knife i loved it until it almost caused me major damage so be careful with this one
i am a man who loves his tea i drink up to a dozen cups a day , so i use my tea ball quite frequently my major complaint with most tea balls , and the reason i must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely over time this gets worse , and the tea ball becomes unusable there are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy
if you like scrapping food out of the bottom of a frying pan then this is the one to buy ! adding oil or cooking sprays did not help , even bacon slices stick to this pan ! i finally gave up and purchased a professional non stick frying pan and love it this pan is going in my next garage sale
i bought a machine similar to this one late last year it broke after about 30 cups the 'tap' for the steam jammed i'm still waiting for the repaired machine to be returned after 3 months yes months , not weeks according to delonghi service it will be another month before it 's repaired i have no faith this will happen , nor that it will work for any length of time after i receive it their service people , while reasonably pleasant , do n't help they know virtually nothing and seem reluctant to go beyond just answering your questions if you 're smart , you 'll go buy a coffee machine from someone else
i bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive i placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use , and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done i then checked amazon 's reviews , and found that this was a common experience they 're going back to the store tomorrow
it does n't break , chip , or even discolor , but the base has a compound kick \( depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside this makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside
i am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan i bought this pan last week i fried bacon it on medium heat \( as advised by salesperson \) bacon stuck fried eggs on medium heat eggs stuck ok , must be my fault try low heat i fried bacon on low heat bacon stuck fried eggs on low heat eggs stuck pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap \( as the instructions advise \) i promptly returned the pan and got a non stick my life is much better do not be fooled by the pan 's good looks think its just me \? my wife 's sister bought the same pan her report everything sticks my sister has the pan she hates it ! guess what \? everything sticks how can a product be so popular and perform so aweful \? you are hereby on notice
i 've had this for about 2 months and the handle snapped right off when it was working it was great , but for the price i expected to get more than 6 uses ! i'm very disappointed
this pan is a pure junk there are already a couple of reviews and the people recognize that this is not a non stick surface this is true to the very end , i mean everything sticks like hell
i used this seemingly incredible product and accidentally left it in the oven during a self cleaning it completely evaporated and left teflon covering the entire interior of the oven i had to replace the oven ! it was toxic from the teflon powder do not buy this product !
i was really excited to get the aluminum foil out of the bottom of my oven when i found this product , however , it did n't last very long
i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years mine as well as others used in stores stupid me , then , for not realizing that you get what you pay for my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years , but it served me well it is a machine of substance , solid parts , very stable trust me you do n't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam ! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh , and i'm returning it immediately the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep not deep enough to keep the pole stable the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended are n't firm any heavy jacket will make them slide the housing itself is amazingly lightweight i thought that was a good thing , but now i know why the jiffy steamer 's housing seems like it weighs a ton you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored handling a steamer is a serious matter do n't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive , poorly designed , lightweight steamer like the conair spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years jiffy you wo n't regret it and even though mine died after nine years , i have no regrets , and now i 'll do the right thing and get another
the design features for the on off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things otherwise , the on off switch is not good at all the button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position you actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going the blade was sharp for the one and only time i used it i took it back right after thanksgiving
i was given mr bento as a gift last summer i was so excited ! i bring a lunch to work every day , and i thought mr bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well organized , balanced , and easy to carry lunch you can imagine my dismay when the mr bento containers leaked day after day anything remotely soft came out from the containers , which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way cute \? yes impress your co workers \? yes but practical \? no
i have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off , causing it to continually leak unfortunately it appears that i have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion
this is the worst blender i 've ever used bought it to make smoothies , but it has a hard time grinding frozen things it never completely chops up frozen fruit , so i always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi mushy fruit when i try to blend with this thing not pleasant it 's also loud and it moves a lot sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base , and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base 's well i strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing
i have brewed coffee with and without the ridiculously expensive filters and cannot tell the difference if there was , i still would n't pay this much for plastic and charcoal what were the designers thinking \? \? \? it is just coffee , not fine wine !
after checking every store i could think of and accepting that i 'd have to go online , i laughed out loud when i saw this price ! what was mr coffee thinking \? i read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that i do n't even need them ! duh , i have filtered water in our house ! thank you mr train man the little carbon filter sounded like a good idea , but my coffee will survive without it at least it 's not a total loss because i like the coffee maker itself happy brewing
i am usually very pleased with oxo products , but this one is a big disappointment i have not found it to be good for or at anything wished i 'd saved the five bucks
i like the solid construction but i also like strong coffee this machine does not spray the entire filter basket instead , water dribbles out of a 2 inch diameter ring , leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle i sent the first one back the replacement does the same thing kitchenaid customer service confirms that , despite the discription on amazon , the unit does not spray the entire filter basket i'm sending the replacement back also if you love strong coffee , do n't buy this machine
i chose this set of knives because of the calphalon name \( i love my cookware ! \) , german steel use , and the description , hygienic fiberglass reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture , crack , split , or chip i was disappointed to find that one of the sets i ordered was already showing signs of rust even though the set was unused and delivered in a sealed box , all four handles had rust marks
i bought this set of knives 2 years ago i have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have , and i have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a lot of use the purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature i have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me mine gets stuck on lock and then i ca n't get it open without pulling on it with great force and when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives , that is a little uncomfortable to say the least i have worried more than once that the force i have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free they never have , but it is unnerving i tried to contact cuisinart about it , to no avail no complaints on the knives , and i love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set , which i have but do n't buy the product strictly for the locking feature , it is not worth it
this thermometer lasted about a month before going in to permanent hi mode what a ripoff
bought my first vornado years ago , and is the best fan i 've ever seen decided to get a second one purchased this model first unit had bad vibration , returned it second unit less vibration , but very noisy also returned when i compare this unit to my original vornado , the quality of construction is noticeably much inferior i do n't know if this applies to the rest of the vornado lineup or not
more money then its worth makes alot of noise , small , no oscillation
mine broke on the 3rd use ! no need to say anymore
worked great the first couple of times i did n't keep it on the charger for 24 hours \( not realizing that this is a problem \) and now the battery only works for 10 minutes at a time it 's now basically worthless
