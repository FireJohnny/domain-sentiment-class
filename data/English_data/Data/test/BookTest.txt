dale carnegie is one of the authors i have admired for so long there are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one he deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it of course , there are many negative people who do n't like this book because they see everything in black and white carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate , positive and humane approach to everyone around you it comes very close to treat the others as you want them to treat you i am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book , the world will be a better place i am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important his viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex after all genius things are usually simple carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples i liked that the book is practical , easy and fun to read , and most of all that it delivers great value i can not say the same for many other books definitely get a copy especially if you are a good person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity

barrow , an astronomer at the university of sussex when this book was published , provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics \? what 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have \? what accounts for what physicist eugene wigner has called , in a now famous paper , the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences \( 299 \) \? after an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers , barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism , inventionism , intuitionism , and platonism , a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor perhaps most mathematical workers follow what alfred korzybski called the 'christian science' school of mathematics , which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities \( science and sanity 748 \) i commend barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly barrow 's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations as for barrow 's conclusions , from a non aristotelian view , the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification , the confusion of orders of abstracting barrow does n't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics he seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him as korzybski pointed out , we live in a world of multi dimensional , ordered structures or relations it does not seem unreasonable , then , that we can map this world with an exact language of relations , i e , mathematics but as korzybski also pointed out many times , the map is not the territory quot
this is one of those life changing books i first came across this while looking midlessly through my local spiritual bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours
this book was mind expanding , and told a great story of exploring the facets of one 's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others my favorite part was the story of the golden pages where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man 's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery , but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm , if not war

suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in the mystery portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired i really did n't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin , who clearly stole the show in this book

as a prospective college student , i have to tell you how much i appreciate students' guide to colleges it combines many of the best features of the princeton review and fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness i also appreciate that it is without any trying to sound hip blather because these are not editor interjected profiles , they 're written by actual students this is a great compliment i have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year , and this is the best guide to colleges among the many i 've seen i also just read the oberlin college profile in this book with an oberlin alum and relative she said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate oberlin portrayal she 's read in a guide among other things , she and i loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable in previous guides questions like what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour \? the guide 's honesty also impressed me , as the fiske guide lauded vassar 's diversity , for example , where students' guide admits although vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot , most students are actually wealthy and white i am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from hampshire to harvard will find this book incredibly useful ! !

i am a lutheran church librarian and i am glad i bought this very satisfactory book for our church library its text stresses that children are the same the world over they have the same feelings and needs , and have the same hopes and dreams the illustrations are a nice change from the usual each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded the illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor , drawn in persian style the colors are very saturated the book 's cover gives you an idea of what they look like the message of this book is one of diversity that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities , races , ethnicities , languages or faiths , they still have the same hopes , dreams and daily needs this is a very important message for children to hear in today 's world where there is so much suspicion of those we perceive to be different the more children realize that kids are the same everywhere , the more tolerant they will be children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age , say researchers , so you have to nip it in the bud very early , and this book does that in a wonderful way

going into the business , i bought this book and found it very helpful this one as well as i'm living your dream life by michele cozzens are well worth the money
i originally bought this for my almost 2 year old because i wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown \( there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom \) instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters the reason this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging it is a beautiful book that provides i spy and where 's waldo type challenges i highly recommend this book for the 1 5 crowd

as a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text mechanism and theory in organic chemistry by lowry and richardson , this book by anslyn and dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student i agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging , the text is clearly written , and the material relates well back to current research issues if you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program , get this book before you try advanced organic chemistry structure and mechanisms by carey and sundberg i expect that modern physcial organic chemistry will become a staple to most chemist 's shelves similar to that of a crc handbook or advanced organic chemistry by march
line by line , this book has some of the best writing i 've seen in a while this is an amazing thing , since it 's still very fast moving and not at all overwritten the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor the book surprised me constantly with its insights , and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week i read craig 's first book , and it does n't stand up to this at all it 's exciting to see how much the writer has improved , and i ca n't wait for the next one
alistair maclean combines psychology , action , history , sociology , and intrigue into a wonderful spy story the hero potrtays a tried and true james bond without the condescending attitude there 's none better
i 've read , and re read the book , although not it 's full content , but randomly i open it and find a surprise each time i just love it
i 've gotten through about 1 3 of the book and i'm highly amused the first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far however , i 've laughed my way through them one thing eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor if you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that 's loaded with wit , i 'd suggest picking up this book i never knew there were four kinds of people before morons , fools , lunatics and cretins and i may just be a fool \)
this entry in the fang mulheisen series came as a surprise it was closer to something by elmore leonard or even carl hiaassen great , engaging characters , funny dialogue and an excellent plot
if you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics i started with once a month cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary , but , though i loved it was a hard days work then came jill bond and she was really talking bulk cooking ! when deborah 's first book came out i was excited because it fit in with my low on cash , short on time lifestyle
i had eyed this book for quite some time before i purchased it , and i am so glad i did ! the pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book ! most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based , so do n't pick this book up looking for lots of kid friendly drinks \( though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy , such as a s'mores hot chocolate \) the recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty , piping hot drinks
this is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution , how it will wither away , and what a society should look like \( or try to mould itself into \) after the revolution lenin , drawing on the works of marx and engels extensively , refutes many claims by both the anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state , and corrects many common errors believed about the marxist road to socialism this is a thoroughly informative read i recommend those wondering how a communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book it will open your eyes widely
this book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre it does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16 bar piece of a song for you ! great for auditions the book has selections from musicals \( old and new , familiar and rare \) , as well as movies \( even some disney ! \) there 's one for every vocal part granted , not every piece is exactly 16 bars some go a bit over , but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing it 's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out it 's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals
the big sky is not just a masterpiece , it 's probably the masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction this is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that is n't really dealt with that much the rocky mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 1850 the cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature , partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in cowboy movies mirror our own experiences in many ways the cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to americans , when actually nothing was further from the truth cowboys were regular working stiffs , about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day they did n't consider themselves free , nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day they did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage , and there was a bit of swagger to it people in town recognized cow hands for the tough as leather men they were , especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had but it was backbreaking work , and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years
this is a great compliment to the more project based make magazine , as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the makers of course , it also describes \( and shows , in beautiful photographs \) , their projects , but it 's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers , bored brainiacs , and fringe worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the diy geek culture creating incredible , real world projects , from the mega \( a home built submarine for 3 \) to the micro , \( a diy bat detector \) , to the whimsical \( a lego blocks project that will solve the rubik 's cube \)
a wild and crazy ride on a submarine stuck in the arctic ice this book is full of crazy characters ! both two legged and four legged a must read for anyone looking adventure in the high arctic
this one i read before i started leaving my reviews on amazon it 's a wonderful story you 'll love the characters absolutely a 5 star read

i thought this was an excellent book those who say this wo n't turn you into a champion overnight , i 've got news for you no book can do that only you can i 've raced \( retired now \) for most of my adult life including some pro races , some of my crew have gone onto champ cars , nascar , and f1 , i was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the champ car title and my engineer was from that team this book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career those who ca n't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they do n't need to buy any books , but most of us do n't have last names like andretti , senna , unser , etc if any of you have ever read senna 's book on driving you might also say it 's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to , not what he writes directly about few people will directly give you the secrets to motorsports
peter watson , holding a number of research degrees , offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book not being an easy read , it takes some time to get through

i absolutely loved this book ! i could relate to each of the four women at different times in their lives it reminded me to take all things to him in prayer at all times
it was a gift for my nephew and it delivered he just could n't put it down before he recognized all the characters
having worked with vbscript for a little over four years i am by no means an expert however , i feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting i was pretty skeptical when i saw the word advanced in the title , but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters
rather than reading a biography of red auerbach , wilt chamberlain and bill russell , turn to this period book ! here you get everything a complete portrayal of the situation of african american who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the brooklyn dodgers but at the same time it is an introduction to a time , when athletes were not the superstars of today

if one approaches this book with a view to learning music theory , one would be slightly disappointed the author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type all in all , i think this book will come in useful after i 've learned music and need to review theory from time to time great book though
i'm a fan of bill myers work and have been since blood of heaven this one slipped by me somehow and when i saw it i immediately got it while the plot is somewhat tight for the most part , i do have some problems with parts of it for one thing , the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him \( read the book to find out \) should n't have any qualms about killing millions of others so why is he so intent on the stones \? but the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old the minute anything happens , they 're all screaming each other 's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it for the first time emergency , we can live with it but when something happens every few chapters , you 've got to have a break ! daniel ! tyler ! helen ! tyler ! daniel ! dad ! helen ! tyler ! give me a break ! otherwise , a good story though not up to the same level as threshold or blood of heaven \( definitely better than eli though \) recommended

i admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in piece of my heart di stanley chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert his teenage daughter has facts to hide and di chadwick walks a fine line dci alan banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder
the third book of a series and follow the story line i have not finished it yet but am enjoying it
ed hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it does n't do justice to the man himself his dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them having shared some of his adventures but as a cop , i found that he loves cops if it was n't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one
v i lenin wrote this book in 1917 , while he was hiding from the russian government lenin pointed out that the question of the relation of the state to the social revolution , and of the social revolution to the state , like the question of revolution generally , was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the second international \( 1889 1914 \) he wanted to correct that oversight , and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book

this book is the best book on rand 's esthetics i 've ever read in fact , it is the only book on the topic that i know of it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by rand they approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory they demolish abstract art , and devote considerable energy to discussing rand 's definition of art they even propose their own individual alternatives ! if anything shows independence , it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work ! remarkable ! the world of rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship that is clear just by reading one of the reviews here , by people who are devotees of certain scholars who do nothing but repeat the catechism they take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published that is why they hate this book because it is independent minded judge for yourself do n't be fooled

good books on popular music are , frankly , few and far between this is one of those precious few journalist dan leroy has done a remarkable job of piecing together the details of the creation of this album even better , he has written an engaging story it might be a cliche , but i could n't put it down
this book shows you in an easy to read format the true capabilities of the dvd format and what is required to do it it helped me in being able to ask intelligent questions when purchasing equipment
what i like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it , and i bet he 'll take a look inside some books are so clinical others do n't provide enough information this one gets it right at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader as someone who has been writing for girls for years , i'm always curious about what is out there for boys , and i like daldry 's style
haccp is the acronym for hazard analysis of critical control points this text , by arduser and brown is the be all and end all on the topic in my view it even comes with a companion cd rom that contains all forms from the book in adobe acrobat \( pdf \) and ms word format this is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired
i love this little recipe book ! it is very simply written , but informative everything from what a crepe is and how to turn them , stack them , freeze them , and thaw them , to diagrams on folding crepes and blintzes , and , of course , the recipes the basic crepe recipe followed by all the variations , as well as dessert crepes and blintzes have n't tried very many yet , but am looking forward to it especially the orange dessert crepes
another incredible read from cj box i'm intrigued in the manner he sets up the future of joe pickett in each of his books i could n't put this one down
i studied the medieval islamic world a little in college , and fell in love it 's a fascinating age in which central asian buddhists , north african nomads , ethiopian slaves , greek cave dwellers , persian aristocrats , arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together , mixed , wrote wonderful literature , and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun but it 's hard to find anything written about the time that is n't arcane professor babble or islam 101 \( you know , there are five pillars of islam snore \)
with all the sensationalism and relentless obfuscation of the realities of life by the media i found this an exhillarating and thought provoking book there 's more , but i'm sure you 'll read and revisit this book again and again once it 's prominently displayed on your bookshelf worth every penny
pamela jaye smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters , which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth she has an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology , spirituality and metaphysics yet her real gift is being able to relate all of this amazing information in an entertaining and clear manner so that it 's easy to understand the book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures i highly recommend it
in this study demos examines family life as it was for the pilgrims who came over on the mayflower , before they joined with the massachusetts bay colony the book is in three main sections the physical setting \( housing , furnishings , and clothing \) the structure of the household \( family connections , including servants \) and individual development \( childhood , coming of age , and old age \) the most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the court although laws were not draconian , they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly mess up and you would be punished but it 's also true that people were not that different back then , either parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them families were at the core of society 's welfare even women were given rights denied them in the mother country it 's interesting that even these first settlers saw the american continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized , and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from plymouth itself , thus weakening communal ties a highly recommended book
this book is a big hit with my pre k class ! i was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while i was reading this they have memorized most of the book they all loved it ! an excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures ! i 'd definitely recommend reading this book to with ages four through maybe second grade

i really enjoyed this work didnt know this guy won a pulitzer but it figures i was swept away by the imagery created by this master it was evocative of cooper \( although he surpasses cooper \) , and mcmurtry and the guy who wrote all the pretty horses the master can always create the world to drown the reader in this guy is great i plan to read the whole series
in a hobby filled with opinions , this was a one stop shop for beginning to up and running of my first large aquarium it was exactly what i was looking for in a book of this nature i'm not going to say it 's the best , worst or in between because it 's the only one of this nature i bought
anna anderson anastasia
it 's been around two years since i first read this book , and i must say i reference it to people all the time the reason it is so darn fascinating i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data if i gave you an 8 track tape right now , would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it \? younger folks might not know what it is they would recognize tape \( maybe \) , but 100 years from now , how many players would be around \? the book talks about a project the author was on a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans \( or others \) in the future that the site is radioactive since the radiation could last 10 , 000 years , the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now what would the message be like \? if you read the book you 'll find out ! lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just could n't put the book down buy it , have fun

things are going swimmingly in fish ! land in the latest volume , fish ! tales , authors stephen c lundin , john christensen , harry paul and philip strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first fish book tales shows how four companies a long distance call center a hospital neural renal unit , a car dealership and a roofing company have applied fish ! theories effectively they also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the fish ! function the four main principles are familiar by now keep the work fun , seek to serve others , stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude but the examples in the book bring them alive along the way , the authors heavily sell their fish ! courses and merchandise that 's just good salesmanship but the real catch of the day is the final how to section , showing ways to apply these principles in any organization the lively writing style helps keep you hooked we suggest that if you have n't yet caught any fish ! , start with this one its cheery , accessible methods should lure you in , hook , line and sinker
while some may think that good work should be readable and enjoyable , great work is meant to elevate us stun us , amaze us , fill us with wonder otherwise , see spot run would be a masterpiece

michael hauge is not only a master at helping you elicit emotion from your story , he now also shows you how to do it in 60 seconds and generate nothing but excitement for your project
i really enjoyed this book i thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book there were some character changes and some additional characters in the book , but i do n't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there i read the book after seeing the movie i always wondered what the movie had been based on i love baseball , and i think the book was great
this novel is more enjoyable than the flanders panel , but still not up to the level of the fencing master or his recent series , the captain alatriste books the characters are well drawn , the setting comes alive , and the story flows there are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp , but i cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original the only real disappointment came when i finished the book i wish there was a follow up

people were looking for a book that could grab them about nam when this was a best seller in 1972 , and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in nam itself as a primary consideration portions of this book originally appeared in `the new yorker , ' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared frances fitzgerald 's original trip to vietnam was in february to november of 1966 , and resulted in articles for the `atlantic monthly , ' the `village voice , ' `vogue , ' etc people who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like nam , where large numbers of young americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion
this was the very first jonathan kellerman book i had ever read this is by far the best one he ever wrote i do n't think that i have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful it 's like watching a top notch horror mystery movie this has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone i still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now i give this book a 5 star rating
those interested in american art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book chicago and new york are the centers from which katharine kuh radiated as a museum curator , art dealer , and published critic , she was personally close to many of the modern masters in this book , she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives i especially liked the chapters on rothko , tobey and noguchi
if you 're an easily offended religious fanatic who 's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs i guess you should n't read this \( actually , you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels \)
i was so impressed with this book that i wrote the following letter to its author
i bought this for my classroom bookshelf i teach 7th grade science and my kids fight with each other to read it

i was at the sfmoma to see her yes exhibition , and exactly what i expected , i was overwhelmed with delight her art is whimsically amazing her music touches your heart and soul seeing all the people there that day , i was glad that yoko is finally getting all the respect she deserves , after all these years also caught her live performance at the los angeles 's roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away i truly think she 's one of the true visionaries of our time
i loved this book ! i picked it up on a whim at the airport , and could n't put it down for the entire flight now i'm telling all my friends to get it not only does it have tips about playing cards , but it 's just a flatout pageturning thriller you keep wondering where this guy 's life is going to lead him next very suspenseful and funny too highly recommended
this book brings together , pratical budget concerns with fashion , which are often in two totally different universes not worlds , universes in the fashionista there is everything from how to get wine out of a shirt to when to know if you should splurge on a coat in the worlds of increase american debt , this book should be on everyshelf in america ! it is light portable and she is extremely funny ! two thumbs up

first grade takes a test 8221 is an excellent , multicultural book that should be in every elementary classroom , especially kindergarten thru 3rd grades for it 8217 s use in demonstrating that the really important things in life aren 8217 t measurable , and even as a tool for helping students understand and interpret poorly worded questions \( and there will always be a handful of them on any standardized test \) , the book is invaluable highly recommended from this early childhood teacher
if i were to choose the two best novels by this author , they would be the nautical chart and the queen of the south the fencing master , by comparison , is n't as lively or as intellectually thrilling but it is a chewy read i particularly loved the characterization of don jaime as an older man realizing what he has lost in his life
most people are in awe of the classic however , a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts , rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition classics do not only thrill and teach , they also live
at 37 , john wade was lieutenant governor of minnesota at 40 , he ran for the u s senate he was heavily favored to win at 41 , he was n't just beaten in the primary , he was crushed loser by landslide
an absolutely magnificent peice of literature ! the use of language is witty and funny and i have never experienced such joy from a collection of short stories before the ''is he deep \? '' introduction set the mood of the bok and that question played on mind throughout the entire read fantasti
robert barid 's exploration of history 's secret connections is brilliant by integrating hidden and not presented in any other book various facts of sciences , he clearly shows that our ancestors had much deeper understanding of the reality than most of the modern people i had a chance to explore many other books by this author available from his page on the world mysteries com and i highly recommend all of them
the gospel of judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame it is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the christian faith like its many predecessors , it gave national geographic and anti christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of jesus a book titled the gospel of judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly , shot straight back down still , while its popularity was short lived , it allowed bart ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of christ surely ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered , \( the gospel of judas \) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century it rivals the finding of the dead sea scrolls or the gnostic gospels of nag hammadi
peter robinson is one of my favorite authors when i travel on vacation i make sure to take his latest novel piece of my heart transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago the characters were well developed and the story line moved there were many layers of sub plots that were interwoven i thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion
de mystifying a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians , educators , and musicians , and has been overdone unlike them , but not unlike a master performer , palmer is able to strike a balance between technique , feeling , and authenticity he is historically and musically adept without denying the blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance

the plot is stronger than dick and jane , not quite at the dr seuss level but my 4 year old loves the thing he wants to read it what more can one ask for a first reader than self motivation \? good illustrations , basic vocabulary , frequent repetition , and not scary
this is probably the single best work i 've ever seen on the science of packing joe back lived and worked in n w wyoming , and was a legend in the area his humorous annecdotes , and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams , combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject , make this a must have for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules , and survive this little work deserves a place in any packer 's library
some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book although in fact it is not an easily readable book , for the general public , if you have a serious interest about the history of the third reich , make no mistake you will not be able to overlook this book , which will surely be a classic it is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism the interaction between the new domestic and international values , based on aggression and the other causes involved in the rise \( and fall \) of the iii reich from a different perspective from other mainstream historians , this winner of the samuel johnson prize for non fiction , has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat , one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history no wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus a new history particularly well deserved of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law , a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian fuhrerprinzip
dark nature cuts to the very core of the will to survive mr watson takes you on an easy to read journey up the food chain to the homo sapiens who is neither man nor kind for me , dark nature removed judgment from the word evil , giving a deeper , behind the scene look at what drives life a must read this copy was purchased a gift in my judgment to continue to grow i needed to understand this piece of myself and the world around me
as a professional bridal consultant , i keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings ms mcbride 's bridal flowers is one of my favorites it is full of wonderful ideas not just the traditional must have wedding flowers such as bouquets boutonnieres , but the out of the ordinary \( but inspiring \) boas , decorated lampposts gilded calla lilies ms mcbride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn the large color photos are fantastic so many other books have little or no photos , or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering ms mcbride 's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about it does n't claim to be a how to book , but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer
this rare book details aleister crowley 's ascension as the prophet of a new aeon , the aeon of horus out of all the aleister crowley books in mass market format , this stood out in memory years after i read it as one of crowley 's most disturbing works in fact , i questioned my new faith in crowley 's religion thelema reading this book this was for real and not a joke after contemplating , i thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today 's youth and crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today this is serious stuff , i would n't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult it should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work i did a ritual from necronomicon and lesser key of solomon to help with a college astronomy course i got a respectable c grade when i close to failing with a d but be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism
this is a wonderful book , which my children adore , and which taught them each to recognize the instruments in the orchestra before they were three
the patterns in this book are really interesting they range from everything to cabled belts to baby booties to light sweaters this is n't as informative as the original stitch 'n bitch book , but if you have mastered the basics , it is a good starting point for ideas plus , it has tried and true tips and tricks from knitters accross the nation
twain 's account of his years on the mississippi is part travel book , part memoir , and part historical work , with a few sketches , stories , and tall tales tossed in for good measure there is even an outtake from the not yet published huckleberry finn , along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors this smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book , but much of it shows mark twain at his humorous and humanistic best
i like the way it teaches fractions and does n't use candy
this is a terrific book for young and older children it is a fun way to demonstrate why we need a universal form of measurement
i love this book ! ! i 've owned it for about a year now , but just got it back after a very long visit to my mother in law \( 3 months \) she loved the book also and did n't want to give it back ! she bought one of her own ! thank goodness ! i think she got tired of reading the recipes over the phone to me ! lol ! anyways great book , lots of information also great for what ever size machine you have does small \( 1lb \) , med \( 1 1 2lbs \) and large \( 2lbs \) for each recipe
how this book flew under the nation 's radar i 'll ever know furthermore it 's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized
on the way to a conference in new orleans , my flight from raleigh to charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems , and i was booked on a flight to d c as i boarded the plane with the carolina way under my arm , a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how i was enjoying the book i explained that i had not yet started the book , so i could not give an answer the gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as dr gerald bell , the co author of the carolina way myself a carolina fan , i was pleased to meet dr bell , as he spent several minutes talking about coach smith , whom i have admired for over forty years , and the unc basketball program , which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under coach roy williams dr bell 's contributions to the book tie coach smith 's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from carolina 's storied history to today 's business situations surely , coach smith , given his ability to recruit top players , has been criticized by many for his failure to win ncaa championships in the manner of coach john wooden at ucla , but winning two ncaa championships , winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict ncaa rules , and coaching top players that graduated at a 90 rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of coach smith 's system teamwork , integrity , loyalty , and hard work , are the cornerstones of the carolina way , and anyone in the position of managing , leading , or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book , corny as it is at times this book is not just for carolina basketball fans
this is my favorite jonathan kellerman novel the book focuses on a disturbing story about munchausen 's disease by proxy this book so quickly caught my interest , that i ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease i had not heard of this disorder when i read the book it was disturbing , intense , and tore away at your heart i would definitely recommend this book ! munchausen 's disease seems to have become a more popular topic since i read this book i have seen countless documentaries on , and it was also featured in the newest episode of house it is a disturbing , yet intriguing disease , and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it , munchausen 's disease by proxy
the story of illidan , malfurion , rhonin , and krasus using dark powers , heroic strength is enough to blow anyone away iy enchants me , it shows the world of warcraft from a combination of knaak 's and blizzard entertainment 's imagination
my three year old loves this and i do too ! it is a great book to share at xmas as well the pictures are wonderful and we are giving it to nursery school as part of chinese new year celebration
as an overweight , stressed out , 40 something professional , i am thrilled to find this book ! the spark is exactly what i needed to get my body moving again i am one of those who had fallen for the 1 hour a day exercise trap , and if i did n't have an hour , which i usually do n't , i just did n't exercise i love doing my three to four sparks a day , knowing i am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when i can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout this is a wonderful concept , and so doable ! it 's working ! ! thank you
always think twice never jump to hasty conclusions without considering all the effects of an act or decision that 's the essence of economics looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy
i found this in the church library , but it is not christian fiction it is simply an easy read the story is sweet , made even sweeter by the topic cake i am not even much of a cake person i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies cookies , etc but , as i read , i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator i do n't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet the need for sweets will be simply overpowering
overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a do the mix of recipes is fine , but they just seemed to be missing something they were all more or less of the huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done variety all of the recipes look tasty , though i would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes , especially some more creative ones let 's be honest , when you pay for a book you 'd like to see more than put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated dutch oven , salt and pepper to taste , cook until done quot give me a little something to work with here ! inspire me ! i can already cook a roast like this in the oven having said all of that , i would still reccommend this book the vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and i ca n't wait to try some of them as an aside , this is the only dutch oven book i 've seen with heart healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare given that the average do book requires the use of a metric ton of lard , this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks
both of my boys love this book and request it over and over again it is such a fun book to read because the children interact with the reader by answering the questions love it !
the shaman 's apprentice presents more information about the relationship between people and nature than many much larger volumes the story of kamanya , gabriela , and the shaman nahtahlah , educates children about the important roles of all living things the text is supported by rich and colorful illustrations which easily maintains the interest of children from four to 14 if you want the children in your life to understand the importance of rain forests and the need to preserve them , you must have this book
john gunther 's inside u s a comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get , hurling us back to the america of 1947 , as he explores , state by state , the people , politics , issues , passions and fads that make up our country written with great energy and insight , gunther captures an america justly proud of its wwii success , still unsure of its role in the world , and populated by fascinating characters like mayor laguardia of new york , governor saltonstall of massachusetts and boss hague of jersey city gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today he captures aspects of america that are gone , l never to return \( an industrial nation based on coal , iron ore and steel \) and he foresees issues that dog america to this day the negro problem \( actually , the white problem quot \) he condemns the segregationist society he finds in america , so inconsistent with its lofty ideals as you can tell , i loved this book it 's very hefty but every time you are about to put it down , gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading all this said , gunther does concentrate on the \( a \) historical , \( b \) political and \( c \) economic side of things you wo n't find much here about the arts or science but it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly
this is the sixth and final addition to the author 's excellent holiday time series , just in time for rosh hashanah ! as in the other titles , \( it 's challah time ! it 's seder time ! etc \) tod cohen 's full color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes , making jewish new year 's cards for their families , tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits , and blowing the shofar the sounds of the shofar are explained in easy , understandable terms for this young age level the children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names the brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre schoolers , their parents , and in the classroom included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about rosh hashanah recommended for all jewish libraries ages 4 6 reviewed by andrea davidso
pretty much all of the todd parr books we 've read are great but the peace book and the family book are by far our favorites they are very positive and carry a theme of tolerance we 'd highly recommend this book !
i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 , then it was a mere idea from that time on , until august 20th 2002 , i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover , patriot that he is , but also a flag i loved it , could n't be more happy
time was when the words betty crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks , although the books' recipes , for better or for worse , were always a product of their times the very first betty crocker picture cook book was published in 1950 \( still available \) , revolutionized how cookbooks were produced , and was an enormous best seller the recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company 's kitchens and in homes across america this was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages this gradually changed as betty and her books became more and more of a shill for general mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company 's bottom line , but to the detriment of good cooking
the cover of this book declares that you 'll learn ten simple truths that lead to an amazing life if your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to eat , drink , and be merry , then perhaps you 'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book alfred e neuman , of mad magazine , with his declaration of what , me \? worry \? provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by ms laroche if you 're looking for some deeper meaning to life , to success , to accomplishment , you 'd be much better served by reading napoleon hill , anthony robbins , dr covey , denis waitley , or brian tracey
most of the information is very theoritical and limited author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her in a nutshell , the message is that a dysfunctional mother 'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter \( s \) , and in turn , the daughter \( s \) may pass that onto her offspring \( s \)
on the one hand , i loved the book , since i am a big fan of thomas paine however , my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of the age of reason when they get the printing and or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books , they should remove this review at that point , i will eagerly buy a new copy
i was not a huge fan of the first book , but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book this may not be the case here while it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first , it is has it 's moments of unbeleiveablity how can dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him , and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him \? the only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister , and i kind of think it might be only a matter of time i also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission are they going to introduce a new character to be on to him every book \? this is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages
i am agreeing to the comment of e for effort on this book
i look for books all the time on this topic to see if there any new moves i can pick up to help shape and tone the stomach area which is a problem for most of us i think if you are just starting out this book will help you understand the positions you need to get into but it 's going to take alot more than 8 minutes to get results and i have been training for years
there is no doubt in my mind that josh harris is a good person , who sincerely wants to help people , particularly young christian women , who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene however , he does n't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular either he 's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant inexcusable in either case , considering how influential this book has become
in addition to the errors listed by others , i see missing letters in the middle of words , quote marks that are the wrong style \( backticks instead of curly quotes , done inconsistently \) , inconsistent indentations it 's a typesetting nightmare big disappointment
i found this book embarrassing to read not because it 's risque , but because it so clearly illustrates how the french italians got their reputations as great lovers is this the best that english literature can give us \? this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality
this bool from the evil russian is useless if you already own
lets say you were reading a book on the mafia , written by john gotti , or perhaps some lesser known mobster and there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and it 's activities furthermore , anyone who opposed the mafia and it 's activities was labeled an extremist and in the text , their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like ku klux klan , racist , bigoted , or paranoid , you 'd begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased , would n't you \?
the most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content , but , based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers , that most people actually believe this drivel how can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill informed \? the answer is that we cannot i will not bother to go through a detailed criticism , not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it , but because , in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in , no one would believe it today , the truth depends much more on one 's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence
the cover claims that the book has been revised and updated for the digital age , but winston 's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated the term , pda , does not even appear in the index
i approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions i did my best to like it , to find some secret meaning , some redeeming quality within , to no avail actually finishing the book was an accomplishment , in my opinion ultimately i found the book aimless , soulless , and the promoter of everything negative about the human species i know this sounds harsh , but time after time i felt let down by on the road
i was disapointed when i downloaded it and got 8 pages
this guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories
i devoured all of this writer 's books when i first discovered them and it had been quite some time since then when i bought this book i'm a real sucker for a book with dogs so i dove right in only to become disappointed all too quickly i did n't remember all the rambling it is rampant ! at times it was almost like reading a text book for all the 'skimming' that i did i ca n't say it was a waste of time but some more editing would be appreciated
i am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here simply put , this is the single worst novel i have ever read everything about it the writing , the characters , the story is godawful here follows an absolutely true story while i was forcing myself to read this drivel , i went out on date she and i were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it i was advocating the 25 page litmus , and she insisted on at least fifty she did several long train commutes a week to and from work , and so read a lot of novels anyway , i started describing this book she recognized it immediately , and interrupted me saying , the bear went over the mountain ! do n't read another word ! if you think it 's bad now , it only gets worse , if you can believe it ! quot she was right if you feel the need to find out for yourself , save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library
joseph nye keeps repeating himself multilateralism by global american charm attack that is simply a stupid assumption and it is untrue of american history in foreign relations nye still owes some answers to european scholars of international relations who criticized his idea in fact that is no personal multilateral approach
i found the book thought provoking , but there is more to philosophy than provocation the common underlying argument of this book , and its only valid statement as ethics , is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior , the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in this results oriented approach is all very well , but singer does n't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument virtually all of singer 's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept if you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument if you do n't accept the premise , its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion in short , these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline how useful you find this is up to you i personally do n't know singer from adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before i picked up the book as a result , i have trouble seeing what people are so excited about
this book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 2006 most of which are inacurate his boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions \( dow over 40 , 000 \) presented in this book
i originally wrote a review of this book in 1999 , titled this is a racist book disguised as a work of art it seems that i did n't explain well enough my objection to styron 's co opting of the story of a real human being , nat turner , whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book , the confessions of nat turner , by t r gray not only did styron steal the title of gray 's book , in which gray recounts his interview with the real nat turner , but the incidents styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern bred racism
i really love amanda quick , but this one just did n't work we do n't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together the action starts after they 've already spent a week getting to know each other very disappointing from a romance novel
the notion of interpretive communities is at best derivative of kuhn 's classical work , the structure of scientific revolutions , and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony
like others , i picked this book up after reading several in the no 1 ladies series no comparison
this novel of a 17th century samurai 's odyssey to europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way , but towards the end , endo does get in a few good points the style is somewhat pedantic and staid , but easy to read it 's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces the historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut and pastes from history textbooks i must admit i am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here i can only conclude that a lot of people who do n't really have much experience of japan , think they 've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly westernized piece of writing by a japanesese christian remember , not every japanese woman is a geisha , and not every japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai 's sword
it took me a year to finally complete this book and honestly , the only reason i completed it was because i had nothing else on my bookshelf to read this book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end what a waste of such a beautiful book cover do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money
the book had so much promise , but i find it to be disappointing in several ways , alas the recipes i 've tried have been delicious , and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative , although the discussions and instructions do n't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool , as would , for example , anything by julia child , marcella hazan , jacques pepin , or any of the king arthur flour baking cookbooks , all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes in this case , i was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before i bought the book were i a tyro , i do n't think this book would be the best introduction , although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying
this is like teen love fiction , and by that i mean it 's like a teenager wrote it , one who uses bad detail , cliche phrases , overused idioms , bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot
do n't buy this book if you do not have to for a class i did as with most textbooks , it is a ripoff mankiw got a 1 4 million million dollar advance for it who do you think pays that
you think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond , but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead i love konstatinos' other books , but this one left a bad taste in my mouth
dr freeman 's justly esteemed lee 's lieutenants a three volume work still stands \( despite the discovery of materials unavailable to dr freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s \) as the baseline for any study of the army of northern virginia the cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise , offered here , throws out two of every three words dr freeman wrote to allow for a one volume abridgement for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books
this is probably one of the hardest books i have ever read with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics , much of what hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible i also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being post human quot if you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition , with links to literature , read this if you do n't really care about the post human , skip it
i have to agree with stephen haines this guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink he makes boehme a gnostic , the troubadors , the knights templar , william blake , the masons , jung , and finally , any physicist worth his salt
this book deserves no stars
i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver , i knew the rest of the story it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing the story 's decent the text flows nicely , and the suspension of disbelief is strong , but where did nick 's originality go \? where 's the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook , a walk to remember , and nights in rodanthe \? it seems like he 's run out of steam , or did n't care too much about this one
i'm a long time fan of the anna pigeon mysteries , and have read all the others unfortunately , hard truth does not live up to the quality of ms barr 's earlier works it feels very contrived it also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups this book just does not meet the expectations i 've come to expect from the series
i 've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before , and have always been very pleased , but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth lp was the only guide we purchased , based on our previous experiences with them , but we had the chance to peruse others in the b b 's we stayed in throughout our trip of all of them , i 'd rate the lp as the 2nd best for our interests as they say , individual experiences may vary ! ireland has become a very expen ive tourist destination , so upon reflection , we would have been happier with the rough guide lp has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up short changing all of them in the process i hate to say it , but i 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best i 'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though
this is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message it should have been tiltled the jewish mother tree or something so the message was use me and use me and use me some more and after i'm all used up , use me some more and i will be happy thats something we want to convey to children
much of this book is very one sided in particular the sections on the environment are distorted and now known to be incorrect the book would be much better if they had not shown their bias
ayelet waldman is a graduate of harvard law school , so i assume she 's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer she should stick to what she knows the fact that she 's married to a famous author does n't make her a writer her novel is poorly written , overly sentimental and , to put it bluntly , very dumb
i had read a book about the french and indian war , one about the revolution and also the recent best seller , 1776 i found the war that forged a nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in american history i would highly recommend it very readable
there is n't much i can add to previous reviews of civilziation and its discontents my own reaction \( after 2 cracks at it , one in college , and one post \) is one of bafflement and boredom with academic , convoluted language , freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers rousseau , for example his psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works therefore , the redeeming value is found , perhaps , in freud 's closing passages , eery portends of europe 's ugly years
unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone very dull indeed but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it 's story time and she 's a preschool teacher
if you look at the march 2004 issue of the international association of bloodstain pattern analysts , you 'll find a very negative review of this book given that the reviewer \( herbert leon macdonell , the director of laboratory of forensic science bloodstain institute of corning , new york \) and all members of iabpa actively work in the field of forensics , i 'd take their word for it here 's an excerpt from the review , which can be found on the web at http www iabpa org march2004news pdf
first , i am a very open minded person , raised by a hippy biker family i really expected to identify with this book while i appreciate the what ina may 's movement accomplished during its time , i felt like the book was almost a joke verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community a community of people living on old school buses in the woods , delivering each other 's babies
i am soooo tired of danielle steel 's books they have lost all of the originality with which she used to write every book now has the same story line just different names for the characters boring ! what happened to the good stuff thurston house , ghost , kaliedescope
there is no measure how harmful and disastrous this sermon has been to all who have read or heard it the teaching of hell or everlasting damnation \( eternal torment \) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of christianity over 1800 years ago the first century church never believed in a hell the theory of hell was brought in by converts to christianity from pagan religions of the world hell was embraced by the political religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and converting effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as orthodox centuries after the resurrection of christ our english translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact , when it is actually fiction mostly all english versions except the concordant literal new testament and young 's literal propagate this fallacy
sometimes i 've enjoyed books by david baldacci \( wish you well
this book belongs in the fantasy section of the library
never received the book , so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost i have incurred
the most disappointing thing about the news from paraguay is the beginning , and not precisely because is a bad one , but because in the first chapters of lily tuck national prize awarded novel , there 's a hint that could have been better than it turn out to be
this is one of the few books so bad that i could n't finish it there is no explanation of how things work , or in many cases what they really are i feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed , sex , or guilt about greed and sex do not bother with this book
throughout my read , my head kept shaking with disappointment if the renaissance of hard sf relies on stories a full decade , even two decades , old , then the genre 's future is feebly fixated on its past not to say that some of the stories here are n't wonderful emphasis on some quot but dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard sf fails to deliver on the title 's promise this is more nostalgia than renewal , and you should read a library borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past passing but do n't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into sci fi 's future
the book is written about an empire in the future i'm not really sure why asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer , which is a dying system of government , instead of a democratic republic i know this is nit picking , but i did n't like this book
my name is big samad sefiane , i have been writing screenplays and making music since the age of 13 the only problem with that
while this book put together by the detroit free press has action photos , they are some of the most disappointing pictures i 've ever seen in a book about a team 's season where are the photos of tiger players actually hitting a baseball \? if you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne , talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles , then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself , be prepared to be frustrated i much preferred the photograhy in the george cantor paperback out of nowhere the detroit tigers' magical 2006 season i know that this volume covers the play offs and world series whereas the cantor book does n't , but it 's photo collection is poor , the photos in the cantor book are superb if you are a tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much , \( the writing and articles are quite good at least \) but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc very disappointing , worth only 2 stars
edward said , created a proble and made a career of the israel palestine conflict , and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the arab palestinians he was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry , linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti israel and anti jewish hatred on every university he spoke at hopefully , this vintage book will become no longer relevant , ans disappear
can anyone tell me if the book words on the vine has an answer key with it \? thanks sgra
the only thing this book is good for is getting high with your friends then reading the dialogue aloud the thought that anyone actually believes or takes the situations in this crap serious is so befuddling it 's scary this is nothing more than propaganda for some strange religious cult i do n't know about you but if i'm going to buy a book to help me with my kids it 's going to be by an expert , not some failed fiction writer
i 've read five of the nine temperance brennan mysteries that kathy reichs has published , but this is my least favorite i lost interest about two thirds through i felt the villains were not fleshed out , the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely , the ending too neatly contrived , and the personal romantic side story too awkward this one was also too long , by about 50 pages reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients , yet they did not blend into a successful flavor the other four of her novels were fine i love the tv series as well , although bones allegedly shows dr brennan much earlier in her career , with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books in the tv series , dr brennan has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly in the books , her lesser characters all seem lesser , indeed better luck next time out , dr reichs
first off , so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor , imagine a junior high school student acting big to impress his friends with jokes , that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book it is filler the illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low just more filler finally , all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of ps , or at worst a few internet searches i think this book is over priced and i wish i could return it caveat emptor
if tess is going to continue to write books like this , she should switch her publisher to harlequin romance , it will give the unsuspecting buyer a heads up
totally disappointing from the beginning the novel read well , but like a sherlock holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue i , personally , do not like reading this type of mystery i want clues alas , there were none also , the characters did not make sense most were too undeveloped mr patterson needs to go back to the drawing board try to forget the he is being paid up front by the publisher
i wish i could have back the numerous tedious hours slogging through white noise to the bitter , bitter end not since jane smiley 's moo has such a dull tome been written aobut , among other things , ameican academia little happens of note no one cares about the cardboard characters someone gets shot in the belly , for no good reason and yet this is fawnedover as a comic masterpiece by , among others , the new york times i ahve been told to read white noise before i picked up underworld have no fear i 'll undergo root canal without novocain before i try that one on for size i 've been reading nothing but plumber 's trade journals and german magazines just to try to get the taste of this novel out of my mouth for the past few days i'm thinking of getting the definitive curious george collection just so i do n't have to read any words at least that guy in the big yellow hat knew enough to keep his mouth shut , unlike that noncompoop jack gladney and his boring friends if people prersist in thinking this is great literature , i suggest giving up reading altogether
i did n't find the book too bad but it has no ending did he leave out the last chapter \? i have always liked his books so hopefully he 's got this out of his system
pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought he mistakes child abuse for some form of real child rearing i just read his interview in the guardian uk although it has been years since i have read this book , it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when i think about it i have read philosophy from classic to contemporary i have lived in japan and practiced zen archery and zen meditation this book has only incorrect views of western and eastern philosophy yet pirgsig , to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon this is proof that pirsig remains deranged moreover , in the guardian uk interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son 's murder pirsig is a perfect example of someone with narcisstic personality disorder pirsig 's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and or capitulating mother
the premise of the store is interesting how did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football \? the first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons \( west coast offense , lt , etc \)
i love linda howard books i always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least i think the characters are not developed well , and the relationship between cal and cate occurred too fast the story was rushed and i'm sure linda could have done much better writing on this book
this is a liberal 's study bible the study notes show the best 'modern' scholarship , which doubts moses wrote the first 5 books of the bible doubts the authorship of most of paul 's epistles even doubts that the beloved disciple john wrote the gospel of john
i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president \( ! \) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too
to say christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world purely craziness christianity will live as long as the world exists what is died is the faith for many christians , what has been changed is our faith \( by money , pride , and selfishness \) and consequently , our church and our societies
bill o'reilly has a good reason for his massive paranoia somewhere , deep in the recesses of his brain , he knows something 's wrong only he 's got it backwards the secular progressives are doing just fine , but he 's the one with the serious problem here 's a guy who had to pay millions of bucks to settle a sexual harassment suit yet , he 's proclaiming himself the arbiter of the correct , traditional point of view only in an era of the stupid , undereducated and witless would bill o'reilly have a modest role to play save your money
i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant heavy , top 5 bschool this text was recommended for my intro cap markets class \( although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class \)
very disappointing and boring ! no likeable characters , very uninteresting story could would not finish too many better books waiting
i have enjoyed the miss julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite
col mike martin raised in iraq , speaks fluent arabic
do n't make the mistake of judging the entire hard case crime series by this lackluster entry
pros 1 john corey is still a funny , memorable character
clarke 's glaring research error author of the prophet , kahlil gibran \( 1883 1931 \) , in an article titled the new frontier wrote are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what can you do for your country \? clarke sure missed this one , as have so many before him did kennedy just paraphrase , or did he plagarize \? i would have liked to have seen clarke deal with this sticky issue
i was so excited when i initially bought this book and honestly , when i read it i was disappointed i thought it was a bit dry and boring to read through , despite the useful tips although the authors try hard , they really do n't convey the spirit and fun that college life has to offer
while i found this book interesting and informative when it dwelled upon the personalities and contributions of the physicists who discovered and explored the field of quantum mechanics prior to ww2 , i found two problems with the book as it entered the war first , it spent too much time , at least for me , on the details of minor episodes and players in this sense , i might have appreciated the treatment had i been a scholar researching the field but i was n't hence , i often found the reading dull second , i found powers' ultimate thesis that heisenberg purposefully delayed the german atomic bomb program unpersuasive it appeared to me that powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis for example , when reviewing heisenberg 's farm hall statement in august 1945 that two tons of u235 was required to make an atomic bomb , powers suggests that because heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later , and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football , his two ton statement was a purposeful error equally persuasive , if not more , is the simple thought that heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required , thereby prompting him to tell speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical this is not to say that powers is necessarily wrong i simply believe that based on the facts he presents , the issue remains debatable
this is not what i expected or wanted the book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature the description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use
i know h james is considered one of the greats of american literature and i question my taste for hating most of his writing with few exceptions i think he is a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism i read wings of the dove many years ago in the days when i would not allow myself to set aside books i did not enjoy i recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why i disliked him so much now in my old age i had no pangs of conscience when i happily closed the book before finishing it if more of the stories had been like daisy miller i would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of wings i am currently seeking relief from henry 's turgid prose by reading hemingway i 'd trade in a henry for an ernie any day it 's also difficult to like mr james' snobbish , shallow and unsympathetic characters the more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style
earlier this year i reviewed what many will see as the companion volume to this book \( photoshop blending modes cookbook for digital photographers \) , written by the same author unfortunately , the newer publication is less useful it seems to have been written on a pretext that it 's clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do this seems from my own personal viewpoint to be greatly undervaluing the power of photoshop \( and similar software \) practitioners of digital fine art should \( really , constructively \) be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain
this book is not worth wasting your money on the techniques that are represented look ok to the untrained eye , but if you examine them closely , you will notice many mistakes the techniques are sparse , one per angle they are also demonstrated with poor posture and attack to the novice , this book may appear to represent the art of cabales serrada escrima , but it does not more than half of the book is unrelated to the system of serrada this book does nothing to show the effectiveness of cabales serrada escrima
the monographs lack any sort of scientific references a true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made
ultimately the ending was so outrageous that it took away from the rest of the story i would not recommend it to anyone for that reason i 've already given my copy away
i was more than willing to give none dare call it treason a chance , as i found the scale of stormer 's research impressive however , the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive communist takeover in america came to pass , coupled with his outspoken admiration for mccarthy and truly insane predictions like this
if the author 's misuse of the apostrophe in the title is any indication of how they wrote the rest of the book , i would stay away
i recently picked up a copy of mage the awakening not knowing quite what to expect since ars magica i 've loved mage from gurps i quickly switched over to white wolf 's editions of mage the ascension , finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today
white wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing they did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they 've ever been
i bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling look at the picture of the forever cool ms mathieson
this is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor the book traces the history of the knights templar and their supposed transformation into free masons much of the discussion focuses on free masonry , including its role in the american revolution i found the factual support lacking and the prose quite uninspired
krakauer is highly confused and i can tell that so are some of these reviewers he cannot give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself the church he is talking about is completley separate from the church of jesus christ of latter day saints jon krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that do n't believe that their assumptions were correct
coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project i would have to say that this book is kind of boring if your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book but if you 're going to read it just to read it , then i would suggest you not i have to admit , that some of the stuff richard feynman says is funny but i found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness do n't get me wrong , i really do admire mr feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok sometimes he got into a lot of in depth physics stuff that i just did n't care for but sometimes i was interested in what he was saying
elizabeth george , please come back this book examines in sickening detail the events preceding the murder of our lovely helen i , for one , do n't care i get it we all got it the last time it 's been a long time since i have abandoned any book after a few chapters , and this book truly deserves to be put down in every sense do n't buy it
i had read such glowing reviews of this book , and had enjoyed other creamer works so thoroughly that i was suprised how uninspired i was while reading this perhaps i failed to be dazzled by stengel the man perhaps i grew tired of the predictable retelling of stengel 's life , season by season , many of which held no remarkable events baseball in '41 is a much more rewarding book , full of wonderful anecdotes well recounted
i enjoyed the plot and the characters it was very funny but there were too many grammar mistakes in the book , which i found too irritating and distracted from the book some conversations did not flow logically one person would answer herself , which did n't make sense also , the author switches from 1st person to 3rd person with the character of nickel and she used 'to' instead of 'too ' as a former copy editor and english major , this was very distracting ! but overall , a great book i plan on getting the next 2
i did n't care for this book at all i think it is a very well written book , for teachers , but not for a parent who is transracially adopting a child i was looking for a book on how i would parent an african american child and this book was more of a textbook i think it is very misleading to have it labeled as a must read for parents and teachers and it should be advertised as a book for teachers i thought inside their voices was much more informative about the experiences of a transracially adopted child
why \? because i was expectin something else , but first of all , i did n't expect that you have to open make a hole in your robosapiens to modify it , so forget it ! i will not damage my robot
i was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book after that it seemed that little new information was added , or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition there were so many different characters , and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news the structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on tv
just bought a rotisserie and was hoping to find how to use it and good recipes only found about 4 or 5 i would 've liken to know different types of meat you could cook in it and for how long you cook it for
mailer tells us a lot we do n't want to know about it 's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer 's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier he gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he does n't know about all the negative aspects of his persona are laid out still , it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them or else he needed the money truth sells , even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book , and quite un useful it should have been titled me and my books , some thoughts on me and my writing
i 've read some of the other reviews , and i could n't disagree more this book is not a page turner i found myself skipping over whole sections of prose because they were boring and sometimes needless the story is straighforward hardly any surprises hardly any twists or turns bad guys are always bad guys good guys are always good guys there 's no hidden agenda lurking through the story the blue rose is a natural anomaly the people who really want it the people willing to steal and kill for it are conveniently identified as people willing to steal and kill for the blue rose there 's no mystery here really it 's just a matter of getting to the end of the book
after trying 2 recipes , i thought that i was a pretty bad cook so , i asked my friend , a very good cook , to try a couple more recipes she had the same results disgusting ! ! these recipes must not have been kitchen tested mine as well just boil some chicken and dump a can of cream of mushroom soup on top the results would be better stay away
i held great hopes for this book duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country however , secrest in her drive to capture the essence of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight to say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement but worse than that are the inaccuracies , especially when she writes about duveen 's customers just for starters , apparently she did n't recognize the need to differentiate between john d rockefeller , jr and his father \( or maybe she did n't know there has been more than one jdr ! \) you wo n't learn much from this tome that you do n't know to begin , and getting through it will be a struggle
the original julie and romeo was delightful this book was utter nonsense a great disapointment finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along it did n't
after some years in the ic design business \( mostly analog \) i needed to teach a course on asicss this book was the text specified by my predecessor i did not like the book , and eventually read the weste and harris book in its 3rd edition wolf is not nearly as clear , complete and logically organized as weste and harris no comparison
the book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again so you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea it seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas \( come on , man , if you have 10 pages of good ideas , give them to me in 10 \) but then again i guess most books in this genre make you do that sheesh
if your into hendrix enough to want to find out more about electric ladyland , your probably already going to know everything in this book if you 've read such great hendrix books such as 'electric gypsy' then you wo n't get much from this book other than information obtained that you 've read before from 'electric gypsy' coloured in this authors opinion on jimi 's music
this is by far one of the least helpful parenting books i have read i used numerous suggestions in this book and none of them proved to be effective using my own judgment and keeping calm with a positive attitude toward my toddler proved to be more effective then anything mentioned here his suggestions for head banging are completely stupid and made my toddler bang her head harder during a tantrum not recommended
the book starts out captivating then it suddenly shifts to elkinks views of painting , that are strongly bent to the favor of abstractionist elkinks thoughts on jackson pollocks creative energy is more than i wanted to know he devots almost an entire chapter to this already to small book , to his idol how pollock flicks his wrist to get the effect of splated paint just right and pollocks tourched stance over his works as the canvis is lying on the floor to much ! i do not recommend this little book
this book is bad for beginner and practically useless for a master there is no comprehensive description of training complexes , footwork drills and other important details , which were completely omitted it gives just an overview of the system in general , so the reader can have some vague feeling of what giron escrima is
i bought this book thinking that i would learn something new about the cosmetic industry not only did i not learn anything , i came away from the book wondering just how someone could 've accumulated all of that information without being able to present it in a better way
it is now more than a month after i was supposed to receive this book and i have not gotten it yet , what the hell is going on
2 stars for decent writing \( at least a decent translation \) , for an intriguing start , and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf that 's pretty much it negative stars aplenty for the protagonists coy and tanger \( i listened to nc on 13 endless tapes , so perhaps am misspelling their names \) the tortured metaphors they speak , think , and by which they and their insipid adventures are continually described , bore to tears aside from an occasional scrape between coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss , all of the action in nc clusters at the beginning \( promisingly so , i 'll grant \) and the end \( all wimper , no bang \) of this novel as a salty seadog once said \( no doubt anticipating this novel \) , ahoy matey , thar she blows !
the nautical chart could have been a better book if , its author had eliminated about 50 to 100 pages the story dragged i read it at night in bed and i kept falling asleep the book does have its merits the information regarding navigational instruments and history was interesting and was exciting at times the ending was good \( the best part of the book \) the relationship between the coy and tanger had shades of james caine and jim thompson even so , i would hestitate about recommending this novel
south by java head features fundamentals i find so promising a nautical adventure set in southeast asia during world war ii , written by a prominent screenwriter nonetheless , the story falls flat and i found it just barely compelling enough to finish the plot moves slowly , punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another , the descriptions of action are confusing , and the characters mere outlines devoid of development i hoped this book would be as good as a 1950 's nautical adventure i highly recommend , the wreck of the mary deare , but unfortunately java head is just disappointment for other se asia world war ii fiction , clavell 's king rat is also a good place to start
i read this book and hated it i was sorry i wasted my money normally , i would have donated the book ater reading it but , in this case i was so disappointed , i threw the book away after reading it i was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the us i was also disapponted in the oprah book club selection committee it seemed to me they found a story they liked , and that is where their critical thinking ended it was the only and last oprah book selection i ever bought after reading it , it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the oprah club had never been to western pa i am from western pa as is o'dell and this book lacks local color she either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale landscape is just not about dysfunctional families , eatnparks and religious statues in the yards people in that area of pa say ai n't , slippy , and youns this would be esp true for someone like the main character , harley \( there are people with college degrees from this area who still have color in their language \) o 'dell is no faulkner or caufield i find this lack of local flavor with a lot of modern authors unfortunately , our books are even becoming mcdonaldized there is nothing special about this book
although interesting , these are designs and concepts that are not practical in the real world but , if all you want are some pretty pictures
this book is not my favourite in the heartland series it is not even really about heartland , the main part of the book is based in occanumba
replicant alert ! avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie except for the last couple of pages , the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about post modernism you will be much better off buying the director 's cut on dvd , and watching it several times ! this series of books has its exceptions , this is not one of them unintentionally hilarious in parts , as only the academician can be pretentious , ponderous cinema scholar jargon that offers little of value or insight read sammon 's the making of blade runner instead ! \( nice cover , though
the message meant more to me than to my young children they didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box they think playing in cardboard boxes is fun , not a punishment for exercising too much freedom i could see using the book as a basis for discussion , but i think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents
the book was specific to one particular model of blackberry they should have that in the title it was of no use to me after five minutes , i set it aside to gather dust
i got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how coach k motivates his teams , organizes his practice sessions , and instills leadership qualities in his athletes what i got was a less than thrilling re hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter you 'd have to be a true blue devil fan to like this book i did n't , so i gave it to one of my co workers who graduated from duke he likes it
leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth \( e g he never actually studied hwa rang do he offered the lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history \) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book i 've ever seen try marinas' panandata , mark wiley , the presas brothers , leo giron or ray galang for stick stuff you 'll be much better off
i really expected more from coetzee , whom i had never read before picking up this book i saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes , and i'm not surprised the title character spends all of her time giving speeches , which is strange for a novel you think you will get a plot , but you just get lectured to the writing is good , spare and cogent , but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel , in my opinion the best chapter , which is the last , has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters
not the most exciting book out there but if you like minor league baseball , this book 's worth a quick read
i was disappointed greatly at the time i opened this book huge gaps between strings , lots of empty space on pages all this is for masking the simple fact this 200 pages book contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less and , more , these pages are filled with useless interviews \( who wants to read an interview instead of explanations \? ! \) and other empty words
i was not expecting this book to be a sunday afternoon photo shoot for reanactors it lacks reality and substance i returned this book out of disapointment seeing the same faces in every picture but in diffrent uniforms takes a lot away from this book however , the color photos were nice better luck next time but a a for effort
i'm a pretty diverse reader , so i decided to give this one a go it started out somewhat interesting , but then just sort of made me keep saying , okay what 's the point here \? i really like ninah , the main character , but i keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in i guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this , but i closed the book wondering , why did i read this \? i grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the punishments just ridiculous i'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions , but this was just way out there for me ninah 's relationship with her nanna was the neatest one in the book i'm glad i'm finished now i can move on to something more fulfilling
i am a long time admirer of claire mcnab 's writing despite the fact i have been disappointed in the direction \( or lack of it \) in which she has taken the carol ashton mystery series although she is more known in the u s for her mystery and espionage books , her novel under the southern cross is a bang up , great romance delivered in her typically spare \( or is it stingy \? \) style i was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a 10 second sex scene thrown in but , when i got to the last line of this book i found myself closing it and thinking that i had once again been suckered by past memories of claire mcnab
having a plant nursery for 20 years i can tell you if this book is you only resource be in for a wild ride he states many places what has cause him the most problems , but no one starts a nursey the same and workable ideas would be better than the work he calls stressful and more important than growing plants our nursery is the opposite of stressful and has so many happy rewards never mention in this book very little help on selling and getting customers also
i was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book after that it seemed that little new information was added , or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition there were so many different characters , and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news the structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on tv
i'm a huge suz fan but i really think she missed the boat on this one her style has changed since she moved to hardcover this book just fell flat for me the secondary storyline or fbi agent jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple cosmo jane did n't like her at all cosmo lost his seal ness somewhere along the way not a re read for me
this book is simply an ego boost for the author i found absolutely nothing i could use in my own business , but was
a book on the theme of having the courage to deepen family ties that 's a good theme however , the author ca n't leave well enough alone he really goes after people without kids as though they all , regardless of their circumstances , remind him of his former self someone with too much cynicism and cowardice to raise a family even though that 's obviously the only way to become a complete person
i bought this book because \( if i recall correctly \) it was long listed for last years manbooker prize and also , \( this i recall \) because it had good reviews here on amazon anyway , i was real disappointed i quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later i found the contrasting aspects of the father 's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality character of aunt , cousin , priest , mom etc etc also grew gratingly perfect this may be excessive , but after a while i felt like i was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel the comparisons with god of small things are seriously unflattering to roy 's great book comparisons with \( the overrated \) memoirs of a geisha or \( also not finished \) one thousand chestnut trees would have been more appropriate
this book deals with some fairly rediculous topics i'm not into mysticism or talisman 's or that stuff , so perhaps i am biased
why someone would chose these books is beyond me , especially when there are so many other good choices literature has an impact on people and the only impact i can imagine junie having on others is negative
i agree with some of the negative reviews that the junie b jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable my son , who is a pretty sensitive boy , did n't like junie b jones because he thought she was rude i would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who , though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes , are generally nice people we did love the magic tree house series , both for the adventure and the personalities of jack and annie
i own perhaps 20 books on the bird 's and this is one of the worse mostly because the material is so poorly organized no real attempt is made to sort through the \( admittedly tangled \) move orders motifs variations in this opening also , the author seems to have a 'bad attitude' even though he plays the opening and has several examples in the book the section on the leningrad dutch reversed is better than the others but still lifeless
why is s douglas scotty slamming every car sales book on amazon but zig zigler 's \? do you work for ziggy or maybe a friend and pushing this book for him take a look at all of s douglas scotty reviews concerning car sales he puts almost everyone of them down but praises zigler 's book what 's up with that \?
this book does a good job of telling you what your ipaq can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it i wanted more information about how to set up my ipaq to connect with the internet the book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was , but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work
up to the minute \? \? \?
i remove children from abusive parents daily
the book mentions mannatech \( notice the manna \? \) and its product ambrotose snake oil , sugar pills ! not backed by scientific studies all claims are anecdotal , i e , are faith based mannatech products are peddled to the hopeful , the desperate , the last chance for me 's , and so this is not only doing a disservice to others , but is preying on people 's weakness the company is set up like other pyradmid schemed companies , using associates to pump its sugar pills , costing consumers a lot of money folks , there is no instant solution in a pill the associates make claims for cleft lip , down syndrome , obesity , all the terrible things human beings must bear in this world , and offer a pill made up of sugar to combat what is essentially a natural , human state in new zealand and australia , the govts are looking into mannatech beware ! the sugar pill recipe came in an inspiring moment to a scientist when in prayer to god excuse me , but while i believe in the power of prayer , i do not believe god drops manna pills from heaven god expects us to do our work , namely , do n't overeat , live with that cleft lip , get some exercise , eat your vegetables and fruits , read good literature and enjoy the sunlight
it 's no wonder that people look at me strangely when i explain a great love of history to them it 's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student if this book were more widely circulated , the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced i have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make it so boring that i would literally fall asleep reading it
i do n't understand why anyone would publish a book anymore with black and white illustrations i know this is supposed to be a classic and all that so it 's my own fault for not checking when i read the description i do n't even know why i'm keeping it i 'll never read it you have to wade through tons of technical jargon and lengthy chapters that would be much better served by some large color photographs maybe that makes me shallow , i do n't know , but there are much more 'complete guides' out there on this topic these days
i was seduced by the sinister cover and the synopsis on the inside cover into thinking this was going to be a chilling account account my foot ! i gingerly turned the first page and instantly drowned in wave after wave of details as if the rough draft was a series of scraps stapled together and mailed off to an impatient publishe
the 20 you need to know this book is poorly written , and the author would do well to use the 80 20 principle in his writing
anyone who knows me would tell you i truly enjoy reading i am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours it took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book the story just could not keep my interest i felt no real affinity to any of the characters i have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters she writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more in the case of this novel i just did n't feel it her other novels will not leave you dissapointed ugly ways is not a good example of the ansa 's true talent as a writer if you have not done so try her other novels i guarantee you will come away wanting to read more
the subtitle to this review should have been glaring inconsistencies outright fantasies i 've found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely for example , on page 7 coleman says the club of rome was established in 1968 , but on page 17 he suggests that the club of rome played a key role in the cuban missile crisis and attempted to sell its 'crisis management' progam to president kennedy unless we 've been misled , the cuban missile crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded what are careful readers to make of such a passage \? either it 's a typo and he means 1958 , or , as i heartily suspect , he does n't have a grasp on his subject on page 9 coleman suggests henry kissinger 's role in destabilizing the united states by three wars , the middle east , korea , and vietnam is well known however , kissinger , working at harvard from 1948 , had no role in the u s government until the 1960 's , working for the kennedy administration the korean war , as we are all aware , occured in 1950 , and ended long before kissinger had any influence on american foreign policy if it were true that kissinger had an influence on the united states' policy in korea , for example , then coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text however , he only leaves us with the cryptic is well known it is definitely not well known , and coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true
it would take a book to answer all that is wrong with farrell 's reasoning , but to make a few points
this is book was on the new york best seller 's list because it 's about new york , not because it 's well written or even interesting you run across a few gems throughout the book , but you have to be patient to get to them i hate to buy , start and not finish a book it seems like such as waste i 'd gladly skip the book if i had to do it over again
this was expected a fanatic relativist dismembers absolutist views into little irrelevant pieces our civilization has been jumping between absolutism universalism and relativism ever since its decline , with only a few people realizing a third alternative with this whole book based on a flawed definition , it is a pointless and utterly tedious read
first off , i have not read this book myself , so disreguard this review if you want i'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what i can tell here , and from descriptions from my own mother , i believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty train me i am 99 sure , but she does not remember the title so i ca n't be 100 sure
as i was reading this book , i came across many poems that were far too sexually explicit for my taste , to name a few the first , early images of heaven and full summer i found these poems to be highly offensive , and improper for the general audience
i looked at the 2002 printing as well as this 2006 revised printing in order to see what has been updated and all the reviews are identical why \? which edition are people reviewing \? i think amazon is making a mistake by not alloting reviews properly
we have to do better than this for our children controlling and turning your kid into the perfect little , well behaved lemming is going to haunt you until you die this type of abuse never has a good , long term effect on anyone put the paddles and belts down and talk to your kids they deserve at least that much
you can tell i do n't pay attention to wall street journal or new york times i picked up david sacks' book from borders' linguistics stack because of the title i should have known better
the hero is a cold , mean brute who does not deserve his gentle wife kassia he should have been made to marry joanna the shrewish woman he was betrothed to i could n't get past graelam raping kassia , i really could n't i know this is medieval england and women were more or less treated like chattel , but come on kassia is a gentle sweet girl who does everything to please this philandering , brute of a man he sleeps with one of the servants after he marries kassia , when she confronts him he threatens to beat and rape her which he had already done \( i shuddered again right there \) there 's not one but two women undermining kassia 's authority and she sits back and takes this , please ! the servants and his own soldiers abhor his treatment of kassia throughout the book i prayed for her to runaway with dienwald or for guy to fall in love with her and take her away from graelam the women who made kassialife hell were rewarded for their treatment of her , they are never made to pay for what they did to her which is another thing that put me off this book i like to see the heroine giving as good as she gets even if she 's not a particularly strong character kassia was far too soft and gentle for this brute as a result he walked all over her quite literally i wanted him to really suffer for his treatment of her which he did n't , this is why i bothered to finish this book for him to get his comeuppance which hedid n't she capitulated far too easily in the end when he came to get her at her father 's castle i know that he 's a warrior but did n't knights have a chivalric code
pinching a child 's trapezius muscle \? hitting him or her with a belt or a stick hard enough for it to hurt \? james dobson should be put away
dobson has this to say about the supposed 'strong willed child' even in infancy , he fairly bristles when his dinner is late and he insists that someone hold him during every waking hour later , during toddlerhood , he declares total war on all forms of authority his greatest thrill comes from drawing on the walls and flushing kitties down the toilet the strong willed child has a rampaging will
i wanted to be interested in this book , but it became pretty boring ater a while there is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose he claims to be neutral , yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship although the author claims to be in recovery , i did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives i felt that his narrative was self serving , and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation there is a price to pay what was good was hearing his father 's take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded that was interesting i'm getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960 's , 70 's and 80 's were i did n't like his picture either
my brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my dad 's side of the family he had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on accutane having heard bad things about the side effects , my dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication he faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever some of the ideas in the book are absurd as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne , i can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous when i was a teenager , i 'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible , and i got through high school with only the occasional zit i 've read that for a small number of people , diet can be a factor for acne , but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause \( this assumes you eat reasonably well malnutrition is n't sexy \) since medication should always be a last resort , a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes , but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere for the curious , while my brother had some strong side effects from the accutane \( none dangerous , primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes \) , it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin
this is a fine series so when i began this volume i had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others ms haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the texture of everyday life in imperial rome \( at the time of vespasian and titus in this one \) the dialogue and the characters are both engaging so what went wrong \? a young girl appears to speak with falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her and away we go , on and on and on ! i was weary by the time i got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful the length of this book \( 326 pages \) really cannot support so thin a story i was left wondering what had happened and if somehow i had missed something as there was so little going on
very disappointed with it was expecting something groundbreaking , but it failed to deliever an easy read and quite honestly , boring
i am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review that is pretty pathetic this book was written with no rhyme or reason there is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all one star is stretch plus , i am asian , and it was still hard for me that is when you know it is bad
this book , by the way , was published in 1988 , not 1998 as the notes above indicate it is also reflected in the books theme and attitude
i have read this book only once time , it tooks me about 1 hour , it is very basic , have not any important info , else that you can get from a free catalo
first a little background i'm 53 with a preteen son i'm not quite a luddite i make my living from an online business that i own and operate our big present to our son last xmas was a computer one he and i were going to build from scratch the main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work we gave our son a budget \( not big by gamer pc standards \) to shop for the parts
unfortunately , sidney wolfe and the whole worst pills business enterprise is riding on the reputation of public citizen as a champion for consumers , but has failed to live up to it with this guide in some cases , warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports , but rather , are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves hardly an unbiased , consumer oriented source of information consider as one example the book 's do not use warning regarding the prescription drug , armour thyroid rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation \( because there isn't any research \) , the guide instead quotes the ama and the american thyroid association , two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put armour a far less expensive drug out of business if this is the sort of unbiased information you want about the drugs you take , you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets if millions of thyroid patients taking armour thyroid were to follow the advice in worst pills , the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health i definitely do not recommend this book in any way mary j shomon , thyroid patient advocate and autho
i read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it a re read twenty years later gave me a different perspective macleans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best there are also a few glaring errors that i am surprised that his editor did not pick up on , two of note shaffer \( supposedly from montana \) is credited with a mid west accent \? \? montana is far west not 'mid' west secondly , nazi helicopters \? this is just plain sloppy maclean should have known much better
dobson has it wrong children 's susceptibility to god and the attributes of god has to do with rearing them with the love of god in their hearts from the beginning , praying and relying on god , and being taught to please god violence begets violence to spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator 's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional , physical and spiritual evolution of children ignorance begets ignorance , and if you 're in charge of children , feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child
i agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines , that was something like just ok , not great quot i 've been working w server 2003 for a while now , and from my work experience , i knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage i would read each chapter , read the summaries , take all the practice questions , and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what i 'd face on the exam unfortunately , i was right , and i just missed passing the exam this book is n't terrible , but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also
hank hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of israel is concerned he is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups , to include pretribulationists indeed , his scholarship is no scholarship at all it is pure propaganda to see real scholarship , get tim cohen 's materials \( see below \)
i found this book to be pretentiously over complexified the relationship between object and surface has been aptly documented by many other art historians of the late 20thc
this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything i did n't even like the story i would give this book a big fat zero if i could ! !
2 stars for decent writing \( at least a decent translation \) , for an intriguing start , and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf that 's pretty much it negative stars aplenty for the protagonists coy and tanger \( i listened to nc on 13 endless tapes , so perhaps am misspelling their names \) the tortured metaphors they speak , think , and by which they and their insipid adventures are continually described , bore to tears aside from an occasional scrape between coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss , all of the action in nc clusters at the beginning \( promisingly so , i 'll grant \) and the end \( all wimper , no bang \) of this novel as a salty seadog once said \( no doubt anticipating this novel \) , ahoy matey , thar she blows !
i hold martin 's song of ice and frie series in high regard the man is a talented writer for adults
this is a highly influential book roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency no one has had the same negative impact on roosevelt 's name to equal wyman 's attack but , although wyman , a professional historian has well documented his research , much of the indictment of the roosevelt administration is based upon conjecture incapable of proof the litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of auschwitz he asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of caring thousands of jews could have been saved but there is no way to prove this many jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate and jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria too much in his charges is based on too little evidence peter novick in his book , the holocaust in american life , calls wyman 's thesis a comfortable morality tale and bad history quot in addition to novick , henry l feingold , frank w brecher , and william rubinstein have written critically about wyman
cover blurb
i thought this book was a waste of my reading time i saw a review on the today show , and read several postive reviews as well , and it piqued my interest what i thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the coming changes challenges of a mother pre teen daughter relationship was a book about a mother seeming to tiptoe around her daughter 's emotional state what is sarah going to think about this , what is she going to say about that , etc \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that i applaud the time spent karen and sarah spent together something that should be done in all parent child relationships
but lana wood has a very autobiographical writing style i found wood 's memoir to be incredibly gossipy she speaks for pages upon pages about her own feelings during pivotal times in natalie 's life every here or there , it 's nice to have an eyewitness account of what happened at certain times , but i 'd rather read about the academy awards for which natalie was being nominated instead of the powerful men in hollywood with whom lana was sleeping there is a lot of name dropping as well as a lack of substance in the book 's context after reading this , i read suzanne finstad 's natasha and found it to be very thorough and much more detailed about both her personal and professional life i was not a fan of this book in any respect
i appreciate anyone 's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us however , i could see a hole in csikszentmihalyi 's attempt from the beginning
i was incredibly disappointed with this book purchase especially because i paid full price for it i have absolutely no use for it why \?
i must admit i usually write only positive reviews as i buy books very carefully this is unfortunately a wrong buy i like the shabby chic style and since she 's the person to get inspiration from on this style , i immediately bought this book without hesitation i must say i was n't inspired at all not even on one item and i am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag , browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market the pics are big but on flowers \? \? i think i should 've got the first book instead
i too eagerly anticipated reading this book , since i went through an apron sewing blitz this summer i was a bit disappointed , however although the photos and instructions are helpful \( for seamsters more accomplished than myself \) , the tone of the book is reactionary , with negative statements about working mothers and a lot of nostalgia for the ozzie and harriet era although geisel celebrates the rebirth of the domestic arts , she praises the home as nest \( enclave of traditional domesticity \) rather than the house as studio \( a diy workshop involving every member in open ended acts of engagement with economy , history , and culture \) still , there 's some interesting history and some great photos
this is not very good that is to say , the writing and the fluidity of gazzara 's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast
i found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities spend your money on days of knights and damsels by carlson
not recommended for native speakers of the english language
if i had been an editor and received deadly slipper ,
this book is very disappointing the writing is terrible and rather amateurish the writer bored me , maybe something 's lost in translation from french , i do n't know i already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book , although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work mara sounds stupid , immature and inconsistent skip this book , it 's not worth your time peter mayle 's mysteries set in france are way much better that this at least his novels have sense of humor , suspense , very interesting characters and most important , they are very well written
i was extremely disappointed by this book pamphlet , being misled by the other favorable reviews it is completely lacking in information it has 51 6 x8 pages with huge font and too many cartoons it successfully defines what is good and bad posture , but does not provide excercises to improve it \( it simply states to practice good posture \) there are much much better alternatives i have read posture alignment and recommend that , and have heard of great reviews for posture , get it straight !
this book is the typical package of business ideas the book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful in addition , there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work the author does state that what may be work for one person , may be play to another however , this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you do n't mind putting in the time or work the title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort , which is not the case for many of the ideas \( masonry , restauranteur for example \)
and you should n't inhale
