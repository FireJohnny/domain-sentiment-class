sphere by michael crichton is an excellant novel this was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the crichton novels that i have read
dr oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation he describes how he combines complementary medicine \( e g hypnosis , reflexology , yoga , message , acupuncture etc \) with orthodox western medicine there is an excellent forward by dr dean ornish , and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques the bulk of the book contains stories of patients dr oz treated using this revolutionary way i am a cardiologist , and i have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine , which is the reason i bought this book however this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment nevertheless , those interested in this new medicine , which i think will be the medicine of the new millennium , will want to read this book
the most gorgeous artwork in comic books contains the most extraordinary artwork of alex ross \( superman , batman , wonder woman , the justice league , etc , even hanna barbera ! \) a comics fan , i recieved this as a christmas gift , and i read it again and again
this book is for lovers of robicheaux his demons seem put to rest , redemption seems almost within his grasp and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages the poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade burke 's prose as always , but his anger at humanity 's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface hurricane katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing a bit like robicheaux himsel
this is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length i want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful , engaging and thought provoking story
since i am a world 's fair fanatic i have read almost everything that i can on the subject in general , this is an interesting and well researched book the author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about however , i must point up three rather glaring errors in the book in describing the louisiana world expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be 80 feet tall , just 150 feet shorter than the eiffel tower since the eiffel tower is actually over 900 feet tall , the new orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall this may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time the other error states that the us pavilion at the brussels world 's fair of 1958 was a large , squat , round concrete block structure it was indeed large and round , but not squat and not made of concrete blocks according to the excellent book about edward durrell stone , the architect of the pavilion , the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light i have seen photos of the us pavilion , and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me \( in comparison to the soviet pavilion , which resembled a large refrigerator ! \) thirdly , the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the u s s r exhibited at a u s expo they had a large pavilion at the new york world 's fair of 1939 all in all , however , i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world 's fairs
this the one book that taught me more about how to use my slr than the camera 's manual itself the step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography i also liked the way mr frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter one take without the filter and then the same one with a filter also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field an encompassing book , the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment the peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown a good buy and money well spent my only gripe is that i preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
tom friedman is a engaging writer he also writes from a very personal perspective , both as to how the world has changed for him and his family , and for his friends around the world you get the feeling that mr friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching what a treat and a very easy read pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the us shores
john crowley 's well deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the english language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980 's his great work of time is an intriguing rashomon esque time travel fantasy about cecil rhodes and british economic imperialism in east africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries it was almost as compelling a read as the the nightingale sings at night , which offers a fantastical twist on the adam and eve creation myth saga the other two tales , in blue and novelty , i found much less compelling , but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose crowley uses in other tales it was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library a surprise which i think many readers will also discover
this story captivated me right from the outset , as vivian copes with age related loss of memory her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail , and she is a very realistically portrayed
i found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk i visit at least once every summer i love going there and looking to see if i can find a book that i have never heard of , by an author i 've never heard of , and buy it on a whim this is the novel i bought last year i has , unfortunately , sat on my shelf since then until tonight , because of many reasons tonight , however , i picked it up and read it cover to cover the narrative was brilliantly told , the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching if i had made it to the end without some tears , i would believe myself made of stone !
i checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as i cracked it open i knew i needed a copy of my own it is full of simple , tasty , and easy to prepare recipes i really like how most of the recipes do n't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are i was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence i 'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine
i sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america in absolute awe ! with almost 200 contributors , almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations , editor andy smith and oxford university press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken whether you are a food professional or interested amateur , a historian , sociologist or anthropologist , a student or scholar , these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in america the scope is astounding , spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products , from ethnic , religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in american history , and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in america despite the enormity of this work , it is refreshingly approachable , set forth alphabetically , written in clear language , translated when needed , and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further as a food professional recipe developer , food writer and culinary educator there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive
i borrowed this book on cd from the library and half way through , ordered the book so i would have it to refer to excellent book , highly recommended helps to put a realistic perspective on millionaires
i saw the 1963 classic first , which happens to be one of my most favourite ghost movies of all time ! \( what a major disappointment the remake was \) so as soon as i could a got a copy of this it was an awesome novellete i read it in one sitting , could n't put it down ! i do have to say i enjoyed the movie better but this is a great journey as well
while expertly crafted , this is not a pretty novel , nor is it gentle the subject matter abduction of a child is somber , as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying the plot twists and turns , as befits a lehane novel , and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying but you can usually trust lehane to take good care of you in this , one of his finer books and not only are there plot twists to wrestle with , there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head all in all , this was a solid , enjoyable thriller the reader will feel his time was not wasted
awesome this book is worth its weight in gold for the insights and understanding it shares with a professional background in finance , economics and a profound study of the word of god , the author is well qualified to expose mammon for what it is , and to challenge the reader to a deeper surrender to the only real treasure worth having buy two and give a copy away can we have a new edition please
this book does something i 've never seen before it shows a cool young homo boy who 's punk rock and a skater , not some wishwashy queen boy sam , the lead character , is really cool i 'd like to be his friend , and his boyfriend , but that 's another matter also , the dude he likes , clay , is really hot he 's a surfer , but he 's not a stereotypical surfer , he 's much cooler , and also a little punk rock i love this novel the ending is really sad , but i loved it
fear nothing is about christopher snow , whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways , but chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is , and even that his little town of moonlight bay is stranger , and scarier , than he thought chris then sets out with his friends , and his dog , to find out the truth about what 's really going on
i'm not even a vegetarian , let alone a vegan , and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait ! unless you hate veggies , this book is a must have ! i just made the herb scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right , it 's hard to believe there 's no cheese or cream ! the pizza with caramelized onions , kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too ! lots of yummyness
very good , easy , light funny read ! although his best , by far , in my opinion was running with scissors this was an enjoyable read would recommend reading his work if you like david sedaris , both have a similiar style
reading this book is like having a holy vision i feel as if i should tell the world about it , but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe i should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me , into my life , into my head
beautiful vineyards , fueding families , mystery , and an unlikely love story with a twist great read prepare to read this one through because it was hard to put down ! ! !
the book arrived as expected and was in great shape thanks
paul sheldon , a very good writer famous for his books in the misery series a popular character in his book is someone named misery in his final book he kills the character off , therby ending the series paul 's number one fan is annie wilkes , a retired nurse \( i would like to say , retarded \)
as i read , i kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people , whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it 's just a good tale peppered with strong political images
the andromeda strain tells the story of a bacteria growth in piedmont , arizona this bacteria kills people in a matter of seconds and killed everyone in the town except for a 69 year old man and a baby a top secret commission is formed to see how these bacteria kill people and to see how they can be stopped
still a great read , but not as good as tender at the bone and comfort me with apples foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol , but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom , dad and other relatives and friends the highs are not as high , nor the lows as low in garlic and sapphires reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader that said , i hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book
very good writing done by both authors i 've always loved c c now with du brul , the story gets even more suspenseful a really awsome page turner get this one
this is most definitely my favorite book on earth ! i'm so serious , this is such a cool book it really appeals to anyone kids could read it because there are short sentances and pictures \( some tough words though start with epiplectic \? \? \) but teens and adults \( i'm sure \) can also appreciate the morbid and brilliant humor of edward gorey for anyone that thinks that 10 is too much to spend on a little book , \( \( you may be right in some circumstances \) \) but this is such a fantastic book i know i am gushing but i love it soooooooo much ! ! !
even though you know before you start reading that this book will have a happy ending , it is a fun read a well written and pleasant book one of the best of this falls crop i am already waiting for the next book in the series
i found this book to contain some really sound advice and i would suggest it for anyone that was contemplating risking their money on the ponies
this was the first novel i read from endo , and i have to confess to being hooked on it from the first it is both interesting from a historical perspective , taking in an event that was singularly fascinating , and deeply profound from a psychological perspective it is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day
i was given this book by a friend as a going away gift the day i decided to read it , i was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting i was a bit drowsy , but i could not but it down it made me nervous , excited , sad , and happy all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
dry is anything but what the title of this work implies the pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on augusten burroughs breath a must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction the writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth , funny , yet foreboding and diary like in its presentation burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it , especially the limited usefulness of rehab the story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call , a hard core drinker as he anticipates the next one passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas , job and sexual conundrums dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them this is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle , yet has a strong finish an earlier work 'running with scissors' was apparently good enough for hollywood , so take a shot with dry after all , when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do , it might be time to slow down , stop and get a copy of twelve steps and twelve traditions , and a copy of dry cheers ! !
omg ! ! ! i could not put this book down i am in my upper twenties and i am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already yes the book is bios about natural progesterone , so what i have not personally used progesterone cream yet , because i am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that 's what i need but even if i do n't , everything else provided in the book is amazing information your diet , your vitamins , your stress level , your physical activity , everything is co related to most woman 's hormonal imbalances they even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life , she achieved hormone balancing if you are suffering from hormonal imbalances , i will strongly recommend this book i also bought other ones that i will be reading after this one but i started with be lean by romy seleznov , which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did , then i continued with this book , and the next one i will be reading is natural hormone balance for women by uzzi reiss , which does cite this book as well
whilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress , it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget , which colours match , which accessories never date , and how to dress for evening functions of any nature
the quirky illustrations done by the masterful dave mckean at once contribute to the book 's charm , but also lend to its dread however , this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares some people may not appreciate dave mckean 's artwork as much as they should , because it is so different , at least to those not familiar with the sandman graphic novel series written by neil gaiman in which dave mckean did the cover art for all the books at first glance the layout might seem confusing , even distracting , yet it somehow works here neil gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing he introduces us to a charming young girl named lucy , who suspects something is not right with her home and though her pig puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear , the rest of her family do not until it 's too late the action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end , though perhaps it is not you be the judge this is a worthy book to read to third graders and above , though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern neil gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience , one so unfamiliar with his other work i highly recommend this book
if you are planning to become a landlord , buy this essential book before you purchase a rental property or hang that for rent sign in front of your house a healthy dose of legal reality will counterbalance any easy money ideas you may have and help you decide whether the work and risk involved in being a landlord is how you would like to make money the legal concepts you learn may even influence which properties you buy and how you maintain them
this is the story of another tragic episode involving a native american tribe that this probably happened under other circumstances , and happened to more than the arapaho tribe , cannot be doubted this is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more the characters are strong , believable , and you want the best for all of them the underlying plot selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died is heartbreaking the reunion of one such child with her father made me weep and vicki 's trial reconciliation with ben gave me hope this is a great work , written with deep feeling
this book was extremely well written it 's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all what totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time , i have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20 's she most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end for example , on page 233 , and if all the gifts of life are good , perhaps , too , are all the shapes she chooses to take , and which we cannot alter the book is filled with hints at the time period even though , after looking at countless reviews , the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that lud in the mist did not and it was a fantastical piece of literature in my opinion , this book was totally based on the time period there 's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he 's not white anymore he has come down in the world if you 're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20 's , this is an astounding piece
my husband bought this book for me and i have to say it is not a book i would normally pick up i also have to say i loved it ! it was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way i enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer
a team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the earth 's surface in antarctica they set off on their adventure only to learn that a team , like themselves , was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again they also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind but these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team
this rather strangely titled book is a tribute to the demand for elizabeth bishop 's work it is a set of pieces gleaned from some 3 , 500 pages in the vassar college library collection not exactly random \( but almost \) here are 108 poems , some prose , notes she took , some sketches , some facimilies of her papers , some sketches she made , and other pieces harder to describe
this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it it is warm and comforting a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what
my fav essay was about the river also , now when watching the evening news , the link between fire and flood makes alot of sense thanks for the enlightenment
i was a reasonably big fan of the wizard of oz when i was a kid i 'd seen the judy garland film , the return to oz film , my parents had taken me to a theatre production , and there used to be a cartoon series about dorothy and her friends that i quite liked here in australia , though , you do n't see an awful lot of the wizard of oz books , and i missed out on all that as a kid i managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story , and i really liked it it 's really a shame i could n't find it earlier
this book was wonderful the rich grandeur of the south is alive in this story of unimaginable dedication and love this book had me teared up more than a few times
we know some things about saul of tarsus \( later named the apostle paul \) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information most everything we know from paul is from the dr luke in the book of acts or paul 's epistles themselves ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements peter , in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates paul 's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them
i 've been reading a chapter a day for over a yr it 's a great motivator for the day ahead i 've found this translation to be the best i 've read other translations have been boring or too dense this one was very powerful
this is the first novel by philip roth that i actually like portnoy 's complaint was a good hundred page novella , spread out over a three hundred page book the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions , and his kvetching about his parents operation shylock was also too pre occupied with pushing a political agenda \( but just what agenda , we are never sure \) this is roth 's primary fault as an author he is too didactic i find that i really do n't care much about what roth 's political opinions are ironically , this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling it shows that he thinks deep thoughts
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
if you want to buy the book , go ahead , just be careful of superbookdeals , they take your money but do n't deliver and do n't answer emails caveat emptor
hugh hewitt is right on target encouraging republicans to remain loyal to president george w bush we are confronted with a long term fight against islamic nihilists the democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s indeed , if the democratic party returns to power , the war on terror will be severely compromised if not lost even theological modernists like myself recognize that the republican party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order and yes , we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like senator lincoln chafee but what about the republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands \? these folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006 many of them possess a suicidal nietzschean streak in their heart of hearts , they idiotically believe we should let the democrats win so that the republican party can be purified the author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis hopefully , he starts to do so real soon before it 's too late
just when you think you 've got gemmell figured out , he turns the tables on you fans of gemmell and jon shannow might find the book a bit slow at first , and something of a retread of previous jerusalem man tales , but be patient the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve ! readers unfamiliar with shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous stones of power books before this one you wo n't be disappointed gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late 20th century
i have spent my life wishing that i could change things over which i seemed to have no control rob explains that the reason for this is that my subconscious mind is holding on to old beliefs that are limiting me he goes on to tell how psych k is a safe , powerful , and simple way to change those beliefs using balances that integrate the hemispheres of the brain it is prayer coming true for me quickly and lastingly i have followed up reading the book by taking the basic and advanced training workshops and am using psych k to find peace in my life and am helping others do the same in theirs this book is written so that it is easy to read and very informative for someone like me who is looking for ways to improve their life
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row , at least in the state of mississippi , and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however , some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain
i just finished the book today and i will start out by saynig that this is a very good read i will not spoil the plot if you have not read this book oh , and this book is not scary , but it really is creepy give it a go

we would expect a well balanced approach to writing about the work of the holy spirit in the church by the author who also wrote tyranny of the urgent and we get it ! in this book , charles e hummel , former president of intervarsity christian fellowship , first reviews the history and growth of the various charismatic groups within both the protestant and catholic churches he provides many valuable explanations of the meaning of related scriptures as well as observations of healings and prophecies that he himself has seen he later gives his recommendations for keeping the holy spirit fire in the fireplace of a biblical church body i came away encouraged in my own spiritual gifts and reminded that the more extraordinary spirit gifts have not disappeared and that to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
i 'd definitely recommend it not only to the knowledge management professionals , but to the general public it 's a fun and easy read
blanchard and hybels and hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a christian point of view while reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership , they put together an excellent framework for leadership the summary checklist , given on pp 171ff , offer a helpful concise summary of the book the glaring omission , and one that i ca n't believe that hybels would make , is to clearly point out that following jesus' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with jesus , in other words , you ca n't lead like jesus if you do n't have him in your life to help you i ca n't believe that there was n't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further i believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book but for the christian , it is an excellent book
many novels of the african american experience in the united states use the theme of passing these novels generally involve a light complexioned african american who can pass for white among other things , novels based on a theme of passing allow the character and the author to comment upon black white relationships in the united states from both sides from the black experience and from the white experience
you , the reader , are the subject and the hero of calvino 's novel , an exercise in reader response theory gone mad calvino 's lively experiment begins by describing a reader \( that is , you \) reading calvino 's novel and , after this opening , you settle in to read the novel that you were meant to be reading a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter
this is my all time favorite book ! i have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book it is definately one of nicholas sparks bests
deadly feasts tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book it tracks the discovery of prions , the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease , scrapie , and creutzfeldt jacob disease following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties , bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties , and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on , rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists , from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation , yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school , to the hyper competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were
this book was very candid and well written it shows that bob primary goal was to build a business , and become rich and he succeed the idea that he sold it as a media for african american pride is what got him in trouble pulley shows that it was strictly business mr johnson need not so defensive , what he created made him rich , this book shows that wealth does not equal respect \? nevertheless he has 3 billion dollars and hopefully plenty of time to write a final chapter of which he can be prou

having spent the last year in the near east , i found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues while this book was written about the isreal lebanon issue during the 1970 's 1980 's , though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months , it was as i said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture with the world attention squarely on the near east we all , weather american , european , or other cultures throughout the world , need to know and understand the near eastern mentality , culture , and to some extend how the islamic religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area with this book being written by a jewish american and with thomas freidman 's understanding of the near east way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for i recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the near east , politicians and military personnel , religious leaders , and anyone who wants a better understanding of the near east in general
i just finished reading the handyman 's dream , by nick poff i was completely blown away ! this is a great book its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town indiana after the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner the story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that i havent seen in any other gay novels i love the way the author integrates music and songs into the story from the character norma \( ed 's mother \) and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful mrs penfield , the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do this story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past , and one many still have today i love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks anyone who believes in the power of love i wish while growing up i would have had a book like this one to show me that there is such a thing as good , healthy gay relationships i highly recommend the handyman 's dream

if you 're interested in reproducing authentic costumes , you wo n't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book i have n't found anything close to it intended for collectors , it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather until a generation or so ago , no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat it 's a valuable addition to any costume library

i saw the second title of this series at my local borders bookstore , and decided to try the first title do not be fooled by the young adult category this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read though a little adolescent at times , this novel is still excellent , and i recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy
when peter s lynch speaks , wise investors will listen this book covers the famous fund manager 's career at the helm of fidelity magellan from 1977 to '90 , and post career into '92 it 's far more introspective than one up on wall street and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose for example , there is n't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former my belief is that the reader would do best by reading one up on wall street first and follow up with this title , as its the newer of the two , regardless

never before have i been moved so completely by a simple reference book the author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for l ron hubbard 's dianetics not an easy task i bought this for my grandmother and she hates books that 's how good this is better than cats , she says i ca n't say i necessarily agree with her for starters , the private sector 's influence on public policy and decision making is nowhere near as entertaining as mister mistofellees' song and dance but who am i to argue with an old woman \? nobody , that 's who

i am a longtime jance fan and was n't disappointed with dead wrong any complaints would be the overemphasis on joanna 's pregnancy with a concomitant under emphasis on tension and suspense \( great ending , though ! \) butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book , but also comes across as overly self absorbed , especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child jenny , too has little to add to the story but joanna shines , as usual nice to see such a reliable , ethical , and strong female protagonist
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book , it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it , even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion , i could be wrong
i liked this book because it was quick and easy to read , but also had more in depth information in the back each month , there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the er , call your doc , or wait 24 hours to check there were great decision guides that presented both sides i like that i know a reputable hospital stands behind the book , as well i have 6 pregnancy books , but this one is my favorite
background
terrier will not disappoint tamora pierce fans ! the narration is done through first person , told as a journal this is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story , and difficult to account for actions the narrator has n't seen but tamora has performed her usual magic , snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last \( i even read all of the notes pages and the bio \) readers may find it difficult to put down once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo
this is the third book i have read by grisham , and so far i have really enjoyed each one grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller this book does not have any courtroom court case scenes , which i really enjoy , but it still kept my attention very well grisham gives you just enough inside details to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer for example at one point , the clues seemed to point to fletcher coal being involved in the killings , but that was way off the mark in the end this characteristic of grisham 's writings makes for a very enjoyable read
i bought this book because my mother is dying and i needed to know more kessler has a wonderful way of delivering this knowledge he is thorough in imparting this knowledge and does so with total compassion for the dying and the living i underscored many passages in this work and especially appreciated someone telling me \( chapter 8 \) what can i expect in the way of physical signs as mom goes through the dying process this book is very user friendly having a very readable quality i strongly recommend it
this collection of stories and essays by david sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety overall , i found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful some stories were a bit dry , but others such as santaland diaries and diary of a smoker had me laughing out load however , the best stories i found were the ones such season 's greetings to our friends and family ! ! ! which i had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor i would definitely like to read more of sedaris' works , especially those based on his real life experiences as , overall , i found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories
guys and dolls is a fantastic musical , and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it unfortunately , some songs like marry the man today , my time of day , follow the fold and the oldest established have been left out from the book , but that is the price you pay , or rather do n't pay , when you do n't buy the full vocal score however , this book will satisfy fans of the show , complete with pictures from the original 1950 broadway production , the 1955 film , and the new 1992 broadway revival definately , this book is a good buy

in this fascinating collection of essays , dr dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis over the last twenty five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies , an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms , subsidised housing , free by weekly pay checks , child support and free medical benefits from a liberal political standpoint , this support for the nation 's have nots is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor one would logically assume that providing the poor with life 's essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society in fact , as dalrymple proposes , it has had an opposite effect crime in his native england has skyrocketed drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence why \? liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives , it is always the rich , the government or societies institutions that is to blame , thus crime continues to rise while england 's welfare state has grown into an unwieldy goliath
this is a pretty good book however , i would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of lincoln 's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective

this is a simple , yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural china of the 1920s and 1930s the story centers on pei , who as a young girl , is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory the story evolves as pei befriends other women in the silk factory , participates in a strike for fair working conditions , reconnects with her family , loses loved ones , and escapes from advancing japanese soldiers the plot is succinct and the characters are interesting , varied , and believable , if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth socio cultural aspects of life in 1920s 30s china are elegantly woven into the plot themes of friendship , love , and courage are convincingly presented overall , the book is a captivating read , and strongly recommended
this thing sat on my shelf , half read for the longest time only the notice of the upcoming release this november of pynchon 's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again it 's not that it is n't brilliant no one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder the first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you 'll ever read
this is a great book i will not go into so much detail as the previous reviewers , but i must give credit where it is due having read many books on the subject of the bush white house including , fiasco , and state of denial , i did not think i would learn much more from this one i bought the book a few days ago , mainly because i like david corn when i read it i was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is i think along with the two books i mentioned earlier , this trio make up the essential reading on bush , iraq , and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories if you could only read one , i would call it a dead heat between , hubris , and , state of denial if pressed i suppose i would have to give the edge to hubris , as the writing was much less tedious i thought

this bible blew me away when i went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life i was so impressed , i bought one for myself this bible is many things , but the first thing that i noticed , quite honestly , is that the colors were bright , the print readable , and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical bible without growing to an unwieldy size , the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information , written in a modern , friendly style , that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the good book both understandable and relevant to today 's society that is what makes it perfect for someone , like my young friend , who is unfamiliar with religion , christianity , or just plain old bible study it 's less intimidating that most bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you do n't feel unprepared if you pick it up cold catholics are often les familiar with the bible than many protestant denominations , as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile however , a better relationship and understanding of the word can only enhance one 's spiritual life and experience as a catholic if that applies to you \( which , i have to admit , it did to me \) this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in biblical translation , discussion , interpretation , and modern relevance who wo n't like this bible \? 1 those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the king james version 2 those already familiar with intensive bible study , if not working with youth or those less familiar 3 most protestants the discussion is from a very clear catholic viewpoint not really controversial , just catholic 4 and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the bible accessible and relevant through use of the lingo parlance and point of view of today 's under 25 set i believe one reviewer felt that the bible did n't need to be made culturally relevant , finding the sidebars on race , cultural differences , modern morality , and varying interpretations to be just another extension of the political correctness movement i could n't disagree more the bible should be the one book that everyone can see themselves in should they seek such a thing this bible does that for a new generation of catholics and for a new , hesitant group of explorers i 'd ballpark the appropriate age for this version at around 13 35 years
i handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they could n't order any more reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in europe that he carries you along i especially love the story of little portugal , which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one the us could learn from that example , and from many other european examples in this book when you read the story about ge and honeywell , you 'll realize we 're going to have to , because they 're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not

i listened to isaac 's storm on cd while painting a room , and it made the time fly ! the cd rendition was clearly spoken and had excellent production value that said , i also loved the story i am a weather hound , and i enjoyed the detail of the way in which the nation maintained it 's weather bureau \( i had recently read the children 's blizzard and i would consider this as a nice companion book for we weather hounds \) the descriptions from survivors was threaded effectively along with a panoramic view of the galveston tragedy i have not read the book , but i found the cd riveting
in his book trading risk , ken grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for tudor investments and sac capital to create an insightful and surprisingly non technical guide for traders and portfolio managers as director of trader development at a large proprietary trading house , i have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders moreover , this is a scalable difference risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades , results of trading days , and performance across entire quarters where i believe grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply cutting your losses trading risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades , from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results his discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of self analysis that is rarely practiced
once again i am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject i bought this to get a better feel for the old testament operative word is feel as a roman catholic , the old testament is addressed in the first reading at mass , but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner it is particularly confusing , hard to read , and difficult to understand in proper context , without some help in fact there are portions of the old testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous davis 's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people , in a certain time and place , and within a historical milieu it may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like , but it is sufficient to be effective
i was fortunate enough to have seen the now legendary vermeer exhibition at the national gallery of art in washington , d c during the winter of 1995 96 21 out of the 35 or 36 extant paintings by vermeer were included in the show , offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of vermeer 's amazing works in a single space , something that no one has experienced since 1696 , when 20 of his paintings were auctioned in delft given the rarity and fragility of vermeer 's works , it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated all who were unable to make it to the show , however , have this splendid book as a document of this unique event this book will remain the standard work on vermeer for many decades , and represents the fruit of several years' labor by art historians on two continents because so little is in fact known about vermeer the man in truth , we have no idea at all what vermeer 's education , interests , and personality were like , the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing vermeer 's work within the history of dutch painting , the development of perspective , and the fascinating tale of vermeer 's rediscovery in the 19th century and his richly deserved rise to worldwide fame the essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers , as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct vermeer 's exact technique , something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves no drawings by vermeer have survived , nor have any statements he may have made about painting this extensive scholarly apparatus , while illuminating and occasionally even riveting the essay dealing with vermeer 's rediscovery is a great detective narrative ! , tends to obscure the strange , even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with vermeer 's personal world so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano the music lesson vibrate with dramatic tension sadly , the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures all of which are superbly reproduced in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue what is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry , novels and countless studies \? i was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images , but the traditional overly scholarly and dry art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the sphinx of delft that said , the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist barring some new discovery , it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about vermeer and his world than can be read here , exquisitely designed , and distinguished with beautiful reproductions the volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book when i attended the show , the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback johannes vermeer is the text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon immerse yourself in vermeer 's world and you will be transformed seeing this exhibition changed my life , and i treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time i hope you will enjoy this book as much as i have

while this book had some minor flaws \( i 'll discuss those briefly later \) , it is worth owning , especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of cirque du soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every day the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic , the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances
yes , it 's cliche yes , the plot is lifted directly from star wars yes , there are obvious references to anne mccaffrey , tolkien and other fantasy writers but who cares \?
i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly , i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience , especially in nyc 's best restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective \( as objective as food tastes get , i suppose \) review a very easy and enjoyable read

give up dieting forever ! i have and i am now losing weight eating anything , yes anything , i want can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened \? this is the book that will set you free , this is the book you need has it struck you that dieting is unnatural \? do n't eat this , do n't eat that , count this , count that , measure this , measure that , i ca n't have this , and i ca n't have that , ad nauseum which diet guru are you going to believe \? can you reall stay with a low carb diet or a high carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life \? most importantly , do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life \? the first day of my new eating pattern i ate two meals the second day , i woke up with no hunger , no reactive hypoglycemia \( nausea and shakes from hunger \) ! what a miracle i have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything i want for dinner \( i love to cook and desire to eat with my family \) at maintenance , i may end up eating two meals a day i do n't know and it certainly is n't something to worry about the diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later , etc , are wrong , wrong , wrong maybe it sounds theoretically correct , but it does not work that way listen , i have found out the less you eat , the less you eat i do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach by the way , dr dean edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself he says there is no scientific proof that x number of meals are better than one also , i want you dear readers to know that i have four friends who are naturally slim \( adult women 30 's and 40 's \) two of them eat a small amount for lunch \( like a small hamburger \) and a good dinner \( they are sizes 3 and 6 \) one gal eats at 2 30 pm , a huge amount , and a snack at night \( she is size 7 \) one gal does nibble all day , like a potato chip here and there \( no thank you , personally \) oh , and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner , never lunch remember my comeback for sabotagers slim people do n't need much food , even if we exercise who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two \? the only negative thing i have to say about diane 's book is that i felt she took scripture out of context god fed the israelites manna 2x a day they were supernaturally filled and nourished he does not feed anyone manna today also , biblical gluttony is not overeating \( i do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin , but not gluttony \) biblical gluttony refers to the roman type parties where people overate , overdrank and went on to commit more sin on the positive side , i do believe diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism this book is an answer to prayer you wo n't be sorry if you buy this book
i really liked this one because of the characters and of course the background being about wine and the lifestyle of those who create it \) i definitely recommend this one

this book provides the reader with a clear , basic understandingof the grounding of popular opinion regarding gay life during the last50 years while the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope , this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life , and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are i only hope that it will inspire others whose experience of being gay is a relatively new one to realize how important political activism and community still is not only that , a very engaging read
loved it highly suggest it could n't put it down
with over 1000 recipes , this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it 's paces , but i 've had great results with the few dishes i 've tried so far the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked , with a gem of a condiment included pickled red onion i 'd use that on any sandwich , anytime the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette \( really a sambal vinaigrette \) and wasabi cream were awesome veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners

what a wonderful book this author has written it talks about developing interpersonal skills , public speaking skills , prospecting skills , networking etiquette , sales skills , marketing principles , and even customer service it mentions the power of the thank you note , and of giving more than you receive it also devotes a chapter on some things about home based businesses and a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing , and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity i'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included quite frankly , i think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here and i think chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book , and not included in this book either but who cares ! anybody interested in the main thrust of the book \( endless referrals \) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 and they are well written and informative

the authors map out clear , effective and proven strategies for rewarding parenting in this excellent well written guide an imaginative approach was called for when my 16 year old boy jonathan threatened to barricade himself in his bedroom using just twigs , leaves , and his own spittle and dung , and this guide provided just that there 's nothing wrong with setting parameters , the authors say , just as long as that are not arbitrary or capricious and they are clearly articulated and for crying out loud why should he be allowed to act like a nesting african hornbill under my roof

the position enjoyed by mohammed as a prophet of god is disputed by his unprovoked attacks on innocent people islam was spread by use of the sword because americans are poorly educated on religious history in general and middle eastern history in particular , this book is a must read it is a single source for how islam became as powerful as it is today the editor uses multiple sources to document the facts necessary to allow the reader to support the assertion that islam is a violent religion
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking , which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it , i read it as a novel , for entertainment years later , i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading , i was able to examine the russian names , characters , events , and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog , which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going , which it certainly is , but in it , tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence , each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space , with one atom colliding at random with another , but when a sufficient number act in concert , such as napoleon 's invasion of russia , their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar , he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom , who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self deluding as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms , then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature this one tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one or any other deity , but he does say that history , time , and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path , and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go , then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov , who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going

liz perle does a really nice job in money , a memoir of weaving statistics , professional studies , and other people 's experiences with her own personal experience and insight while many parts of her book sound familiar \( e g , women shopping when they 're in a slump \) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard the other thing i appreciated about the book was that perle does n't claim to have all the answers , and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money , which to me sounded like something i could attempt and achieve thanks , liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read

this is the best book available on the great storm of 1900 and its effect on galveston , texas an unbelievable amount of research obviously went into it very well written highly recommended
mcneill calls american indians and africans little more than the victims of the west in this book he explains that they have little role in the development of culture \( which he sees as passing from society to society from mesopotamia on , like some sort of conceptual olympic torch \) and some get it and others do not it is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history , and difficult to read without cringing
red lily is clearly the best book in the series while reading this one i could visualize the scenes this book would make a good movie , but i ca n't decide under what category it would fit into although it 's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller with all the talk of a ghost \( as the rest of the series \) this book it is n't a believable read as much as a fun read
for those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one , you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through the writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of china and its muscle power instead of branding china as a villain , we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains , china would n't be where it is now wal mart is covered in detail the writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing , it 's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when china has perfected its manufacturing bases just as japan and south korea had done before it then , there 's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located , and how china is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour china 's progress is n't simply detrimental to other countries on contrary , it benefits them as well for example , australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to china with increase of living standard in china , chinese needs more nutritious food as china could n't provide enough , united states particularly the middle states are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the middle kingdom then , there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping united states in check by siding with china , and also the love and hate relationship between usa and china of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in china and so forth whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided \( since china has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time \) , suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks yes , some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately , i think they are missing the points what 's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about china and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come highly recommended

i just finished the book last night , crying as i read the last few pages i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press she was a delightful and woman , filled with life , which makes her ending even more tragic the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde

every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator the mid first century of rome was such a time and tacitus was such a communicator the histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history the historian will do well to read tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity while observing and commenting on the human element in history , tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil , wars , and rumors of wars his beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity his example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow
philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references he gives the reader a wonderful sense of the social , religious and political forces that motivated the pilgrims in their incredibly risky venture into the unknown the book presents a fascinating view of the clash of the native american and english cultures that tragically led to the near annihilation of the new england indians
i enjoyed reading the mark it was definitely a page turner of course it makes me want to continue with the series tim f lahaye is a great author and story teller i actually visualized the whole the thing i would thank him in person if i could , for a wonderful job done
first , the strengths andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists , with chapters on munsterberg , arnheim , eisenstein , balazs , kracauer , bazin , mitry , metz , and ayfre , and agel he focuses on the debate between the formalists \( who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing , framing , mise en scene , lighting , and etc \) and the realist tradition \( who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography , a physical impression of its subject \) the highlight is undoubtedly andrew 's excellent discussion of the great french critic andre bazin , which is not surprising since andrew 's ph d thesis was on bazin the weaknesses this was published in 1976 , and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then , especially feminism , and the influence of lacan and psychoanalytic theory still , this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory
hi i would say most people should run , not walk , to buy this book it does n't matter where you are starting from , everyone can benefit from this stuff , and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about i found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money i would recommend it to all my friends , especially those who are befuddled by the markets , because it has simple straightforward advice good luck to all the savers and investors among us ! for socially conscious people , they also tell how to help society \( as well as get wealthy
tony sweet 's photographs are breathtaking ! as you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way , you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work i am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work i think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book

being a dyed in the wool mcguane fan , i think he just keeps getting better not only is he the best fishing writer alive , but his non fishing stories are bizzarely entertaining , have an interesting twist , and always explore human interaction i believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences , from crazy street people to ego crazed ceos , as well as the many places he has lived who else would know what a cabinet is , except a rhode island resident \? what no mention of hot weiners or coffee milk \?
i was anxious to try the artisanal gougere recipe , and i was not disappointed ! the cheese puffs were light and cheesey and beautiful to look at ! i compared his recipe to le cordon blue recipe , and his adds a pinch of baking powder and about 2 3 times the amount of cheese plus he give approximate mixing times , which was a blessing for me since i had never made cream puff dough before the cordon blue version had no mixing times and with such a small amount of cheese compared to the artisanal version i cannot believe that it would be anywhere near as good this book appears to have terence 's personal touch , not just regurgitation of classic bistro recipes
based on 20 pages of an unfinished charlotte bronte manuscript , you forget that it was written in 2004 and are quickly enjoying what feels like a long lost bronte ! ms boylan takes into consideration charlotte 's growing concern \( at the time of her death \) with children born into extreme poverty and deprivation the plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan \( emma \) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to london 's back streets of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel

having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but , this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy , it is extremely informative and , if read with an open mind , refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on just to let the information sink in

i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly , i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience , especially in nyc 's best restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective \( as objective as food tastes get , i suppose \) review a very easy and enjoyable read

as one of america 's greatest presidents , ronald reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and , like abraham lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations this book and his earlier autobiography , where 's the rest of me , will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions this work , an american life , however , will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life , during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor for anyone who had the pleasure of listening to reagan 's political commentaries on the radio , or hearing him speak as governor of california or as president of the united states , the book will be particularly enjoyable for it is written in the easy going conversational style that reagan used in life what makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which ronald reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today you may also observe that the problems of reagan 's day are not much different than those we face today i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand ronald reagan , how his many faceted character was formed , the inner workings of his mind , and the actions which led to his monumental achievements in my view , it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every american child
jeff shaara never ceases to amaze i have absolutely loved everyone of his \( and his fathers \) books i have been waiting awhile for him to delve into world war 2 and he did not disappoint me first things first , i could not put this book down everything about it was phenomenal icant explain it in any other way please read this book even if you dont like books like this it is well worth your time
i love historical fiction , and the march was one of the better historical novels that i 've read the characters are well drawn , and the action moves along briskly , with no dead spots the civil war background seemed very authentic , and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions , the march blends the two to show that war really is hell
are you ready to become a home gamer are you seriously looking to improve your current results in the stock market \? do you have a moderate level of knowledge about the stock market and our economic system \? are you equally concerned with preserving your capital while earning a better than average return \? do you prefer a system that incorporates probability and statistics as a tool to assess risk \? are you a believer in using fundamental analysis and technical analysis in choosing growth stocks as your preferred investment \? do you have adequate time and interest to devote to actively managing your portfolio \?
the pelican brief is one of john grisham 's more fast paced and exciting book
i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away , it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places , like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world
i love this book in conjunction with dr perricone 's books they compliment each other nicely a great tweak to feeling and looking better
for those of you who might find the first found book or this second one offensive in its content guess what \? life is offensive and for that matter , life is also often tragic , poignant , ironic , hysterically funny , random , and sometimes all of these things at once the found books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life that 's what makes it so remarkable indeed , how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages \? this work by davy rothbart , co editor jason bitner , and all the found crew deserves praise because this is a cross section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials if , several thousand years from now , \( android \? zombie \? \) archeologists study our current century , they might go through our trash think of found as giving them a headstart

john lynch wrote a classic in spanish american revolutions 1808 1826 he masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of latin america from spain the book starts in rio de la plata and ends in mexico and central america curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the creole ruling class the reluctance of spanish monarchy \( and later even of liberals \) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the creoles \( spanish born in america \) for all of those who are interested in a better understanding of latin american societies of today this great book is a must lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the hispanic american societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis two thumbs up

i recommend that most people do not read this book if you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway , please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so \( and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on amazon \) magical realism jewish history , religion , culture and humor \( although the last is perhaps redundant \) memory folk lore the english language love the nature of histories sex death pain narrative style and voice the multiplicity of human , and likewise jewish , experience imagination i will assert , because i hope it is true , that you do n't need to all of these things to enjoy illuminated , but you do need to be familiar with some of it and you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it all those with self diagnosed a d d need not bother cracking the spine however , even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you , everything may be indeed sadly obfuscated or perhaps less disappointingly , only partly obfuscated if so , do n't get angry do n't curse the gods or creative writing programs and certainly , if you are going to write bad reviews on amazon , preface it first with your own faults as a reader lastly , buck up read another book even the bible \( another little book high up on the best seller 's list \) is not for everyone

my only caveat about this otherwise enjoyable installment in the eve dallas series is that the web site did not prominently state \( i e , i missed it ! \) that this had previously been published as part of an anthology i made the mistake of only checking the publishing date , decided it was a new novella published independently \( as would be deserved , given the track record of the series \) , and ordered it without checking further my bad but a reminder to readers who want to buy everything from the series be sure to read the description carefully enough to determine whether it is a previously published in a book you already own item !

dorothy parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past her wit is biting and at it 's best in this collection , favourite reads are for the individual to decide , however , for me , as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance , as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye , for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle

in some ways km soehnlein 's the world of normal boys reminded me of the teenage novels of paul zindel there is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time zindel wrote specifically for adolescents soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post pubescent boys and its social implications although the book is written for adults , it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us
this is a book about beauty , passion , a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts , especially music , craves and feels , the fire that burns within a book that dares to take one , if one dares to take that step , on a journey deep into the bare souls of it 's characters the story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot , or develops into dramatic changes for the characters that is not what the author wanted to convey , and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity , and not expect the characters to travel actively without the book gives us these people , the town , the surroundings it brings us deep into the realities , the thoughts , the complexities of the human soul the people are good , bad , ugly , beautiful , selfish , depressed , found , or lost but from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in mick kelly 's soul , and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town , then the author reveals her own soul with her words , for those that pick up on what her words show i am still amazed at the power this book has any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book , should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous
gods and generals is an extremely well done and fascinating book the author , jeff shaara , did an excellent job of interpreting the characters his task was a difficult one because his father 's book , the killer angels is a classic in the chronicles of civil war stories this book precedes the one written by his father
i picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching mystic river , the film based on another lehane novel darkness , take my hand did not disappoint different characters , same setting , and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil lehane 's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing , a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre lehane 's descriptions jump right off the page at you his characters are so human , so intense , their dialogue so sharp , that it 's almost like watching a movie in your mind there is n't a wasted word in this book the suspense starts to build on page 1 , and never lets up , becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter this is a stay up late read to finish only when you 're not alone in the night

gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor on page 16 , he writes a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries , department buildings , and museums then he asks but where is the university \? this is the category mistake cartesian question where is the mind \? has a same confusion , he asserts
the concept of mind is a great book for several reasons the main reason to me is that ryle clarifies the concept of being human , while he uses language in a natural way in stead of constructing concepts based on \( for example scientific \) assumptions , he shows what we already see as obvious , just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language he is far from reductionistic mark the subtle irony 'man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine he might , after all , be a sort of animal , namely , a higher mammal there has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man
different , refreshing , entertaining , funny , eye opening even better than reading the book is to listen to it \( buy the audio cd ! \) on a loooooong drive

loved this book i think that this is a must read for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation the only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it working in the field , we see first hand the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals i wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal i will say that i cried during parts of the book

while not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as aquinas or pannenberg \( as another review here stresses \) , this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence this is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of scriptural data concerning each topic , its apologetic engagement with differing views , and its practical counsel for life and ministry it is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions i recommend it highly

until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions as rogers clearly points out , most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon an inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors

imagine you 're attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you 're doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water in essence , fire your boss is just that stephen pollan 's discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of careering in not just corporate america but any occupational arena it 's an easy , conversational and straightforward read that imho should be called hire your boss pollan , a life coach with the style , chutzpah and hubris of a donald trump scott adams hybrid , elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace your boss pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it 's helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations simply put , managers will continue to act purely out of self interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives with this in mind , what will avail those of the non management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision , with more of a hired gun approach rather than that of a sycophant many of pollan 's precepts will at first seem counterintuitive such as work for the money , the love will follow or lose your career , get a job and may come across as trite and cynical however when taken in context the underlying schema is this a job is a means of providing income no more , no less trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self destruction the author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market
i liked this book , but i notice that all the critics seem to hate it it did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off i picked it up because walter laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism written in 1886 , it suggests that there is a pan european anarchist underground , which the protagonist gets mixed up with it is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy , who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction the prose is wonderful , as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters' personalities , if you have the taste for that sort of thing all in all , it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel i finished it with regret i had previously read and liked portrait of a lady , which is a superior novel as much as i liked it , i would have to say do not start with princess as an introduction to james incidentally , i have a theory about the omniscient narrator in james' books being a malign demiurge , but i will spare you that theorizing here

though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through , your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read gaston bachelard 's the poetics of space bachelard argues that language especially poetry can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space , especially of our home space for example , he considers how common phrases such as go up to the attic and go down to the basement are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends , while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended as he does with other such observations , bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives in addition to exploring how we experience space and place , bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight roughly speaking , he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something by reading this beautifully written and engaging book , you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived , grown up , felt comfortable or alienated , had a feeling of wonder or fear , etc i recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space , in language and what it can reveal to us , or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language

i was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of nebula award winners this book is not at all your typical sf story , indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some sf aspects than it does an sf story i'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction , so this holds a good deal of appeal for me

the first book in nr 's 'born in' series is wonderful , you do n't want to miss it ! born in fire focuses on maggie concannon , a tempermental and loyal woman who is also a gifted artist gallery owner rogan sweeney takes an interest in maggie 's fabulous glass creations , and soon after takes a personal interest in maggie herself maggie is a wonderful character , stubborn and flawed , yet still caring nora does a fabulous job of developing maggie , and does it in a way that she seems like a real person rogan is an extremely likeable hero maggie 's sister , brianna , is her complete opposite quiet , sweet , and calm the relationship between the two sisters , however , is very touching and very real this book is full of colourful characters , some we love and some we hate the romance between rogan and maggie is wonderful basically , i just ca n't say enough good things about this book you will love it
cahill 's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste this is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained some missing context , some missing closure and they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense , as stories may focus on nature , archaeology , sociology , etc while the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference , there is good information \( ex wisdom of cave diving \) some stories hit the vicarious adventurer 's sweet spot the author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in kentucky , engaging the reader with educational content \( ex barometric effect on air flow \) , spectacular descriptions \( ex lightening igniting bat guano \) , and hair raising suspense \( ex getting lost in a maze of passages \) not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me , but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits
by far a very thorough and intelligent read i could not put it down
spring snow is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written , as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right it is an eloquent , moving story with a tale as old as time , that of star crossed lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations
i read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market the phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half the raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the new era story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay but as shown by proven evidence of the past , no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later when this happens , the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible the story so far is quite simple but what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained
a late divorce is one of my very favorites novels this ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle aged couple , one of whom is in a mental institution , is told from the perspective of each member of the family children , their spouses and mates , grandson , etc i have rarely laughed so much , or been touched so much , by the insightful description of the kaminka family and their travails over a failed marriage , real estate and conflict the scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity at its best a wonderful work , original , illuminating and funny
i agree with the first reviewer this is what art criticism , politically engaged or not , should read like berger was an old time marxist i am an anglosphere conservative he is a man of the left i am of the right no matter , his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism , and at times philosophy , that i have read incredibly perceptive , sensitive , without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition , berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended he uses history but is not a historicist , for he lets the works reveal themselves openly the essay that which is held , a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of time is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of montaigne berger will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary europe danto and the americans are simply not in his league
i have enjoyed all of david gemmell 's work but this one takes the prize it contains sorrow , great sacrifice , courage , honor , and some of the best battles every written it is easy to see the scenes and the people as you read , the characters are ones you will become attached to if you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day , you will love this book
in order to properly understand the jesus of the new testament , instead of making a jesus of our own liking , it is necessary to understand jesus as he himself indicated jesus himself , according to the new testament , made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures , \( old testament \) , as he sought to explain himself , his actions , his teachings and his significance understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what jesus was and is about this means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it , and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole christopher wright 's book , knowing jesus through the old testament , is an absolute godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the jesus of the new testament this book is a little bit technical at times , it is not a devotional work , but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of jesus , thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of jesus according to the background that jesus himself referred to thanks chris wright for this fabulous book also see his forthcoming book , the mission of god , due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press it looks to be another bullseye ! ! for some other great little books on jesus that are sane and sober , see jesus and his world by peter walker , the original jesus by n t wright , and for a bit of a larger work see jesus and the gospels by craig blomberg
this book provides a straight forward approach to a raw food diet , and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process it also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally , but schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need a great resource to go to when you get a nagging question , or have a concern try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet , as you will see changes in the health of your pet many veterinarians that i have spoken with are not particularly supportive my 2 y o lab has a softer coat , clearer eyes , and better muscle tone since i have started him on the diet this diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow , but the reward of having a healthy , happy pet far outweigh the associated costs good luck , and enjoy your pet
a comprehensive , entertaining and plainly written introduction to critical thinking it should be in every school and public library \( preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with pro creationist caveats \)

ordinary joy reminds you that god is in fact all around you in your ordinary living if you just take a break from all the hustle and bustle and truly appreciate his beauty joe campeau uses personal illustrations that we can relate to , and in turn , relates them to the teachings of jesus on a personal note , my own faith has waivered for quite some time that after taking a closer look , i am rediscovering god 's presence in my life and i know that , no matter what , the sun will shine tomorrow and i will be kissed by son again and again and it can never be wiped away peace and joy
the mysterious oriental mirror is ugly , and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected it wreaks havoc and sometimes kills , as is the case with several people in this book the rest are either thought mad or driven mad question if you could , would you switch places with somebody else in a different time \? i think i might , but i would like to be given a choice brandy mccabe and her granddaughter shay garrett are n't given that choice both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other 's bodies
this book provides a very interesting and informative detail of the history of birth culture in america as discovered through the study of birth chairs in incluedes intriguing pictorial documentations of birth chairs and how they evolved into the modern maternity beds in use today
having read katherine , i wanted to get my hands on another anya seton novel her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the medieval and renaissance eras are breathtaking people recommended green darkness because of its timeless romance , historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation so i gave green darkness a whirl this enormous book \( a big trade paperback with over six hundred pages \) enthralled me from beginning to end and i wish it had been longer , that the magic had n't ended despite its rather large size and intricate story , the novel ended too soon for me \( i like big books , but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume \) i finished this gem in three sittings the novel 's setting begins in the late 1960s \( around the year this was first published \) richard mardson takes his beloved wife , the american heiress celia taylor , to his estate in sussex , england there he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers , all respectable noblemen and women like richard but something strange begins to happen between them celia is experiencing deja vu , as though she 'd been there before this happens the second she enters the castle at the same time , richard becomes restless and moody celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her their lives and their marriage could be in shambles , and celia has to go back to her previous life during tudor england to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time her past life is a woman named celia bohun who falls for a handsome monk named stephen \( richard \) mardson their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering there are many twists throughout the novel
a jules vernes classic , this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time true , there are some items that may seem a bit dated , and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible yet , this novel is still a joy to read
i was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here even more stunned by the criticisms this is not a scientific treatise , and never pretends to be this is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of emergence , nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper
a wonderfully told cat tail ! the illustrations are lovely and appropriate to the playful theme of the book
i love this cookbook there are so many amazing recipes as someone who is allergic to dairy , i am totally blown away at how creamy some of the dishes are besides the recipes , the book is filled with beautiful pictures and profound quotes that combine together to create a really special reading experience i highly recommend this cookbook to vegans , vegetarians , people allergic to dairy and wheat , and meat eaters , as well
i am a kindda new wife but struggling with learning how to grow up and not be a nag stormie is very easy to understand in her book and can relate to almost anyone like another person said i do feel like this book was written just for me the written prayers help me bc sometimes i dont know how to pray for my husband and this gives u the words to say and scripture to back up everything she says also , it helps me more importantly be a better wife this isnt a book to try to get ur way and mold and change ur husband i 'd say its about giving urself up to the lord to change u and make u a better wife and praying for ur husband is selfless and probably one of the most important things u could be doing i highly recommend this book , highly it changed me almost instantly !
i have read all of van gulik 's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite the characters are intriguing and some sinister the end is satisfying and bittersweet , challenging integrity vs justice i would , however , recommend you read the others first \( chronological is good , chinese gold murders is first \) to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own
this is in my opinion john bradshaw 's best book it encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions , addictions , co dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes
i love this book ! i love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last \( i say maybe because originally buddies was supposed to be the last \) it is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested my love for dennis savage 's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with little kiwi my love for little kiwi 's innocence becomes concern for his actions it 's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result , the choices that they make are theirs , and there 's nothing you can do about it , but let them be chosen it 's hard letting little kiwi grow up and become virgil brown i imagine it 's the same way with a child , but at least then you get to see what happens ! mind you , the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle , feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next but just like just above my head by james baldwin \( which i highly recommend \) , i have been unable to pick up this book and read it again it simply leaves me realing with so many feelings , yet i would not trade the experience reading it with anything how does one mix merriment with malaise so well \? read the book and find out
this book will be invaluable now as i am going to groom my dog myself the instructions are easily understood
i love joanna brady ! however , this introduction to her and her life in bisbee is not the best book jance has ever written one thing that is terrific about jance , though , is that she is from bisbee and describes the town in exact detail bisbee is a quaint crazy town and jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert joanna brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by highly recommended ! !
this is a cute story about a spider who drops in on a farm all the farm animals greet her and invite her to play but the spider spends the day building her web instead the book is fun and informative , and not at all scary the pages are doubled so they are easy to turn , but be careful , because inquisitive little fingers may reach inside the pages and rip them the book has about 350 words
collins' efforts with his justly famed the moonstone and the woman in white have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in armadale lydia gwilt \( do n't you love the last name \? \) is one of the great unsung characters in english \( or any western \) literature collins seems to delight in making her as full bodied , as attractive to men , and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire given the tenor and social conventions of the time , her quest for revenge on the despicable alan armadale seems perfectly in keeping lydia gwilt is like an early , english scarlett o'hara without the redeeming humor scarlett was known to exhibit all in all , an extraordinarily well written and three dimensional character study
i evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that i needed more protein than i had thought and that i reacted strongly to sugars i bought this book when i decided to lose a few pounds , but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet i was already having gall bladder and liver issues i bought this book first and 2 5 years later , it is still the best reference i have the chapter on hormones is a bit technical , but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book
three of my nephews and my son 's favorite book he wore it out and i had to buy another one
i thought that the two books previous to this in the duncan kincaid gemma james series were slight disappointments kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with gemma taking the lead in a dark house is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
this is an excellent book the anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides the authors book on senegal parrots and their family is also full of information
on the surface , natsuo kirino gives us a book loaded with nail biting , page turning suspense what lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in japan women are seen as beautiful young pets , or useless old bags kirino shows a side of japan that i did n't know existed
as a therapist \( 16 yrs \) , i have been using the material in this book for reframing the experience of depression for my clients the clients i have introduced this book to are now reframing their illness as an intiation into a greater understanding of their relation to self soul while at times dry for most laypeople , it has become a reference book for my practice
in response to the guy who said this book is n't scientific i say , it 's as scientific as the diagnosis \( which is essentially a catalog of behaviors that annoy teachers , but i digress \) there 's no scientific proof that adhd actually exists as a disorder since we do n't understand the brain , or why it does things , how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything \? choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start the book is worth your time , but you should also check out hallowell or ingersoll
among all the theories of ethics with which i am familiar , i have always found kant 's system to be the best carrying out one 's duty for the sake of the duty itself the problem with kant , however , is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity , dependent on a source of which we can never , some may claim , have any understanding christine korsgaard fixes , at least for me , this problem , by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality in short , the source of normativity is our humanity itself
highly recommended ! the text is engaging and very informative clear possibilities for implementation
i really enjoyed this book it was a few good laughs over a few good dumps what else can a goomba ask from a book sittin' on the back of the cammode
i found lovemaps a valueable and insightful look at the way individuals relate to sexual behavior and establish their sexual identify and desires based on life experiences which as dr money indicates occurs in childhood and which is unconsciously formed by the individual i found this book extremely helpful while working on my doctorate in human sexuality and now 6 years later as i continue my research and work as a sexologist and sex therapist i highly recommend this book to other sexologist and clinicians , as well as any man or woman who is interested in learning more about sex and sexual behavior and in essence more about themselves it definitely helps if you read a book before judging it and this book should be in everyone 's sensual library live with passion , dr charley ferrer , author of the latina kama sutra , the w i s e journal for the sensual woman , para la mujer sensual , el kama sutra latino , the passionate latina in our own words www instituteofpleasure org
the art of the table a complete guide to table setting , table manners , and tableware , is extremely thorough in covering all the details related to proper table etiquette author suzanne von drachenfels makes it so easy , and entertaining in the process , finding the answer to any mealtime dilemma
wells wrote the time machine \( 1895 \) rather furiously it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel , summing it up in a tightly constructed , very short novel most works that i have read from the nineteenth century are long winded , purple toned , velvet like effluviums this one is short and for once i would have liked a book a bit wordier
rose madder was one the first books that got me hooked on stephen king this story is phenomenal , in my opinion i have to admit the first time i read it i was a little confused i was not one to be to much into sci fi fantasy type stuff this , like any good story or movie is best when it is read a few times then you really get to pick up the subtle hints that you may have missed before then again i am a bit biased rose madder is right at the top of my list of most favorites \( just below bag of bones
i picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading instead i was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until i 'd read most of it the main character , in my opinion , is janet , the mother i think it 's more or less in her voice , and that is why she is the most developed character

wow ! ! ! this is a ton of great information from a 'been there , done that' mom and grandma
i got my copy of the five keys to value investing as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor he thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before i start my career on wall street i was not disappointed the five keys is a very good summary of what i learned in business school and much , much more the author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like buffett and graham the experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile but what makes this book very special is the framework i have read several investment books over the years , but none like this one putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw in addition , reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work the clarity in the concepts and the conversation like tone was particularly attractive to me in sum , this is a very coherent , practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective considering the authors' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing
when i first started reviewing children 's books on amazon com i gave myself a long list of rules to follow and one of those rules stated that i was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until after i 'd written my own review i wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure , filled only with my own thoughts \( which i obviously mistook to be brilliant \) and feelings after a while though i gave up on this rule by and large \( and this is not speaking for all reviews just 90 of them \) a review for a children 's book goes something along the lines of it was good , my four year old requests it every night , buy this book , etc nothing too shocking or revealing so i grew lazy i started reading other reviews of picture books long before i sat down to actually write a review of my own just moments ago i went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book , martin 's big words this book was on my list of must reads because it had garnered itself a caldecott honor years before so i went to the appropriate amazon com page \( much as you are now \) and read the first review on the list at the time , it was an unassuming july 18 , 2002 review entitled , there 's something wrong here i read the review i digested the review and i came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones ones that i should consider , dare i say , in my own review this is unprecedented never has a review for a book , a children 's book , really hit home for me like this one did so to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002 , i commend you and to myself , a mental whipping for breaking my own rules it 's a hard act to follow , but i 've a point or two of my own to make and i'm gonna make `em
i loved this book i love it so much , i want to give copies to my sisters , my friends and to get my husband to read it the ideas seem so simple and straight forward , that when you read it , you say of course , i can do that in my life

ibn batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native tangiers \( morocco \) in the 14 c by avoiding to travel the same route twice , he comes to the same places a number of times \( baghdad , delhi \) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas as he explores with brio this world , he unfolds himself and as in most cross cultural encounters , this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book he accepts miraculous events with a candor i have not found in any other middle age traveler of those lands \( from marco polo to the jesuits \) he gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits which i regret apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the sheikhs of the places he visits the descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how \( extremely \) fragile power was and is in those regions
i lived in a situation somewhat like that richardson describes we watched vietnam from 1000 miles away , but the players were the same it was like living at the far edge of the welsh marches in the time of the roman empire maybe if you have n't lived within a bureauocracy you wo n't understand , but everything he says is true
a must for any afterlife library the chapter entitled mothers chapter is worth the price of the book alone i know it will be hard to put this book down a delightful 2 day read
there are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade , but at least in terms of the international movement of capital , you 'll usually find mere boosterism and ideology at last , paul blustein has given us a look at the real life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation here we have an in depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of argentina 's economy in 2001 2002 , which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship you wo n't be surprised to see the word bubble regularly , as blustein covers the surprisingly slow moving factors that added up to disaster over several years , with many mistakes made by all parties along the way

i found this book to very informative in a nutshell , it tells you how food is processed throughout your system and it 's reaction like , fresh vegatables can be eaten with anything but starches do n't digest well with meat there are stages to going raw that ms rose has honestly and clearly put out there our bodies just ca n't go raw over night yhere is a change in the digestive system i know from my experience how my body feels when i eat raw for several days and then introduce the wrong combonation of foods i feel like i'm suffering at the toilet sorry natalie gets you through the stages of developing this life style it 's a detox program not a cookbook it has recipes for all the stages to going raw ms rose hershelf claims it took several years for her to go completely raw the recipes are for those various stages i do n't find anything wrong with this book as far as enzymes all foods have them , and yes our body has them too when cooking foods you are breaking down the enzymes that are packed with nutrients that simple we want to incorporate more enzymes or natural living food into our bodies
i enjoyed this novel it was n't hiaasen 's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read
only about two hundred pages , jonathan spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful , mysterious , fascinating , and frightening persons of the twentieth century though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of mao 's life or policies , it is best to look elsewhere this book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of mao 's life and work and ideas perfect for people curious about mao and twentieth century china who want to read more than an abstract , but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work just the facts and little commentary spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences
this book opened up new database opportunities for me without it , i would never have unlocked the real power of mysql 5

through forster 's impressive command of the english language and advanced character development , the story of helen margaret schlegel unfolds the sisters who are highly educated , pensive , and artistic become entangled with the wilcox family practical , unilateral capitalists and the basts working class and unassuming however , the initially subtle differences between the sisters \( and how they approach love , misfortune , and personal relations \) become more obvious as the novel progresses , climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high brow english novel \( i think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end \) human nature notwithstanding , the novel 's refinement , gorgeous writing , and riveting story telling prevail to the end i loved it !

i just finished my second reading of it
i first read this extraordinary book in 1986 , just two years after it was first published picking it up again , i find it eerily applicable to our current situation there is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it the march of folly brings this message back to the forefront
when my sunday school teacher gave us the challenge of reading through the bible in a year , i thought it was going to be hard so i started looking for a one year bible when i came across this one i was really excited it is by far my favorite traslation because it is so easy to read i can get through the daily reading in about 15 20 minutes it breaks down the hard to read old testament into easy reading and one of the best parts is that it breaks down the reading by day , so you are not constantly going back and forth between the books truely one of the best bibles i have purchased ! ! !
many stories in this book reminds me of the famous essay silent spring the writing style is extremely accessible to every body and yet delivers a significant amount of knowledge , advice , and sometimes wisdom the author carefully explains medical terms and implications , thus easing the reader 's mind without using a medical book this book is highly recommended to anyone who has a curious mind
kate white introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel over her dead body
as a health writer , i know that pharmaceuticals can be very dangerous compounds but for years , i overlooked the fact that drugs are n't good for pets either your cat can probably benefit from safer alternative treatments martin zucker has put together a wonderful book with top veterinarians do n't keep alternative and holistic treatments to yourself share them with your pet
i loved this book ! i read it in a single day i have read everything else of maupin 's and strongly recommend this novel , too this is probably my favorite book of his
'the regulators' is not quite on the literary level of 'desperation , ' but that makes it more fun in a way , especially as it 's less preachy i liked that 'the regulators' adds a little more information about the mysterious tak here we see a more terribly playful , oddly fastidious , and possibly younger tak who loves spaghetti , chocolate milk , westerns , and cassie stiles and while most of the characters of 'the regulators' are flatter than those of 'desperation , ' 'the regulators' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of desperation might have been like before tak possessed them , particularly audrey and collie who were never shown pre tak in 'desperation
a looming 21 year high school reunion has led me to ponder the past , especially the town i grew up in i have been reading the geography of nowhere by james howard kuntsler , a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in america kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy \( le corbusier , gropius , bauhaus etc \) although kunstler 's book is by no means a complete history , his insights are provocative his basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless geography of nowhere in other words , since the 1920s , americans have pursued a single minded vision when it comes to urban development namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold , with little regard to aesthetics
very few books can weave the historical narrative with an account of the subject as mr derbyshire does it in this book whats more , he does total justice to the subject by making sure persons who should get their credit does atleast so the author 's canvas is huge and he almost reminded me of how much i missed undergraduate math
extremely well researched mcchesney has been a key figure in the media debate and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity his disciplined , almost scientific investigation is an example of non partisan coverage of a crucial issue if only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as mcchesney , we would be in a better world i am a mexican citizen so i could n't care less about u s partisan politics , and if you care about the fate of public communications , you should n't either this is a problem that affects every country , not just the u s a , since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the world the interest of big advertisers is being protected by u s policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere even the smallest community in the south mexican jungles knows ronald mcdonald cnn has latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most latin countries as an outsider , i hope the u s citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of democrats vs republicans but a world wide issue of the individual vs the big corporations in reality they do n't care about your political affiliations , as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products , you can debate each other to death
woodward and bernstein , famous reporters for the washington post during the watergate scandal , chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of president nixon and his cronies during watergate this book takes the reader through woodward and bernstein 's efforts at uncovering the truth , internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering , and covert meetings with confidential sources they tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world 's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the us presidency was respected above all else
a lot of the reviews i have read here , both positive and negative , have noted smith 's acerbic and sometimes hostile tone in my own discussions on god , particularly when engaging christians , i probably would not use some of the more harsh language found in the book it tends to be devisive and unproductive , and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to atheists
golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies , especially in this novel and in the inheritors \( 1955 \) , on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology the central symbol of the lord of the flies is that of a pig 's head upon a stick stuck in the ground , a totem in the making perhaps , but seen by golding as beelzebub , the lord of the flies , the devil , a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies
a lot of these reviews say that they 've read this book and it 's done wonders for them and everyone they 've recommended it to the book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things gawain suggests it 's not a miracle cure all book it 's about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you i read this book in college when i was going through a little bit of a rough patch , figuring out what i wanted , etc now that i 've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world , i need more positivity in my life so i'm re reading it in the hopes that i can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again i highly recommend it to those who are open minded enough to give it a chance
not only a terrific portrait of louis b mayer , but a wonderful history of hollywood movie making my caveat is the portrait of dore schary while eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between mayer and thalberg , eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the mayer schary conflict in the last part of the book , possibly to correct the view of mayer the monster and schary the savior in earlier mayer bios his portrait of schary , a man i knew , bears no resemblance to that decent , fair minded , and gifted man it is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of schary eyman claims that schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals , yet schary in his post mgm days produced a successful musical , the unsinkable molly brown whatever good flims came from mgm during schary 's reign are dismissed as the work of others he creates a portrait of schary as a talentless hack , forgetting not only the good films schary wrote in earlier days but the successful broadway play he wrote about fdr , sunrise at campabello he writes that schary only spoke of himself in retirement i knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends if he can get schary so wrong , it forces me to question his other judgments having said all that , i think this is a fine book , evoking old hollywood with grace and style
if you are planning a trip to italy , this is a book you should take with you
wow i had to have this book they are right , he explains everything wrong with oracle and all about vulnerabilities and exploits
as soon as people see breton 's name on a book , they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim , the dictator of surrealism ! what they do n't seem to realize is that , despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man , he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body nadja is simply one more delightful proof of breton 's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal , the mysterious , the mystical , and everything that is profoundly divergent in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly , clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja , which is the russian word for hope the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma , things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her at the end of the novel , nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior , some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton 's , and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end it may be true that breton 's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate \( she died of cancer , insane and completely alone \) is indeed nothing to admire , but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her , he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before , and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity , even while the second world war raged and reaped it 's devastating results universally on all of mankind , to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence , however 'absurd' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism , but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism' , the philosophical justification of human misery , at all costs can only call forth our admiration his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct , concrete experience of life as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow , our inner lives \( hopefully \) become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible do n't be fooled by the 'anti breton' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him , because you 'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books \( to my mind \) ever written
this is one of the most insightful books i 've ever come across the author is simply a genious embracing the principles of this book may be the difference between developing a successful business or not

nicholas nickleby is a significant dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses the protagonist 's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama , comic relief , political satire , class comedy , social criticism , and domestic farce , they allow dickens the opportunity to portray , to the minutest nuance , an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics the main frame of nicholas nickleby is a quintessential dickens a generic , virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate nicholas nickleby has committed no fault and offenses , and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world , to be separated from the people he loves , and to be proscribed like a criminal the more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life , the more profusely the novel accentuates dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice
this book is highly informative , updated to include everything up to around hero 's trial \( new jedi order \) , which makes it a must even if you already have the more presentable star wars encyclopedia while the encyclopedia has more interesting and fact filled entrys , it 's also hideousely out of date , a problem that this one would easily correct ! i read it cover to cover in a few days , and was quite impressed with how much research went into it , and how few errors were made even so , i have to say i 'd recommend this book mainly to fans experienced with eu stuff , lest they quickly become lost and overwhelmed

the reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded the conversations in the book are intelligent , the characters and dialogue are real , and the descriptions and settings are vivid while the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon yale and new haven , it is sometimes hard to believe , especially given that the author has been a faculty member at yale law school for over twenty years this is not to say , however , that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate rather , they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university \( yale \) and those that are not

i 'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here but i would like to say that i do n't have much time for reading , so make sure the books i choose are those by authors i consider 5 star j d robb a k a nora roberts is one of the most prolific authors i 've ever read how she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination i 've read this series out of order , but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone this one , however , revealed to me the reason behind eve 's sometimes belligerent attitude , her strong persona , and standoffishness robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts , inner turmoils great book

one of the best new authors to date , and possibly one of the best writers in the history of the english language ! jasper has a very firm grasp of the language and creates a slightly twisted version of reality where people jump into books , fictional characters jaunt around the real world \( hamlet \) and books have a tendancy to re write themselves characters include jane eyre \( of course \) , the cheshire cat , the red queen , hamlet , and a slew of minor personalities from books out of print \( for good reasons \) if you like puns , you 'll love this series
i loved the four agreements by don miguel ruiz , in which he
simon winchester is a popular historian , in the modern mold this means that he 's socially and politically a liberal , and that he 's interested in everything connected with a specific event he 'll examine it from all angles , and attempt to see it from everyone 's eyes , look over everything connected with it , and then draw some conclusions usually , those conclusions over reach some \( i'm being general about this type of writer , not of winchester specifically \) and the point of view is relentlessly modern
this is truely a funny book it of course is the origin of the ma and pa kettle movies , yet much more i like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle when you read it , you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were , although , it is a good read on that level too , i e seeing were our culture has been and where it is today i did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work good grief folks , lighten up read the thing for what it is a funny story meant to amuse when i was a kid , i did not read micky mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness , nor social commentary \( although , being a dog lover , i was not always happy how pluto was presented and treated \) nor did i compair the micky of 1949 to the micky of 1952 anyway , digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine i suppose , if you are into such , but for me , i just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it

i liked this prep guide because it 's not one of those huge books that 's impossible to fit in your carry on or laptop bag if you 're traveling it has enough information to pass the test , which is good enough for me because that 's all i needed to pass the test this month but , if you 're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right , this is not the book for you the book does n't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam , just enough to pass it the only draw back to this book is that it does n't come with a cd with a comprehensive set of sample test questions i had to go to one of those huge books that i bought a couple of years ago for that , but i did n't read the huge book

citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man , thorby , as he matures from boy to man starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar , baslim , we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom , though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men' the society he paints here is vivid and believable \( though the economics of slavery in a star travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me \) baslim is far more than he appears to be , and puts thorby through a rigorous education , both academic and practical how do you become a really good beggar \? here heinlein falls in with ayn rand whatever you do , do it to the best of your ability , from begging to juggling also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums these are items that may pass over young readers' heads , but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined , nothing should be accepted on 'faith' , that personal integrity is more important than 'success' , that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action
written all the way back in the mid 1980s , long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the us today , this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient i feel like i would have had a much better understanding of this subject \( not to mention appreciation of the people involved \) had i discovered it a long time ago , but i suppose late is better than never

many people remember the battle of midway as the turning point of the war in the pacific due to the sinking of four japanese aircraft carriers , and rightly so but would the american success at midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons \? probably not in this eye opening account of the battle , author alvin kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who , flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes , cleared the way for the sbd dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the japanese carriers

part geology , part biography , part history of scotland , this excellent book is a tribute to james hutton , the originator of modern geology starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth , the author weaves the intriguing story of james hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth 's true antiquity the political situation in eighteenth century scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which hutton lived but the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after hutton 's death is also discussed , ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them this is a very well written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience

kenneth pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of iran from the rise of the persian empire to the reign of the pahlavis \( pp 3 100 \) pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic iran got wary of meddling foreigners , starting with the hated russians and brits , in its domestic affairs \( pp 4 , 41 \) many iranians have angry psychological scars , believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons \( pp 26 , 71 , 89 , 99 , 125 , 128 , 155 56 , 161 , 173 74 , 242 , 297 , 389 \)

lords of the earth is the term the yali warriors use to describe themselves they live in the heluk valley in irian jaya , and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains the first section of the book is about them , their customs , and the awful fear and darkness they lived in don richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin , and longing for release the horror of their pain is graphic , and not suitable to be read to younger children
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking , which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it , i read it as a novel , for entertainment years later , i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading , i was able to examine the russian names , characters , events , and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog , which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going , which it certainly is , but in it , tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence , each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space , with one atom colliding at random with another , but when a sufficient number act in concert , such as napoleon 's invasion of russia , their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar , he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom , who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self deluding as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms , then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature this one tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one or any other deity , but he does say that history , time , and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path , and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go , then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov , who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going
add this reviewer to the list of people who hold paradise lost up to the lofty title of the greatest epic poem in the english language it is not only this , but one of the best in any language writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed homeric epic verse , mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by homer , virgil , and dante but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work the opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by homer , as are other elements , but milton has a very unique poetic style long sentences , often with the principle verb at the end , being one of its mainstays this language is very grandiose and quite complex it takes a while to get used to it you will have to pay very close attention during the first book but , as with most classical literature , once the reader gets the hang of it , it goes quite smoothly the divine comedy of dante has a more towring reputation than does milton 's paradise lost for one thing , it is older but i among those who find milton to be superior the divine comedy is , certainly , an undisputed masterpiece , but , where it was , more or less , a satire and a thinly veiled attack on many of dante 's political enemies , milton 's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter why mankind fell , how the gods themselves operate and think , the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin , the importance of love in human relationships , the moral problems of god 's justice it is true that dante 's work is more original paradise lost and paradise regained , at least in seed , come straight from the bible but milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective strictly within the christian tradition , to be sure , but far from fundamentalist , and even quite radical for its day although some cite the work as christian apologist , there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard line christians would be taken aback by it was , of course , even more controversial in its day one thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than god this , in my view , does not have milton unwittingly on the devil 's side , as some critics have suggested rather , he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is of course it 's interesting , of course it 's appealing otherwise , we would n't keep falling for it again and again and again if we saw its razor sharp fangs and dripping mouth , we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago however , as a non christian myself , i cannot but disagree with some points of milton 's theodicy the last two books , in particular , and paradise regained as a whole , were , for me , quite hard to swallow i found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing milton paints adam and eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share joy , happiness , fear , sadness , depression , and , most of all , the overriding paramount importance of love the act of adam , who was not himself evil , eating of the apple so that he could follow eve , no matter what doom was to befall her and them , out of love for her , is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature as mark twain , in the voice of adam , later said , wheresoever eve was there , there was eden god , satan , and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics most christians today seem to have forgotten that god created man in his own image , and that he is not a perfect creature likewise , satan is not entirely evil certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic , but so are many humans indeed , many have seen him as the hero of the poem \( an errorenous view , as i see it \) god often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful indeed , to many readers , myself included , this poem does n't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of gods to men , but only reinforces the views we already had \( mark twain , whom i have previously mentioned , has a very different view of the situation , closer to my own perspective , that is worth seeking out \) whatever one 's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem , the poem remains a great work of literature poetic , grandiose , profound , extremely readable , and thought provoking the shorter sequel , paradise regained , is also included in this edition this work , in my view , comes nowhere near the glory of it 's predecessor , but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well for that reason , i highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works also because the introduction , written by dr susanne woods , is very good , and it has notes provided by the wonderful christoper ricks , who also edited the poem for this version unlike many editors , he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them this is an absolute classic not only of english literature , but of world literature , and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read
for someone totally unfamiliar with authorware , i thought this book rather confusing i typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises however , i knew authorware was pretty complex so i thought this book would help well , it did help a little but overall i became quite frustrated with following the book 's exercises as i use authorware i imagine i 'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool but until then , i 'll content myself with playing on my own
patton describes qualitative research design and data collection methods in a way that even the novice researcher can easily understand and utilize
i bought this cookbook due to the introductory price i received and have loved every recipe i have tried many of the recipies are heart healthy and i have found those to be tasty and easy to prepare good luck and good cooking
harvey is a totally spoiled boy it starts when harvey is on a ship with his mother \( i forget where they are going \) he is washed overboard , and saved by a fisherman `manuel ' on the fishing boat harvey makes his first friend , learns to work for his keep and so on the story worked , it was n't cheesy , maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type , but the plot of harvey growing up seemed just to be there so you will read the book the characters were well developed except the cook , you never really figure out where he is coming from most of the book was about fishing of the grand banks , very interesting is you like fishing and ships , but if you are reading it for the story , there is not that much , the ending was also weak , we are happy the harvey is reconciled , but i really think that his parents would make a bigger stink good historical value , kipling is a very enjoyable writer , yes i liked it but the plot had some flaws i do recommend it though
i loaned my copy of dr streicher 's book to my mother who thought she may need a hysterectomy my mother reported that dr streicher 's book had information on topics she could n't find elsewhere even about laparoscopic procedures which she had n't heard about before dr streicher 's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor fortunately , it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy my only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother i may need to purchase a new one i think it is a must have for any woman 40 even for men whose partners spouses girlfriends are facing this
i was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and i found it surprisingly helpful by filling out a basic personality inventory , this book will tell you what style of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other styles i see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday but i can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment if you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior , this book gives you the skills to build great relationships i agree , however , with the previous reviewer 's comments that this book does not go very deep , thus only 4 stars do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this , but you can make your day to day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics \( this is also an easy read took me 2 days !
this book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago i own and have read about twelve books on the topic out of all of them , this has been by far the best by the end it feels like a journey inside yourself has taken place and you arrive to a new destination on your insides the feel of the book is one of love and support not the self centered type , or author as guru type that i have read in other books this one has the experience of two professional therapists that shows itself in each chapter it made a large difference in my struggle with an eating disorder that started at age 10 i am now 44
classic book is great in dribble proof format with good reproductions of the original illustrations lots of squirming and hugging while reading this one
tapscott and ticoll have written another very detailed , practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely at the heart of the naked corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster , which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge in other words , perhaps the old adage there 's one born every minute needs updating they 're still being born , but hopefully now only a few per hour \? corporations getting naked ca n't be good news for marketing departments their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image companies and products must be the image for real yikes david brett , founder , knexa
i read this book , loved it , and now want to make a movie of it there is a local town that has a college , churches , and the overall atmosphere of the town i felt like i was reading about it while i was going through the book
i bought this book to learn some simple things to fold in a kindergarten i used to work in , and it was an instant success ! i was sat at the table for hours folding frogs and boats to the kids , and they seemed to really enjoy the creations ! this is a great book for parents and pre school teachers , and it is a great way to learn a little bit about geometry too some of the models are difficult to understand , but folding is about taking your time a great way of finding a corner of peace in our rush hour lifestyle
whitman is not the world 's greatest poet that 's probably shakespeare but he 's certainly been the most influential american poetic voice over the past century he was the first poet to take all of american life as his subject ever the romantic , whitman was also the first poet to bring romanticism into line with everyday reality
i have been an information systems professional for several years now and i am happy to see that there is finally a focus on data as the asset it truly is if i could put certified data on the balance sheet as a separate line item , i would i have been reading your book improving data warehouse and business information quality over the past several weeks and i have this ear to ear grin that some peers find disturbing \( why does he get so excited about data \? \) high quality data success
os guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply this book is no exception the fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section
this book brings some of the items one read about in history classes to a more 'back channel' perspective monroe doctrine and the like are the opening situations , and instead of 'we put a blockade on german ship' it goes it to some of the things that happened to stop a war from breaking out
i grew up reading and rereading this book , as did all the five children in my family it 's one of the very funniest books i know on the subject of families and their foibles shirley jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when i recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor once you read this you must also read raising demons , which is the sequel , and every bit as good , although much harder to find
read on if you are

for most of us , the area of thanatology is something quite new , despite the fact that death is such an intimate companion that can come at any moment of our lives , whether by degrees or instantaneously , irrelevant of our ethnic , social and economic backgrounds it is a plain truth that can not be avoided , and no technological advancements can make it go away i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you , despite what your feelings may be and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier , the adult must equally do so with death , not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means the total cessation of physical life , for if one denys its existence and its inevitability , the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache , but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental , spiritual and religious grief as well submission to and acceptance of the truth , no matter how difficult it would be to hear , could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing in elizabeth kubler ross 's classic study of the dying process , she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person , the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all hence , how do you take the sting from the wound \? in on death and dying , you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say , to let them vent , and at their own pace , go through the classic defined stages of the dying process denial and isolation , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance the patients become our teachers we learn of their fears , their possible financial burdens , in one woman 's case , the fear of the worms , et cetera but we also learn about what the families go through , their own anger and disbelief and guilt it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger , other times not the united states is one of the most death denying countries out there , a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process , for going foward means only one thing death ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is , the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe death has issues for everybody , doctors , faith filled people , even ross heself it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together
i enjoyed robert webber 's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well at a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the fate of the church in america so much commodification has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be ecclesia \? although i agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church \( the lutheran church missouri synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy the church body which webber received his doctorate from \) , my question is are we truly called to change the church in order to meet the people where they are at \?
i find it difficult to rate and review parenting books with such specific agendas , such as the continuum concept i fear that alone this book would render a nervous , new mother terrified of failure ! i am wary of books that pretend there is only one way to raise every child that said , i adore text that encourages instinctual , intuitive parenting coupled with the dozens of other parenting guides i have read \( from all spectrums \) , the continuum concept is a very valuable book
it is quite rare that a book appears that is this good but this book is so good that even men \( i am male \) can \( i e should \) enjoy it a groundbreaking , unabashedly feminist \( wo \) manifesto , the vagina monologues has given voice to countless women in the past ten years , and has ushered in a new era of sexual liberation if you are still incredulous , ask yourself how many books published hitherto so much as had the word 'vagina' , let alone all the facts thereabout in it \? a wonderful book
for those who love historical texts , but sometimes have a hard time weeding thru the period language , overly technical jargon and miles of microfiche , this book is a real blessing the author not only deals with the methods of tracking , chasing and boarding prey , but goes happily in depth about the people who follow the sweet trade he covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea , the events leading up to their rise in influence in the caribbean , and goes into clothing , food , religion , heirarchy , weapons , flags , choice of ships and cultural relationships
with the hype over the da vinci code and its related popularity , you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with dan brown of course , this is not the case , as brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers probably the biggest in the bunch was robert ludlum , but not to be forgotten is jon land not quite the big name that ludlum or brown , land is nonetheless the most pure fun , with outlandish plots and tons of action
i made 4 dishes from the book for my girlfriends and all of the recipes were a huge hit the carmelized onion and spinach dip was amazing as well as the tomato and ginger soup i especially like the 'buy and arrange' features which give you clever stylish ideas for easy dishes to throw together if you do n't have alot of time no more 3 course meals for me , i'm going all appetizers
note to reviewers the title of the book was a play on hillary claiming that there was a vast right wing conspiracy against her husband in the monica scandal she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy \( right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything \)
devoted entirely to coming to amazon to trash conservative books \? i see the same names here i saw for kate o'bierne 's book , tony blankley 's book , michelle malkin 's books , david limbaugh 's books you get the idea and most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing , too you 'd think some of you would aim for creativity , especially when you 're accusing republicans of being mindless automatons
a moving and inspiring portrait of men most people will never know about but will always be remembered by those touched by their deeds and courage in places we do n't remember much anymore i am thankful for the sacrifice they made so i could freely write this
since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story \( huge lawsuit against a hospital suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor \) i 'll simply leave a brief comment although the story is n't all that complicated , it was still a quick , enjoyable read and the ending was one i did n't see coming please be aware , though , that the 5th horseman is not an alex cross novel , which seemed to be one reviewer 's complaint this is the story of lindsay boxer , sfpd lieutenant and her fellow women 's murder club friends i found the story to be heartfelt and emotional , full of action adventure , and , as i said , a very quick , satisfying read

as a parent , child and family therapist and school counselor i have seen positive discipline concepts change the lives of parents and children alike we are all searching for a way to raise our children that allows them to develop the long term life skills of confidence , responsibility , contribution and the ability to solve problems the schools that teach these skills in addition to academics have students that perform better in school and in life using positive discipline will actually save you time in the classroom , and make your job and relationships with your students much more enjoyable

i have long been aware of the commercial success of author nora roberts but the storylines and writing style \( a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance \) have never tempted me to read any of her work however , i happened to pick up a copy of volume 21 \( depending on how you count anthology inclusions \) in the in death series written under the pen name j d robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series \( the year is 2058 \) with a strong central character \( detective lieutenant eve dallas \) who had a continuing romantic interest \( the mysterious irish billionaire roarke \) i have long enjoyed the spenser series by robert parker and the ensemble cast of ed mcbain 's 87th precinct novels the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of new york city , an area very familiar to me i was immediately hooked by survivor in death and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review \( 3 30 2005 \) i read origin in death , the next book in the series , as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well \( 7 26 2005 \) as with other series which i have enjoyed , i then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved
this is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself this makes it a largely indispensable supplement , handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism this is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated , and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear the reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as renan , max weber and stalin \( although the views of marx and engels themselves or lord acton and friedrich meinecke would have been welcome additions \) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars \( gellner , anderson , connor , a smith , etc \) the texts are well selected and organized , and it really contributes to making a very complex subject and a daunting field of scholarship seem a little easier to grasp
if you are just starting out on photography , i highly recommend this book it begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making ! for this reason alone , i would give it 5 stars here in the first chapter , the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures the photographer , not the equipment they then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures \( at least , the rest of us non professionals \) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high tech cameras
if you are ready to take complete responsibility for yourself and live the joyful life then this is a must read i will say it is simple even thou i will avoid saying it is easy for your sake and your loved ones sake give this idea a go

this story , set early in the known space period , is an important part of larry niven 's future universe , full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science the protectors do n't fit quite comfortably into the known space universe , and have raised some problems later , for example in the famous man kzin wars , where the known space universe has been shared by other writers , including poul anderson , jerry pournelle , sm stirling and hal colebatch , but the story is fine space opera and entertainment , and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary sf
i picked up this book looking at the cover trying to figure out his picture i then looked at the titleee and it clicked i read this for school and it was n't hard to finish it because it amazed me with what everything really was usually i read fiction books that have diseases or disorders in them i figured that there should be some explaination for me it wasnt hard to follow also everything was explained very well i did n't have any real background other than the fictions books that you really could n't go by
after viewing the german artistic mini series for television many years ago , i decided to read this german family story to rival galsworthy 's forsythe saga i was not disappointed , because this book deals , among others , with one essential aspect of human existence man 's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status the story of the buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who , although belong to the same family , can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality in this family we see characters who are able to adapt , understand the world and compromise , while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self abandon this fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature , two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings it is for this reason that buddenbrooks is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life , a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil
alan lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities as a result , he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science , especially physics none of the essays are ultra profound , but they 're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading , especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited this book reminds me of feynman 's rainbow by leonard mlodinow , which i also found to be very enjoyable and , like mlodinow 's book , lightman 's book is a quick read
it may sound as though i am damning this book with faint praise , but i believe that with a subject as complicated as anti western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener
okay , the title is a bit much but i enjoyed this book tremendously some of the criticisms point to the elements i liked best the routine cases , how they were approached , and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what i 've seen on cops \( constant action and crisis ! \) there was a new story on every page , and i wound up reading until 1 a m on a work day because i just could n't help reading one more page the descriptions of the surroundings , the characters , the sounds and smells of the settings , conjured up a real sense of being there i was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book , as atkinson tried to remain true to mccain 's philosophy that most people are n't entirely good or bad as a resident of the area , i finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when i was growing up \( i remember the old boston record american newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front \) i highly recommend this book to anyone who lives in the northeast , and to others who 'd like a glimpse into how boston politics are practiced in every profession
i could n't help myself when i opened the juicing bible i should have been doing other things but i spent over an hour perusing the pages it contains a wealth of information on fruits , herbs , and vegetables and their healing properties the layout is handy and it is easy to find things with the detailed indices the recipes are simple , clearly written , and sound delicious i am excited and inspired in fact , i'm going to get my juicer off of the bottom shelf of the pantry and go for it

michael farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history loving set this one , treasury of deception , is just what it 's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds , from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes , such as the blood libel it is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites , although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once the book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and , amazingly enough , never veers into the truly silly , which is a blessing
this was an amazing book it was one of those where when you read it , you can picture the story in your head , almost movie like feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement this was my first fiest book , but i can guarantee you , it wont be my last
i think nora roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms , as we 've seen in her books irish thoroughbred , irish rebel and now true betrayals which was written in 1996 unlike the other two , true betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres to me , it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours

i was recommended this book after having taken a body electric workshop a few weeks before from the first page i began to re live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend how to connect , how to communicate , and how to intimately bond on a higher plane ! although some of the prose is repetitive , it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from a definite must have book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally

i always look to see if an author stands in their truth if they walk their talk dr christiane northrup does i have read all of her books , women 's bodies , women 's wisdom , the wisdom of menopause and now mother daughter wisdom they all embody her path to well being and her knowledge on the subject of women 's health in her book mother daughter wisdom , she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness i find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother daughter relationship i have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up i found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters dr northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship she addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way she talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter this book is also a reference book as dr northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter 's life mothers , men , and women without children , would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter
as the authors state in the preface of the book , the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts this is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract , but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions , then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate
this book is a must have for anyone applying six sigma to real world problems not only do i use it on a nearly daily basis , i'm finding that my engineers are embracing the terminology and concepts so clearly conveyed in this text we 're spending 20 minutes at each staff meeting to review topics from basic statistics to advanced application of teaming concepts to get results instead of the usual soft stuff application examples that seem to illustrate that the author thinks everyone 's making clothes pins , pyzdek 's book shows that he 's really lived this stuff i highly recommend this book to anyone serious about applying six sigma for results
this book is an almost encylocpedic digest of current theories of thoroughbred handicapping none are covered in such detail that you can run off and start making money at the track , but each points you to a source for more comprehensive information on the theory that interests you

this is a very involved book , bringing to light all the past and present characters i loved it it was nice to see the history of o'connor and his mentor jack i thought ms burke pulled this one off nicely with the mystery being spread over a 40 yr timeframe nice job it was nice to see new characters introduced also , i hope to see them in future books if you have n't read this series , you could probably get away with starting out with this book i have to tell you though that you are missing a lot by not reading all of the other books in the irene kelly series
once again , david mccullough 's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind this biography reads like a fascinating novel , and mcculloughs narrative ability is unmatched no one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can
i religiously read all of baldacci 's books he ca n't write them fast enough for me and this is one of his best ! i 'd give it 10 stars if i could

i am an inveterate map reader whenever i travel there is a map in my pocket but a recent trip to the middle east and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as i tried to put in context the ruins visited and the coins i collected with time , the names of cities and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period morkot 's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps , but the rationale and context for their evolution and change one of the best features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview , followed by a series of in depth accounts , each from the perspective of the important players during a given historical period this approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the same information is repeated and new information added as each of the regions , their politics and battles , are succesively presented from the mycenae to the parthians are thousands of years , thousands of miles , and thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of influence affect us even today for the first time after years of puzzling over strange grecian place names and leaders , i am now able to begin to understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the birth of christ i wish this had been the first book i read in my study of ancient history i can hardly wait to start on penguin 's sequel acient rome

this book is full of useful insights i was fortunate to hear reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals while some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic , i doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business i applied his methodology to my business \( direct selling \) and had over 6 , 000 interviews completed to identify promoters , passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors consistent with reichheld 's findings , the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics from the detailed findings , we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business buy the book have an open mind apply the concepts he has laid out if you do , you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
this series of books is a beast that has possessed me with its great storylines , characters and cliffhanger endings kudoes to lahaye

truman capote 's wrote the grass harp early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem this sweet , eccentric , moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared , closeness is established , and love blooms think flannery o'connor meets swiss family robinson with a dash of steel magnolias themes of finding one 's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative it has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth primary assets are the thick as molasses southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters
the big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex few of us ever wake up to the mental prison cells that society has put us in and fewer still escape anne lamott 's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating once you get past this junk , you begin to see you do n't really need books telling you how to write at all you just need to write
this is my favorite kid 's book and i 've read a lot of books to my four year old ! the illustrations are simply wonderful and the story is great it just begs you to use funny voices as you read i buy it as a gift for every birthday party

of all the articles and books of chomsky that i have read , necessary illusions thought control in democratic societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched \( and footnoted \) , the most logically structured , and the most convincing chomsky reminds us that the majority of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their information about political affairs both domestic and foreign one can only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic so take , for example , the popular myth of the 'persistent soviet vetoe' at the un during the cold war why do people believe the ussr was constantly vetoeing any and every security council resolution \? simple ! when they did , it generated front page condemnation when the us or the uk exercised their right of veteo silence as chomsky notes , during the years of 1970 and 1989 the former soviet union veteod 8 resolutions the us veteod some 56 this is what chomsky refers to as thought control unless the public examine the factual record of the un themselves , they will never come by this information , \( at least not in the mainstream press \) so although chomsky 's title may appear somewhat paradoxical , or oxymoronic , a moments reflection on such facts shows it to be , in fact , extremenly pragmatic and truthful the question is , have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs \? the crux of chomsky 's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship chomsky points out that , in fact , propaganda is , contrary to popular postulations , more important and vital to a democratic society because people still have some rights that is , since people can talk , the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words come out of the peoples' mouths in a dictatorship it does not really matter too much what people think for whatever they may think , they have to do what they are told , by pain of death in countries such as the us \( and the uk \) other , more subtle , methods are required people often critisise chomsky for the sources of his information \( the copious footnotes \) no such critique can be levelled at this work chomsky 's sources are declassified internal planning documents , naval proceedings documents , and the very institutions he examines , new york times , washington post etc if there was one chomsky book i would suggest you to read , this would be it

pat was right ! anyone read the news lately \? bush has succeeded only in creating more terrorists mission accomplished buchanan may have some whacky views about illegal aliens , but he knows his foreign policy when it comes to warfare and economics if he and ralph nader did n't dislike eachother so much they would no doubt make the best running mates this country has seen in half a century

if you liked empire , you 'll love multitude the authors and reviewers alike speak of multitude as a follow up to empire , but i think something very different is happening here hardt and negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory , and in multitude they have attained a height depth of perception well beyond empire if you are attempting to learn your radicalism , or inform your progressivism , through hardt and negri , then you may see multitude as continuing from and expanding empire , and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books but what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book where empire was the best try we had at the time , multitude now succeeds where the digression in empire circled around the feeling of our world cultural hematopoiesis , the discursion in multitude captures it

this book was like madonna 's famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960 's this is brown 's manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era reader beware choices and actions have consequence and ponder very carefully before being cosmopolitan long after the expiration date living it up does not mean reckless behavior values are personal but when one woman 's values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another \( ie affairs with married men \) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others' heads people are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them although now dated and updated with sex and the city ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right helen gurley brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers , enjouing the single life , and having an identity but too much too long has a cost do you really want to be like brown and her counterpart hefner 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth \?

before the epiricist philosophers came along , it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning thus , complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic , working off what was assumed to be true then hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories relations of ideas and matters of fact relations of ideas are things that a true by defintion 2 2 will always equal 4 , because that is how it is defined try as we might , we can never successfully imagine 2 2 equalling 5 so relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world they are definitions we use to describe what is happening matters of fact , on the other hand , are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world , such as the sun will rise tomorrow morning unlike with relations of ideas , matters of fact are not true my their defintition we can imagine successfully the sun will not rise tomorrow how , then , if we can imagine the supposed impossible , do we know anything to be truly impossible \? hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry he effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true it was n't until kant 's critique of pure reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of hume 's metaphysics this is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers

i really enjoyed this book from beginning to end there are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share i am glad this story was n't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate for the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new it is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she 's lost i could read this novel over and over the deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage 's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail

we are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible ! without existing virtual technologies , compiling a complete collection of the new yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations , availability , and of course the daunting financial investment for the price of a modest concert , eighty years of intelligent discourse , satire , observation and fiction are all available i have nothing negative to say about this it does what it promises and does it well it still amazes me that i now have every issue of the new yorker , and look forward to the continuation of this extraordinary trend of publications releasing the entirety of their output

this is a must read book not just once , but many times each time you read it you understand and see a different view of the book one needs to read this book from the heart as the meaning of kokoro means from the heart the story of a married man , yet lonely why he feels guilty about the death of his best friend a scholar with no ambition , rich enough to enjoy a few simple things in life how he talks about the ending of his own life he is sure his wife will be taken care of after his death the student is confused i am confused read the book more than once each time you read , put yourself in each characters shoe written with passion , kokoro , from the heart is this book fiction or non fiction , you decide
jesse stone is sort of spenser 's alter ego he 's younger , and spenser 's never had a drinking problem , but other than that , they 're pretty much the same character , except stone 's about thirty years younger robert b parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now this is the fourth stone novel , there are 31 spenser novels , three featuring his third character , sunny randall , and nine books that are n't part of a series , some of them non fiction that 's 47 books , for those who are n't keeping up with the math obviously , by now parker knows what he 's doing he seems able to write one of these every six months or so he alternates between randall , spenser , and stone with ease , and just floats along
jane hirshfield and mariko aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity i had a friend who was a japanese scholar , who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka i have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called on japanese poetry and the process of translation i recommend it highly , even if you do not normally read this kind of essay
before reading this book , i 'd had a much more black and white \( sc , mostly black \) impression of jewish life in medieval and early modern europe this cogently writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture ghetto walls were an injustice , but also a refuge for many jews from the tense environment around them oddly enough , this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to christianity in the liberal west after the napoleonic liberations \( in contrast to the shtetl jews in poland and russia , who lived side by side with gentile neighbors \) katz 's discussions of of jewish martyrs during the first crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa , among other topics , are also quite fascinating
this is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject what happens at death , or near death \? it is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor and , in spite of the fact that i am a christian , with conservative beliefs , and even though i maintain my faith carefully focused on god , i do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence \( along with its companion , written subsequently , life beyond death \) i invite you to read it and see why
i actually enjoyed this book very much i was in a romance slump and needed something different well , i got it
h g wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent , world dominating british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way , particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world \( read colonize \) for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that attitude on a pedestal , and although he did n't knock it down , he made his point and in spectacular fashion in one way , the martians were the conquering british , with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the british despite their firm belief in their world destiny could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british \( or anyone else 's \) false boast of superiority in the end , though , it 's a hopeful book just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world , wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british \( alien \) way was not the native way of life in the colonies , suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that , it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense
this is the stupidest review i have read so far on this site the person who wrote it has no idea what they are talking about i seriously doubt they even considered reading the book \( i have n't but i 've been poor and i 've been on welfare \)
i just finished reading the hitorian the first 400 pages were so compelling , that i could hardly put it down then it became soooo boring it literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400 i just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head , thinking this has to get better , considering how good the first 2 3rd 's were
wendell jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat the verdict was suicide , but the insurance company that had sold him a half million dollar insurance policy is not convinced when 5 years passed , the company was forced to pay the premium to jaffe 's wife two months later , a man looking very much like jaffe is spotted in mexico the insurance company hires private investigator kinsey millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be jaffe , along with his girlfriend renata they escape kinsey 's surveillance and she returns to california jaffe 's son brian is in big trouble with the police and kinsey concludes that jaffe will return to help his son as she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with jaffe 's supposed widow and his two troubled sons she also comes in contact with some of her long lost family , and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them , and open up old wounds sue grafton can be relied on to provide a good read , and this book , although not the best in the series , is no exception
this is one of nora roberts' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite i adore this book the characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex husband what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances \( including roberts \) definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
as usual , robin cook keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end
i started the book last night , and could n't put it down until 4 am , but at least i finished it ! it was a good storyline , i enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world it also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general i really liked the characters in this book , although each one , in my opinion , could have used some more depth the only reason this book does n't get 5 stars is because as you read it you start to feel that the second half of the book lt with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book gt was completely rushed i really do n't like a sudden closing to a book however , it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages i just feel that it could have had more of an impact , and more of that umph had the story been written at the same speed throughout i do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read if you 're looking for something you will remember for life this is n't going to be it but if you 're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon by all means , try reading mary jane clark 's do you etc final word i believe her mother in law , the other clark , would be quite proud of her ex daughter in law the woman can write however , given her talents , i wish she would learn to write in her own style , instead of in the familiar style of the other clark
truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever ! were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh , this is the best medicine
reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that foucault points to profit and capitalism with the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than 'off with their head' or hands the panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like carnegie and rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by gps , social security cards , public schooling \( founded by the same industrial giants \) intellectual and psychological grading , job placement and conformity , credit ratings , licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom , a growing snitch culture foucault 's major thesis is that surveillance \( discipline \) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance as industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly every facet of modern society works to this end the irony is , as techno pundits like mccluhan later pointed out , in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order , where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication everything that stands in the way of the profit order , whether it be an idea , person , religion , or country is attacked bottom line , we are all 'human resources' in the political economy , in the religion of capital packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else the inanity and inherent fraud of our system , not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society , makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like foucault of all his books this is also the easiest read this is a beautiful book by a complicated man by the way , he taught at the university of buffalo for a short time
when i thought there were not any more sex techniques i could learn from a book , this book just amazed me combined with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed , this book can make you a better lover , husband or sex partner for sure
hannah arendt 's the origins of totalitarianism is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century , soviet communism and nazism , and traces their historical roots the book is divided into three volumes focusing on antisemitism , imperialism , and totalitarianism the first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of antisemitism arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of antisemitism for example , some historians have argued based on a scapegoat theory that the jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world 's ills arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the jews arendt explores the rise of antisemitism in the birth of the nation state , the emancipation of the jews , the rise of the jewish financiers , the roles of jews within society , and the infamous dreyfus affair of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as benjamin disraeli or the infamous forgery the protocols of the elders of zion the idea that the jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of antisemitism the second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of imperialism here , a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as count arthur de gobineau and various forms of social darwinism the role of the boers in south africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as cecil rhodes , who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic nordic elite , is made the great pan movements , pan slavism , pan germanism , and the pan arabism of t e lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored the final volume of this book is concerned with totalitarianism proper here , the role of propaganda and the secret police , as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in nazi germany and soviet russia arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent written during the cold war period and just after the second world war , this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as adolf hitler and josef stalin their movements of nazism and soviet communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished the book is important today not only for historical reasons , but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world
i found airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation i was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary \( i e the media \) that being said , i was not the least disappointed
i love this book i have read this book in three different languages \( german , english and french \) it 's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids ! this book has a lot of great quotes like
this is not the book for you if you 're impatient with precision and specifics if you want good results , you 'll do what michael recchiuti tells you to do you 'll buy the higher butterfat butter , you 'll use the scharffen berger or valrhona and chuck the hershey 's , and you 'll be so glad you did , because every recipe and i mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes i have tried from this book thus far has been fantastic
for those who have not read volume 1 , just get book 2 and get all the great information plus lots more being a born again christian , some of the dialogue is beyond my belief system , but just glean the book and keep the great stuff if your faith is well grounded , just look at this as a first class medical journal and forget the buddhist hogwash
if you 've been given this book , or recommended it by a friend then you 've been blessed this book is bizarre , yes , but if it finds its way to you i'm sure you wo n't be troubled by that minor detail thank you elisabeth haich , for this book it 's a gift i ca n't possibly explain in words the effect this book had on my life , nevermind fathom how the author used words to discuss topics which have traditionally defied discussion i still ca n't believe that this book actually exists , but i'm eternally thankful it does
ms roddick has managed to put together some important issues , outstanding commentators , and good information design in one place with this book i read it through from cover to cover \( i seldom do this \) and found myself both enlightened and inspired i recommend it highly
i 've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title , and i must strongly disagree malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches i have found to date in place of the term advanced in the title , a better word would be comprehensive nonetheless , malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight
i am from yazoo city so this book has always been one of my favorites i saw willie morris at a car wash in jackson , ms not long before his death i was shy and did n't want to bother him , so i did n't introduce myself and have a chat i would have loved to have spoken with him now i regret my shyness should 've taken the chance yazoo city has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories no matter where i live , it will always be home there is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever i drive into the city limits it is a feeling of home not many people have that sense of home these days i feel blessed to have grown up there
this play was amazing ! i am not a reader , and i could n't put it down i recommend this play for any actor it will stretch your mind and acting abilities

a great reference book to have for any designer , although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject i would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things typographical
just when you thought you 've heard all larry has to offer it gets way better i 've only just started reading it the past 2 days , but i have to say it i don't care who you are that's funy right there ! ! ! ! !
this book was referred to me by one of the author 's students i have been practicing karuna reiki for several years i was thrilled to read this book the author has introduced many specific healing techniques and symbol combinations that have produced amazing results for my clients she obviously has an incredible passion for karuna reiki because the book reads as if the energy itself wrote every word

what fun ! this hilarious book is filled with
this is n't really a novel and it is n't really a collection of short stories , but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time , as he imagines einstein envisioned them each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time time is money , time flows uphill , live in the present forget the past , time is motion , etc
it 's been a while since i 've read one of janet evanovich 's stephanie plum novels , but a sudden need for light reading found ten big ones at the book store plum 's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after joe morelli or ranger , how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station , and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed definitely light fare , even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic he not only wants stephanie dead , but he also wants her end to be spectacular
i 've long been a fan of borges the short fiction writer but this little book has made me an instant fan of borges the reader and borges the literary critic i have to admit that so much of petry mystifies me , but within the pages of this book , i felt as if borges' insight was finally allowing me to understand poetry in a way i had n't considered before witty , modest and polymathic , borges shines through the pages of this book you can read it in an hour , but if you read it for 1 week straight , you still would n't be able to appreciate all the gems of wisdom in it great stuff
i enjoyed this book it focuses mainly on franklin 's time abroad in england and france and gives an overview on who franklin was and how he interacted on the world stage during the revolutionary period i believe it 's very accessible and would be a good starting place for anyone interested in franklin 's life he 's funny
all right all right , i say so i'm writing about a preteen book about a little girl that does n't make me weird does it \? it should n't since i had to read it for a college course so i'm writing because , well , who would 've ever guessed , but i loved it \? it 's a ripping story , man it is funny , inventive , historic and riveting , all the things i was sure it would n't be when i got assigned the book so , here i am , blown away by a book about a little girl i do n't even like history , but it was n't presented as antiquated it was dealt with as you and i would deal with our history , as pertinent , in the moment , and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book i'm telling you , the character darby is great , as are all the characters , including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon , etc , until darby unintentionally questions everything , causing all matter of problems , like maybe she 'll get knocked off by the klan the story is actually something you 'll find yourself absolutely focused on i could n't put it down i 've read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class , and i can say that if i had a kid , i 'd be pouring this down their brain so , does that make me weird \? who cares , huh \? i had to read the book for my class , and i'm happy i did
i decided to read this book because i enjoyed dr o'connor 's book , undoing depression so much i am delighted to report that undoing perpetual stress is an even better book
when i saw the cover of this book , i had a feeling i would love it the picture of the little boy on the cover flexing his muscles is something i have seen my three sons do many , many times when i opened it and started to read , wonderful memories flooded back of when my sons were younger i laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories
few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece this is one of them
i too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as i wanted this is a perfect metaphor for the book when all you 've ever wanted is n't enough the book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside , that always seems to want something more until they arrive at that something more , people can never truly feel content
this is da book on the dick van dyke show , but it 's really far more than that it is the finest book on a tv sitcom i 've ever come across waldron painstakingly discusses everything you 'd ever want to know about the show , and he interviewed \( seemingly \) everyone connected with the show , including carl reiner , mary tyler moore , dick , larry matthews , rose marie , and many of the writers if you 're a dvds fan , you 've gottta have this tome on hand i ca n't recommend it highly enough i fervently hope vince will do subsequent books on cheers and other sitcoms he 's the only man for the job
i purchased this book after having seen super size me and i was a little worried that there would be nothing new for morgan to present i , however , was proven wrong this is a very good read that is able to put down more statistics and specifics about the food industry that the movie was not as focuses on the movie , of course , was focused mostly on the fast food industry
the nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the outsider 's incorrect perceptions or the insider 's preconceptions , depending on which is constructing the definition what we find with w j cash 's the mind of the south is no different , although it is a pleasant journey sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing , cash 's work deserves recognition for this reason alone yet there is value in the exposition itself , even if it forgets a full two thirds of the south 's population in its description \( blacks and women \) what the modern reader is left with , then , is not so much a description of the the southern mind as it is the white southern male mind and while cash 's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind , it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the american south , with a small dash of glory added for good measure
this is another collection of barry 's columns and a surefire hit for any fan as usual , his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke mr language person makes an appearance or two in this collection , and barry also takes on tv commericials , his relationship with his wife , and \( always a winner \) the life of his teenaged son recommended
while i agree with several people who do n't consider this chick lit , i do n't see why that is a bad thing i enjoyed radish 's writing style , purple prose and all if you 're expecting a dickensian journey into a complex character , this book is not it however , it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life
kudos to finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter the fact that he himself , a descendent of holocaust survivors , has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points you cannot criticize the state of israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti semite any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless un resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism by far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the swiss banks this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work hilberg 's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight , and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi volume set the destruction of european jews would be well served to check it out
not only was the book cheaper on amazon than the bookstores but i ordered this book for my boyfriend from here and i got it earlier than expected so that was great ! he says it has great step by step images and that 's a positive for him since he learns more from visuals also , it has instructions that he 's able to follow and understand
we have enjoyed another of eric carle 's books brown bear brown bear what do you see since my son was a few weeks old so , when my son was about 7 months old , i bought from head to toe it was a wonderful purchase ! after a few reads , my son was imitating the animals just like his mama waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat it was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books i read to him

if you are a runner , you may have experienced the mental benefits that running provides you may have also felt a spiritual presence while running , perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail in this extraordinary book , joslin explores this mind body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport he shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal the book is well thought out and written with a great deal of humility and care this is one that i will read again and again it changed the way i approach running i also think about this book throughout the day , even when i am not running a great book
i am a total addict of leslie sansone 's walk away programs i had many exercise videos , but never stuck to anything until i found her energizing , fun , and most of all easy workouts
to think about racism is to be thoughtful to be thoughtful is to be engaged in the process of learning to refuse to reflect on and examine your belief systems is to be ignorant
this book was originally published ca 1980 as england and always i have not seen the original so i ca n't tell how much of this book is new material \( beyond a chapter dealing with peter jackson 's films \) lobdell has examined tolkien 's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives one of the most interesting deals with the influence of edwardian adventure fiction \( haggard , etc \) on tolkien another fascinating chapter deals with middle earth as a christian world in a pre christian age there is also a short fiction story in an appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to tolkien 's own abandoned sequel to the lord of the rings , the return of the shadow i enjoyed this story , though of course lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to tolkien \( but then , no one can ! \)
the watercolors are beautiful , but more amazing than that is the way the stories are told zen shorts has really caught my kids even my youngest , \( 7 years \) who is drawn to all things panda , is requesting the stories again and again because they make her wonder there are some wonderful kid 's books out there , but this is something special
this is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened it does not deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse \( the author explicitly states this on many occasions \) and the reviewer who suggested that this is a terrific book if you are child molester probably \( i guess \) did n't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy
masterfully thought out written not your usual supernatural , horror king story written in 4 5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural , but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood , follows them through the years culminates with them as adults each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in at the end they are all tied together in some ways years later it 's ingenious in it 's finale and i advise you set aside some time for reading it 's very difficult to put down once it grabs your interest , it just sucks you into the story if you remember your childhood friends \( we all do \) you 'll identify with the story
phyllis chesler is a most unusual feminist she really does n't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority , gender feminist crowd the one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth this seems to be her most pervasive \( and endearing \) feature as an intellectual , and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent death of feminism release here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text on the whole , it makes for compelling reading we find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else they have many of the same , yet subtlety different , characteristics as do men in these pages , chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner many mother daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations why feminists would n't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me we should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy chesler never implies any inter sex superiority or inferiority , she is content to describe what is , and it 's great stuff indeed
i have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec

raskolnikov , an impovershed student in 19th century st petersburg , conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker he justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse the world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes after all , the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society the crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with raskolnikov 's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering almost every major character in the book is more likeable that raskolnikov
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
i had to read this book as an assignment for a seminary class on leadership i was sceptical that a children 's book about witches would be applicable to a master 's level college course my scepticism was unfounded this is a good , fun read but , more than that , this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it 's characters i recommend it to children of all ages !
in faith in nation , anthony marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the literary trope \( p 15 \) about a liberal , inclusive western nationalism instead , he argues that even the truest brand of western nationalism that of england and france came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale his entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today this leads one to question why does he insist on such a position \? has he made the case for it \? what happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong \?
tony judt 's postwar a history of europe since 1945 is the well researched material from a british conservative born 1948 in london and educated at cambridge and paris on political , social and economic developments in europe following world war ii
as a pharmacy student , i found the washington manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options , as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories this is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment this book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state , but rather focuses on the causes , measurements and treatments my only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics , is considered old
this book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most u s citizens for so many years each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details , names and places of the participants this book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand why they hate us i only regret that their is not a sequel

i took the 2 tom cover 's classes in information theory at stanford last year we used this book as the text for both classes the first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones this book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory

in her latest book , tracey wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read

this book is a perfect trade off between simplified for dummies type writing that simply acquaints you with the subject matter and a comprehensive text that thoroughly covers the subject if you are a cpa hopeful , a governmental finance professional or a political science graduate student this is the text for you although layout and vocabulary could be simplified for improved readability , once you become familiar with the authors' style the reading is enjoyable
there was not a single poem i did n't like , and most of them i loved her poems seem to touch upon the core of things i feel comfortable with saying i think she is in the same league as mary oliver , hafiz , stafford , and rumi
in the last few decades historians following sociologists such as durkheim have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people 's experience of space and time schivelbusch 's small piece is a pretty good \( but light weight \) example of this genre he reveals some interesting trivia along the way he tells , for example , how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of first class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed he shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting social values of europe and america but he is at his most interesting when describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations furthermore , by creating the need for standardized time tables , railways nurtured a standardized homogenized conception of time local idiocyncracies became less important doubtless true national identities could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and communications a book that takes these ideas much further is stephen kern 's excellent work the culture of time and space if this genre interests you , kern 's book is an important read
this is my favorite of the series thus far without wanting to give too much away , this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why roland is willing to give up anything and everything \( and clearly has \) just to get to the dark tower king mentions that the dark tower series is sort of like his middle earth , where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world , and you see what he means with this book fan 's of the stand will recognize signs of the super flu within the first few hundred pages , and one of my all time favorite king villains comes back to pay his respects
i really like this book it was well written and enjoyable the characters in it were very interesting to read about i like the way that imogene and maxine stayed friends all the way through the book the two girls really seemed to bring out the best in each other maxine never thought imogene was crazy because of the strange things that happened maxine just believed her and helped her through everything overall it was a well written book with very good characters and it showed what friendship really is

immanuel kant is truly one of the most influential moral philosophers in history and with this book , groundwork of the metaphysics of morals , he positioned himself far further
said gives good insight into politics , especially in the middle east i did n't enjoy the literature section as much because i was n't familiar with the authors
hal zina bennett 's profound advice from his prolific writing career \( over 30 published books \) is , write from the heart as wonderful as that sounds , most writers know it 's not an easy thing to do hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader i can speak from my own personal experience , having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book , sacred woman , sacred dance awakening spirituality through movement and ritual write from the heart also offers practical guidance in several areas this includes such things as the need for solitude however , he is not just talking about having a quiet space , he goes beyond the physical to the inner a state of mind he says , once we know what it is , what it looks like and feels like , we can create it for ourselves , almost i say almost regardless of where we happen to be i would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
in light of rev falwell 's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of sept 11 , 2001 , i recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand , why would that guy say that stuff \? harding presents an objective , intelligent , perceptive analysis of the way that fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world , and how jerry falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active moral majority of the 1980s harding combs through falwell 's history and sermons to observe how the language of being born again affects the listener , showing falwell 's shift from separatism to political activism she critiques both falwell and falwell 's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way good reading and good understanding
i agree with the reviews already written i too got bogged down with trying to keep track of the names it is when i got to the end i found the listing of the people if i had known that earlier it would have reduced my mind confusion really enjoyed the way the book was written you felt their pain with out seeing their blood i better understand the explosion
kurt vonnegut 's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself his unique style of black humor , combined with his vivid imagination is second to none this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read ! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality is he , or is he not crazy \?
first off this is a history of hollywood not the history of hollywood david thomson is n't writing the chronological , straight up , blow by blow account of hollywood movies the whole equation is an essay that takes as its question , are hollywood films ever art like a beethoven symphony or a picasso painting \? he says they are both more and less than that more because american film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen that serendipity is wonderful when it works which is n't often less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits
i read any way the wind blows not a day goes by before i read abide with me if you happen to come into the series of e lynn 's books and want more of the scoop on basil 's problems with his past , raymond 's lifestyle , the true 'not so divafied' evil side of yancey and they 're mutual friends then you should start with this one ! it 'll help you put 'two two together' on the lives and backgrounds of all of the characters
underground education does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective , as is perhaps implied by the title but rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past some of the historical figures are famous , such as george washington and cleopatra while others , like the several female serial killers discussed , are more obscure the book is divided into 10 chapters , including the arts , religion , science and sex actually , this book reminds me somewhat of the people 's almanac series written by david wallechinsky but here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse it 's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge but some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover still it is a worthwhile purchase
national geographic magazine has long been recognized for the quality of its color photographs by its brilliant staff of photographers who manage to go to places both known and unknown and open vistas of other cultures , other peoples , other landscapes in this very large and exceptionally affordable volume are some of ng 's finest images plus many dazzling photographs not previously published in the magazine the result is a panorama of the world as few other books can supply
colonial fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology , critiques of orientalism that isolate gender and culture , and the western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm one of yegenoglu 's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process as desire frames the relation between the subject and its other , yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation as a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen , the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest , but simultaneously displaced her argumentation is lucid and compelling for the colonial gaze , the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire \( in the fantasy of unveiling \) as well as the bte noire , because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project the veil therefore frustrates the identity forming process of the subject object positioning in colonialist discourse the subject cannot quite see the object , and its subjectivity thus remains in question interestingly , this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by western feminism as the veil has come to signify the backwardness of islam and its inherent oppression of women , the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference in this dynamic , the identity of the liberated western woman is constructed vis vis the oppressed muslim woman \( 102 \) since the status of western women is contingent on the continued representation of muslim women as oppressed , yegenoglu reveals that the western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded enlightenment ideology she argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments \( 115 \) this facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles in sum , yegenoglu 's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post colonial theorists
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row , at least in the state of mississippi , and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however , some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain

fabulously entertaining novel from martin amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `information ' john self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials he is an alcoholic , a misogynist , and a microcosm of mainstream american culture in the 1980 's john has also landed a gig directing a feature film , titled `good money , ' and `bad money , ' depending on what day of the week it is amis' writing is mordantly brilliant both acerbic and biting there are transactions in here that i just love , such as john 's stinging interactions with his girlfriend selina

i think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously as political thrillers go , this is one of the best of the genre it 's packed with insider information , from power mad politicians and the amoral king makers who advise them , to nerves of steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the fbi granted the premise is implausible a group of former seals assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the seals believe have sold the country down the river \( or , in the southern vernacular , because they needed killin' \) while one can argue whether the seals have the high moral ground in this setting , it does n't detract from the page turning non stop action like a thrill ride at disneyland , this book should not be examined too critically just get in , hold on , close your eyes , and enjoy the ride
i ca n't say enough about this wonderful book it 's packed full of examples , covers more than just the pre adoption and placement aspects , and is incredibly non judgemental there 's so much information here , more than i expected it really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption it 's for both birth and adoptive parents , in fact , two of the birth parents we 've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption i'm so glad it was recommended to us if you 're thinking about adoption , even if you 're thinking that open adoption is n't right for you i highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book it 's great

william manchester , the greatest narrative historian of or time , provides a vivid account of his experiences in the pacific theatre during world war ii as with all of his books , we see , hear , smell , taste , and feel the experiences with him , as if we were there although more personal , of course , than his other narrative histories , goodbye darkness provides the same factual details , and each sentence , paragraph , and chapter is crafted with the same beauty and skill that is manchester 's hallmark an amazing memoir by a truly great writer

the waste lands , the third novel in stephen king 's the dark tower series is by far the best volume yet this volume picks up a short time after the end of drawing of the three , and we see roland training eddie and susannah to become true gunslingers in roland 's world soon into the novel , the three gunslingers encounter one the guardians of mid world , a huge cyborg bear , who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the dark tower by a beam , and if they follow the beam , it will lead them directly to the dark tower , they just do n't know how far away it is

the advice seems to be good advice to use in any relationship you also have to know your own situation very well and know when not to use his advice my ex would feel crowded if i sent her a bunch of sweet cards like the book says to do and would feel like i was trying to manipulate her , therefore i took it easy on the cards my ex may never get back with me because we are long distance but i feel i am loving her much better than before because of this book even if she does n't realize it remember to never tell your lover that you read this book , especially if he she is nervous about being manipulated
i'm glad i bought this book and i will continue to refer to it the remit of the dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss the text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science in this respect it would have been a difficult book to author , readers having come from one discipline or the other i agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree bioinformatics is a new field , and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler
i wo n't spoil the ending , but some many other reviewers did n't like the twist however , the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100 happy should read runaway jury however , like the firm \( another great book \) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble , this book has a very realistic ending that you did n't expect this was my favorite grisham book , followed by the firm , runaway jury , and pelican brief i found the broker to be too much of an italian lesson , the brethern simplistic , and the street lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people with very little story holding it together if you like the firm you will like the partner
here is the disclaimer i was already a proponent of tort reform before i read this book however , after reading this novel , i am a stronger proponent of it than ever enter clay carter unknown defender in d c of the poorest of the poor then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap , one he ca n't refuse , partly because the parent 's of his long time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money
this book is rather different although it 's about copernicus' book de revolutionibus , very little astronomy is discussed there is also very little about copernicus himself the main theme of the book is finding as many still existing copies of copernicus' book as possible , and describing each one in detail the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so called census of that ancient book , i e , a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world since i know nothing about antique book collecting , i learned a lot on this field by reading this book i was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book , especially identifying the authors of any hand written notes on its pages i did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous , but some of the author 's adventures are quite intriguing , particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book , as well as discussions of some of copernicus' contemporaries , are touched upon but as the author states , this book is really a memoir of his census project i think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting
like pretty much anything in which neil 's involved , this a fine and useful work the reviews of teddy millon 's axis ii taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves but after 30 years in the field , i 'll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you 're treating

i consider myself an optimist and insightful person , but somehow managed to miss many of postrel 's insights she gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than i previously thought she does keep that hope in check , though , by talking about the enemies of the future primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat , instead of the blessing that it is
after seeing the movie , i decided to pick up the book this book proved to be very funny , as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many , many women her age face today fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true , often serious real life topics \( being single and not liking it , infidelity , betrayal \) and is yet able turn it into light , funny reading that takes talent , in my book in the wrong hands , this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read \( in light of the above topics \) you cant help but root for bridget

mccain et al write very well and i was impressed by his style the writing was not the only style with which i became familiar but the style of the man himself , john mccain this was a truthful , revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less than honorable profession we can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father i believe this read is one to add to one 's readings of autobiographies biographies

this is what happens when uneducated reactionaries dictate to a concept that is beyond their comprehension it 's just more sanke oil from the same pigs who gave us the scams of deregulation \( capitalism governing itself \) , privatization \( the giveaway of what our taxes bought to those who pay little or no tax \) , and globalization \( repositioning the republican party to a time predating the emancipation proclamation \) hitler and mussolini would certainly approve
i first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990 's it aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion like many a cynic i asked myself , now who 's this guy and what 's he spinning \? against my natural inclination to dismiss it , i ordered pog on receiving it i began reading and found my suspicions confirmed here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of god

it is not often i reread a book but this was well worth it it is the true story of a cracker who set about trying to break into computer networks and how people from system administrators to the fbi try to stop him written in the style of a thriller , you are swept along in amazement at the exploits of the cracker if this does n't alter your view of internet security nothing will on the down side it becomes a chore trying to keep all the players straight in one 's head , it is indeed a cast of many although somewhat geeky at times and it does help to have some background in computer networking it wo n't prevent you from enjoying what is surely the most bizarre story of internet hacking you will read
as an econ student at uc davis , i have learned to appreciate books that explain concepts concisely and in an easily understandable way this is one of those few chapters are relatively short and are uncluttered with unnecessary examples or tangents graphs are labeled with simple explanations that are useful for clarification as well as quick reference

this is the sort of book i have been looking for a long time i 've read other books on the middle east which purport to have a similar focus , but which are instead incomplete , notably sowing the wind this book , by contrast , maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region it looks as if the book was written as a textbook for \( i would presume \) grad students studying the subject , but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal

the boom mr dent speaks of has begun but is starting in the population centers of the far east and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in america the boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers since so many of our publicly traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations , they are using that cost savings in order to finance the implementation of sarbanes oxley the net effect is that sarbanes oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of u s publicly traded companies this is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws so the industries that will expand will primarily focus around

you probably know joel siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on good morning america but do you know the rest of the story \? here 's a chance to find out
how does she do it \?
wilson does n't spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees he tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life you get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire it 's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds when he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite , you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow
my hat 's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review it is beyond anything i 've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines unlike the embedded journalists of our own time , the writers and photographers who covered vietnam were much closer to being free agents , restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of america 's military presence in southeast asia \( there it is \) , while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself
in 2003 i suffered my worst major depression ever it lasted for over a year , and in the worst moments which lasted months my anguish was so intense that i wished i were dead again , the worst part was when i could n't even get a full night 's rest , and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a m full of despair , unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief , and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching having to get up in the morning was hell needless to say i could n't work , and that increased my ill feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four \( we have two adolescent kids \)
when considering the faith of the founders of the u s , it is easy to rely on half truths and assumptions david holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well researched book which uses historical documentation , personal letters , and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused he begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th century which influenced our founders one interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government sponsored churches , a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation although many of the people he describes , including george washington , benjamin franklin , and thomas jefferson , were brought up in orthodox christian churches , such as episcopal and congregational , they were later influenced by the deist movement which opposed many orthodox christian views he describes some interesting practices , such as the fact that george washington would leave anglican services before participating in communion , despite the fact that his wife martha would stay for the sacrament this is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the deist leanings of her husband holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers' did in writing this book holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian , and which makes it all the more believable
this volume contains entries that deal with concepts , events , persons , and movements in u s history the length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered in addition , the entires both inform the reader with up to date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline the entries are clearly written and eminently readable they are persuasive in thier opionions , yet respectful of other stances the cross references are helpful and ample the same obtains for the bibliographies the oxford companion to u s history far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in u s history its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances the entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial i would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research

as a follower of christ \( christian \) who considers himself an evangelical protestant , this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart for all christian believers , the richness and power of brother lawrence 's life 's witness and words are a fountain of truth , a treasure that is as elegant \( spiritually \) as it is simple for the non believers , i am afraid that reading this booklet \( a spiritual treasure in disguise \) will just confirm st paul the apostles 's words that the message of the cross is foolishness to the gentiles \( 1 corinthians 1 18 , 23 and 2 14 \)
i love this cookbook use it all the time ! my daughter has many allergies \( tree nuts included \) so we have n't been able to use all the recipes , but those that we have are wonderful ! i keep checking back , hoping to see another book by this author , but have n't found any so far as for the rantings spoken about in another review i read the book cover to cover and did n't find anything that fits that description i enjoyed ms meyer 's stories of her children and her 'journey' and appreciate her having shared it thanks

i disagree with the reviewer who said that this book does not offer solutions again and again the author reports that people need to be heard , and need to stop repressing emotions to get well as a counselor working with battered women , i was amazed at the number of them who also had auto immune disorders such as fibromyalgia this book is a must read
i will probably write a few apa format papers while getting a master 's degree on line and i think for my limited use , apa the easy way is the right product for me i agree with other reviewers that if you do a lot of writing in the apa style , you may need the complete manual however , i have the complete manual and since i bought apa the easy way , i do n't think i will ever need to use the full size manual again i especially like that it gives step by step instructions on how to do all of the set ups for ms word
this item is a must have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints \( lds or mormons for short \) while not an authentic artifact , it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of america 's most successful and controversial social religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries

having read all of mccarthy 's other books already , i came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content and i was not disappointed mccarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters the vivid description of the mountains , the people , and their culture puts the reader right there in the story these harsh , terse , and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long , long time i found this story a little more abstract than most of mccarthy 's other works , yet i was able to see his message in the end required reading for any mccarthy fan
i bought this book along with saving dinner and saving dinner for the holidays last year
so here is a collection of essays by jonathan franzen , the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001 , the corrections many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as harper 's and the new yorker so , readers should know what they 're getting into i read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of franzen as a corporeal human being , and not just some exalted author of an award winning novel overall , i liked most of the essays appearing in this collection from the promising opener , in which franzen poignantly recounts his father 's slow descension into quietus from alzheimer 's , we progress to a quasi portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in america , before ashcroft and the patriot act invaded the american lexicon why bother \( which was previously referred to as the harper 's essay \) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st century as a tool of social reform the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform , but , should rather be written ultimately for plain old entertainment value , franzen seems to argue
i would first like to start by saying that the picture of dorian gray is , by far , one on my favorite novels and were i not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel i would have given it 5 stars , without a doubt
i used this book for an introductory lesson on descriptive cataloguing in library , archival and information science it worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach a lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way there are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding
ironically , socialist , anti american , iconoclastic professor taylor , could be , at least in this work , the inspiration for the great david irving 's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war it is demonstrated that adolph hitler , the popular nationalist german leader , was no more responsible , and in many ways less so , than the so called allies , who foolishly guaranteed poland , only to give her over to jewish bolshevism at yalta by refusing to grant germany 's rightful place as a continental power , britain and france lost millions of lives , their world empires , and their economic prominence the sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the soviets and their western fellow travellers and upon the final dissolution of the evil empire , courtesy of one dutch reagan , we have a european continent completely dominated by germany
in a sea of books from self proclaimed career counselors , mr corcodilos has no nonsense advice from a true insider instead of the usual yada yada , corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo
i loved this story it was enriched with so many lessons , emotions , and detail that you felt like you were right there with lous and oz i would recommend this story to any one ! !
i really enjoyed this book it took me a while to read it , about 2 months , because it 's definitely not fast paced i was glad i had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand
i liked track of the cat , but i did n't love it the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing , but the plot was , at times , predictable the setting was well drawn , but most of the characters were pretty one dimensional the clincher , though , is that i'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character i believe that this is her first story , so i do n't want to make a snap judgement , but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple that would be expecting a lot , i know , but frankly she is n't even as engaging as , say , gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael , and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch
exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago i also attended the guerilla business school , a 2500 intensive
this is one of my favorite books of all time , and during my 40 years of life i 've read a lot of them
as one reads peter pan , one does n't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim i had ridiculously high expectations of mr barrie 's imagination before purchasing this title , and he has fulfilled them completely
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
having patronized boulevard all but twice , i still feel the need to write a review you have to understand that those of us back east think that california food is understated and so easy now not being a huge chef myself , but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes \( my fave restaurants being of course , boulevard , and back east , 2941 , le tire bouchon , maestro , citronelle dc , galileo , inn at little washington , etc \) i have no clue where i 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook , other than maybe the san francisco ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market \( another real sf treat ! \) but to be real , we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised now i was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and i have her handwriting just ingredients , no measurements and yes , i 've been able to improvise , and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of recipes but nothing is better than going to the restaurant cookbooks are fab and fun , but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals \( herselves \) are even more exciting buy this book even just for the photographs , as i 've never been in a more well decorated and well thought out restaurant if only i did n't live on the east coast !

do n't get me wrong , this was an enjoyable read since retiring matthew hope i guess em had an urge to return to sw florida with this tale funny adult repartee and a good mystery but only age 9 12 reading level according to the amazon rating \? \? these latest books from mcbain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a tv episode rate , but how about trying to stretch a bit
i have spent a lot of time and money researching into mormon history the big problem is that , as henry ford once said history is bunk with joseph smith and the history of the mormon church , there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many , an ingenious charlatan there are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide hence , using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of joseph smith can be a very frustrating \( and sometimes expensive \) exercise the church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony , but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony it is easy to see from my statement above , why
i call this one frank peretti lite it was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare , this one had a creationist angle i really enjoyed it , just not the same as his other books also , you have to remember that this is fiction of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible but the central point about mutations comes through great summer read
i have n't had a chance to read the book in its entirity , but have enjoyed what i have read
this book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript the images are combined with the text to convey meaning in the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context
one reviewer of this book said he 's sick of investing tomes , they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors , who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients
this book was horrible if it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books , especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items , which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug , self serving and self indulgent , written by a person with little or no empathy , especially for the people he castigates for example , his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders
i'm not sure who 's writing these reviews , but i read repitition after repitition after repitition , with a lot of confusing fluff asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues what 's fierce about that \?
i picked up the first book in this series \( the eyre affair \) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed still , the potential for the series seemed so large that i went ahead and read this second one too , only to be even less enchanted with the franchise this is a pure sequel , and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of thursday next is strict order , lest one miss out of allusions to past events although on further consideration , maybe it does n't matter , since clearly anything can and will happen in this series , and fforde is n't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway
not only do i disagree with his opinions , but some of his facts are blatently false on page 106 he refers to violence agains native americans by european settlers as isolated instances and not planned nor calculated had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable
i have received your new book against the human race , and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs , in reading your book , to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years , i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada , because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves voltaire \( 1755
this book was on somebody 's amazon com listmania for sea turtles , so i hunted it down it is only vaguely about sea turtles , in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book , and then he disappears , so it 's obvious that he was involved in the crime
i am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book honestly , it was a complete waste of my time to quote a friend , it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar if you are a fan of pedestrian writing , lack luster plots and hackneyed character development , this is your book
when professor polk describes the sweep of history in iraq , he is at his best , but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts much of the political ranting is supposition , marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work the ranting gets especially tedious towards the end my advice , read the first part and skip the last half
this is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution china the 5 people live relatively miserable lives , touched by official corruption and incompetence \( with the exception of one who benefits handsomely \) china is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality , with widespread corruption , and widespread incompetence this view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years this book is an interesting read as gossip often can be , but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day china
this is the sixth book in the left behind series it is also the first one in the series i did not finish in one sitting it did not flow as well as the others , so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening the book also spends a lot of time re telling what we read in previous books i felt this time like i read half a novel
this book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger , imperial powers said condemns intellectuals in the west who in his eyes are agents of exploitation yet said himself is an agent of racism
oh , yes this is a very fine book for me to poop on !
hands down this is bukowski 's single worst book bought it when it first came out just before after his death in 1994 having read just about everything the man had written , pulp was a hugely disappointing epitaph if you 've never read bukowski start with post office or the short story collections , but avoid this like the plague a bad book i ca n't think of a single reason to recommend it
very average book ! frei does n't go down as one of my favorite sports writers loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story
this book had a good message , and could have had a lasting impact on me but the plot was obscenely dull , and the middle of the book \( gene and finny relationship \) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book not recommended
finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty ! yunnus has proven , by the success of his bank 's loans to the desperately poor , that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support founder of the grameen bank , he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world \( including the us and canada \) have shown that lending to the poor , helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye opener it made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help it 's hard to separate the book from the idea one is as fascinating as the other out of 5 points , i give it a six
while reading this book i found the details of some cases to be unbelievable also , the photographs of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings i 've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim 's hair or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore and who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent doberman pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence \? sure , just let that dog on in and whose place of employment has a record of all employee 's blood groups \( not their types , just their groups \) , when the employee does n't even know himself what group he is \?
i was disappointed in this book especially after reading the other stellar reviews \( which are all , weirdly , from texas , where the author lives \)
he gave it all he had , but there just was n't much of interest there he 's a self described , turmoiled loser , and not very interesting one to boot kafka , roth , and jeremy leven \( satan , et al \) , write about similar troubled jews , and are much funnier and interesting i like his honesty , but , it 's not worth the price of admission
the paleo diet is based on an interesting premise the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment it seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time , because their decisions are instinctual self awareness creates a problem that does n't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans sometimes we do things out of curiosity , or laziness , or false beliefs so , considering the erratic behavior of present day humans , who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs \? even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error , frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild
if you want a biased and misleading account of the arab war against israel , this ought to satisfy you
did n't care for this book at all if you want to learn about stephen king you 'd be much better off reading or listening to his book on writing
i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure , but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold , but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little
i want to make a short comment here
what a bunch of high school hallway gossip ! the author does not know the difference between white and albino ! the 'genetics' discussions on color \( which includes people , chickens , horses , and dogs all of it suspect \) and mutts vs purebred dogs are total claptrap ! i confess , i could n't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies ' what \? \? a waste of my hard earned having read those parts i cannot believe anything that went before or that follows , not that i'm reading any further how is a multi published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print \? and now she 's influenced readers a terrible situation publisher , where are your pre publication reviews \? shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published !
this book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if james frey did not repeat himself a million times
not all that useful , really message is buy mutual funds ! in general , since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market , just buy index funds would be the best advice most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the ceo to go over the financials and confirm your valuation oh , thanks peter , what great advice \( mr gates , your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares \)
the biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming i thought i was buying a book about knitting , but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions
just finished reading this novel this morning and i think it is probably the weakest one of the lot like a lot of reviewers , i did n't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the stephanie plum series as well , the supposed sexual tension love triangle between stephanie , joe and ranger is approaching its use by date it is definitely becoming boring and i think ms evanovich needs to resolve stephanie 's romantic situation once and for all i still enjoy characters like lula and grandma mazur but a lot of the situations stephanie found herself in fell flat with me there are only so many times she can have her car blown up , handbag destroyed , apartment broken into , etc , before it becomes tiresome and repetitive i still think there is a spark of life in the stephanie plum series , but i hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by the numbers as this one
there are plenty of excellent play therapy books out there , this is not one of them maybe it 's just me , but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly i need quick access , color and art
when you have lost weight , it 's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off whenever they have heard me tell my story , read my blog or book , or found out that i did it on the low carb lifestyle , one question invariably has come up from time to time
this book is just plain stupid if it works for people and helps them lose weight i realize they will be estatic however , it is not healthy each of our meals should be balanced these people are promoting unbalanced eating the reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs ! if one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups , including complex carbs in small amounts , we would not only lose weight in a safe manner , but we would heal our bodies from the inside out this diet wo n't heal us , it is a fad if anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism , lose weight and even heal disease , try reading the schwarzbein principle by diana schwarzbein , md that is a great book on how to heal diabetes , hypoglycemia , and many other things it also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight , but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place this book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss , not getting healthy
no wonder john gardner did n't write more fiction books he was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction , rather than actually writing it creative atrophy i believe john gardner himself would call it if there 's ever been a better example of the those who ca n't do , teach argument , i have n't encountered it this is hardly the place a young writer should start instead , how about reading what you like and avoiding ignoramouses such as john gardner \? john gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world 's finest writers never made it through college , and many more did n't have the luxury of a rigorous classical education the most hilarious part is where gardner mentions that only through a line by line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy shakespeare it 's interesting to note how gardner , who taught creative writing at the university level , fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
this was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author 's task management system this was the beginning of the scientific management line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book the essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time he also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success still , a reader should n't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources the book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers
i know a lot of people liked this book , but it did n't work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off , acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is , they did n't there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot , and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin , early on , but no one does , not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation
if tony hillerman wrote this novel \( novella actually \) , i sure ca n't tell i have been a chee leaphorn fan for many years , but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman 's other work it is reminiscent of a 'b' movie instead of building suspense , the plot is laid out all too plainly , the characters are unreal , and the chee bernie romance does n't ring true i am amazed that it was published
i gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas the best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book i have read carolyn , bill , and amy 's books and i want to give this one a try
really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract and disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields , so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book , because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic , oppressed other type of woman , thanks
this was one of five books that i brought from amazon com and by far the worst of the lot this man has one idea about how the government really works take it from me i have been with the irs for five years
i bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane not one of my better decisions very wordy , and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it 's totally absurd reminds me of the way the cops talked in dragnet we are talking zero development of characters perhaps mr woods feels he does n't need to give any depth to characters that he 's been writing about in previous books well , he 's wrong you basically just do n't care about these people they are n't real , and they talk weird not much action either , unless you count actions like they got in the car they got in the boat they got in the plane you get the picture this is another case of a well known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money do n't fall into his trap like i did there are a lot better books out there
should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision \? i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle designed to make the question of martha mdiddy 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side \? by normalizing , generalizing , and minimalizing martha mdiddy 's crimes , are we loosing our morality \? how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company \?
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death
i found this book very boring tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
i am by no means an economist , and much less an expert on finance , but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled , unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis i 've seen much subtler discussions of the efficient market hypothesis written for general audiences , enough of them so i can recognize that lowenstein does n't get it he equates efficient markets with the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value , and not with you ca n't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do this is a crucial difference , because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water
inspired by his uncle , eddie , who worked at an amusement park , albom writes a well coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife , which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience the concept is old a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths there are concepts to be learned from the five people the story is delightful and cavalier
this is a moderately well spun book about the no spin zone should be called the know spin zone since really nothing in it is objective o'reilly is a case study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this in other words it 's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it if you ca n't see through o'reilly 's bias then this book is poison
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then , the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan , i would not recommend this book
hey here 's an idea what if hitler was right all along , only it is men , not jews , who are to blame for all the woes of the world we should build a new auschwitz and exterminate them all right andrea \? in my opinion , this is just as bad as any misogynist it 's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women 's liberation movement back for so long
the glorious cause is the sequel to rise to rebellion , and since the first novel was so good i eagerly dove into this one , but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization on a scale of 1 to 10 , i give it a 4 , as compared to the 8 i would give rise to rebellion
do yourself a favor do n't waste your time with this book
if you 're thinking of reading this book , let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy \( really \) , and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners , but this book , in perfectly plain english , sucked there is no plot , no beginning , middle or end , and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help , but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
not as good as entre nous less fun and more acedemic but even then it is not a well written essay the few good salient points are repeated too often , and with not much creativity or development
the other boleyn girl and the queen 's fool are two of the best books i 've ever read and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin 's lover fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced , constructed i'm going back to trollope
i listened to this as an audiobook this is the worst book i 've ever listened to from audible the worst the narration is just too , too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best unfortunately , i keep hearing emperor franz josef in amadeus saying , it has , well , too many notes barr describes everything \( including clothes , hair , shoes , etc \) with multiple metaphors , a plethora of adjectives , and , well , too many notes i kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story
i am a nevada barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with high country the story takes place in a restaurant \( boring \) the characters were dull and i kept getting them confused anna 's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome i also missed anna 's sister , molly , who is only mentioned a few times in the book
this is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter the suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out the suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big \( duh \) and then group like items together \( duh \) that 's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system oh is that affordable \? if i had 75 , 000 to redo my kitchen i would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins come on , do n't waste your money on this book or it 's suggestions very few pictures and all for the rich i thought good housekeeping was for the everyday family get it at the library and then return it after you do n't read it
hmm , quite a disappointment , especially after splurging on the hardcover edition set as a kind of rockies rear window , this is one slow story endless pages of crazy making when i 'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through finally skipped ahead to finish the book i had really looked forward to angels fall , too \( if you are a roberts fan , do n't spend the money on the hardcover , wait for the paperback , go to the library , or borrow from a friend not worth the price

the back cover to this book was intriguing , and captured me immediately the writing , however , was so plodding , so inconsistent , and so non sequential that it was painful to get through to the end this is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day i ca n't believe that this book made it past the editors in one paragraph jon katz tells how rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet , and in the next he says that rose is too young to herd sheep in one paragraph he ca n't live without his wife , she gives his very existence meaning , and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to what was it again \? oh , right , herd sheep ! at one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he ca n't connect to and finally gives away and then ca n't stop visiting , even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog and why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys there 's a reason , jon !
from the remarks at this site , people either love this novel or hate it i hated it i hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about mfa program writing in the last 30 years the emphasis is entirely on style forget story forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere some of this thinking goes back to henry james , some of it goes back to virginia woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits \( like h g wells' the time machine \) the first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom frank bascombe is trying to sell a property it 's brilliantly written in fact , it 's so brilliantly written that i had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life , his loves , and the region of the country he inhabits this book has no driving plot in fact , it 's an arbitrarily chosen conceit what happens on july 4th in the life of one guy it 's not james joyce 's ulysses nor is it trying to be , but every thought this man has is in this book and none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person any perso should pick up the book
this was the first hard case publication book that i have tried it wo n't be the last , but i was hardly impressed with king 's story
i'm an avid reader of history , as well as processing a degree in the subject so imagine my surprise when , after receiving this book from a friend of mine for christmas , i read the erroneous account of the children 's crusade of 1212 i had done research on this topic , so i was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years \? if he had , he would have realized that there were actually two crusades one consisting of mainly french people led by stephen of cloyes who , when told to turn back by king philip ii , did so that ended that crusade the other one , led by a shepherd from germany named nicholas , led a group across the alps into italy some left for home while others continued on to rome it 's interesting to note that in rome , many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these children were either too old or because they were pregnant perhaps until relatively recently , people believed in the children 's crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles \( like chronica albrici monachi trium fontium \) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred , rather than relying on more contemporary sources nor did they realize that the latin word pueri used in the chronicles can have several meanings \( such as unmarried men rather than children \)
the bottom line on brainless is that one has to be brainless to take time to read coulter 's writings , and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them
are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better of course if his models were worth more than the paper they 're written on mandelbrot would n't have to write books like this because he 'd be cleaning out everyone else 's wallets on the stock market in particular , if it 's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative but the fact is , mandelbrot does n't know anything that countless other traders do n't already know so instead mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on wall street
to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in left behind would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start
while this book contains a ton of data , do n't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade if you look up french toast , for example , it only gives information on name brand items much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products i suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping , or use it before eating out , it would be helpful but if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items , you are out of luck with this book
this book was selected by my book club i had never read anna quindlen before rise and shine was a disappointment to me i kept hoping that meghan would somehow be redeemed , but that did not happen she is really not very likeable i thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning leo 's tradgedy meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again the book left me with an empty feeling it was not a satisfying read
in addition to the fact that i , too , felt that i was enduring a commercial for dfa , i was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of the only guide to a winning investment strategy you 'll ever need index mutual funds and beyond the way smart money invests today , swedroe 's may , 1998 book he introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations , but if you 've read the first book , there 's no reason to look at this one
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
i received a book that i did n't even order the one i ordered is yellow and white \( 3th edition \) this is n't the one i ordered therefore , i need a refund i sent the book back and i know the seller received it on 8 19
it is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now coulter 's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like ms coulter piously hypocritically rail against she will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self selected audiences of something they already want to believe pitiful rants here if you are in it for fun or do n't care that you are getting a skewed , sensationalist opinion , maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store but for something better , why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed , analytical approach , rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst \( on both right and left \) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs \( more than the other 2 \) , and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , collapse a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now rk
when the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice he is a criminal and must be treated like one christian peper
hal abelson is responsible for a famous epigram , if i have n't seen as far as others , it is because giants were standing on my shoulders
author la guardia mentions how the lemba of africa have the jewish gene fine ! but when he deals \( in several pages mind you \) with the falashas \( also of africa \) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these jews not to be descended from the 12 tribes of israel despite the falashas 's longtime rep for possibly being a lost tribe of israel which , again , has now been 100 disproven through genetic studies
just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions
i first read passages from this book in college i can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds professor zinn is a far left author he uses the usual lines america generally bad , communism generally good obviously mr zinn has the right to write whatever he wants , and his writing style is very convincing however , if the reader investigates the facts , many holes become visible in his theories those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints a good example is intellectual morons how ideology makes smart people fall for stupid ideas by daniel j flynn which gives the reader a good profile of mr zinn
poorly proof read and obfuscatingly written , this book had the potential to clarify for the many the importance of black 's contributions it was a frustrating read due to lack of clarity and lack of simple explanations about the significance of black 's work
i agree with the reader \( s \) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown together , as if no one proofread it in one chapter she 'll recommend something then later on she 'll tell you it 's ineffective and or dangerous ! she gives a long , long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments , recommendations or opinions of her own personally i think most natural herbal supplements are a ripoff , but if she had given any testimonials by people who 've found them to work , i might consider trying them on the whole , this book is a waste of money
what a complete and utter waste of time its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots
i 've been a fan of heinlein 's sf for just about as long as i 've been an sf fan at all \( somewhere around thirty five years \) but when i read this collection some twenty odd years ago , it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether
i have to say i truly hated this book the premise sounded interesting so i decided to give it a try i 've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky this time i found her usual friends and co workers to be boring and self involved caricatures the groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way the constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows this is my last cromwell
there is n't anything in this book that you wo n't find in warren buffett 's annual letters to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway \( available for free at the berkshire hathaway website \) if you 've not read those letters then i suggest you get right to it they clearly lay out mr buffett 's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read , humorous and homely style
the last river the tragic race for shangri la tragic yes i 'd agree that this book is tragic
this books should be called the random thoughts of a rich old man it appears to me someone followed mr buffet around and wrote down what ever he said then thought how do i present this is a book \? , oh how about a random collection of dis jointed thoughts ! yea that 's it ! !
this book is great ! assuming you already have a ph d in political science otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting , or light reference the author shows bias towards the united states' form of democracy , as is to be expected in such a book the simplistic nature makes the reader annoyed more than informed the childish approach is suited for school children , but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis
in his book , the four agreements , don miguel ruiz , embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life he says that we should be impeccable with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our best the basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents he calls this process domestication \( p 6 \) ruiz says that 95 of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection the agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives
hart disputes o'reilly 's claim that the us gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else by countering that per capita the u s is near the bottom of the list o'reilly was n't quoted as saying more tax money per capita
after two weeks on this diet plan i could bearly lift my head up i nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights not to mention hardly staying awake while at work i thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of atkins , but i was never tired on atkins i do n't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs or what the problem was all i know is i am happily following atkins and losing much more rapidly than i did on this cad plan in two weeks i lost 6 lbs on cad 14 on atkins you figure it out
this book , above all others , reveals the breakdown of classical \( libertarian \) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today although the first part of the work , being a refutation of edmund burke 's silly nonsense , is stellar , and is well worth reading regardless , the second part , the chapter on ways and means in particular , is composed of the most despicable , anti liberty doctrines that one can find what paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state , replete with progressive taxation , subsidies for child birth , and other fine statist amenities thus , as all of these things are , in his words , to be claimed as rights , the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever it is indeed sad that thomas paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty in truth , he is actually one of its worst enemies , as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression , revolution , and reason , he sabotages his entire political philosophy
i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts , but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments as i was flipping through the book , i found x rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore , and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
anyone that knows anything about milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs , and contributed much more to society than people like james stewart , who often act like parasites at the expense of others
i recently saw this book on the bargain bin this book was pure garbage , by two arrogant 20 somethings in clown suits basically they are saying valuations do n't matter since they wrote the book , it has been prooven that their philosophy , approached over the long term , produces some great damaging losses the book may be useful during the next bubble , which if history serves , will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three ring circus in the sky to the dungeon with these two knaves
our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book as the facilitator , i was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection the writing is disjointed to the point that ms krauss loses her reader then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters , the reader is left extremely frustrated i really cannot imagine how ms krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews
i am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book i guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans , but i just do n't see what was great , or even good , about this story
before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead as it turns out i made the best decision all i can say is `thank you fellow reviewers' this book was definitely not worth the purchase price my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a skilled writer it has everything to do with his lack of insight that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary i read the book , waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book
the book jacket for the ruins offers a ca n't miss premise a group of post grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger it 's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach but 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket
the book the lost continent is an amazing captivating read bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions this cd totally kills that first of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute , sometimes to the point where you ca n't understand him and second , they abridged the crap out of it , cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire second half of the book ! while the book is amazing , this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs
i found this book very boring tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper
what a waste of time this was like sitting through a very boring business course i was never interested in turning the page i would have liked to see more of carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story instead i felt like a robot was telling this story very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else i forced myself to finish this a huge diaappointment do n't waste your money
i am a huge fan of kathy reichs' novels and of the tv series , bones however , this book was quite a disappointment to me i did not care for the way the author wrote dialogue brennan 's dialog is not that simplimatic on the tv program , and she certainly would never say , where at ! \? the author way overused the joke where brennan did not know what that means
this is a badly written , repetitive and self serving account , largely , of the foolishness of portflio insurance that things which are just like something else may not be so in reality , and that magic fixes in the market \( which after all fly in the face of the rational expectations efficient market hypotheses which often are built into the view of the market being relied on \) i guess needs to be pointed out regularly , since hope of quick , uninformed , and painless fixes seem to reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed on jacobs does point out such problems for a particular , rather bizarre episode , and suggests , not too coherently , that such scams are still prevalent however , he does this in a horribly repetitive and self laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued
design of book is very poor pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story the translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
ageless body is deepak 's attempt to neutralize the word old as in old age the writer has a knack for making common words , like body , mind and self , into profound concepts his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound
this book is so full of misinformation that i shudder to think \( since it is in the dummies series \) , that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog
you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library
i 'll preface this by saying i'm a cryer i cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining i cried all the way through superman returns i did not , however , shed one tear during message in a bottle
more hate books how could anyone write anything so wrong
i started reading this book expecting to like it it 's historical , related to little women , won the pulitzer , does n't feel like fluff , etc however i had a really difficult time getting into the book
while i found the writing style good and the information interesting , the actual diet was unrealistic , too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable i found myself longing for spices \( how bad could pepper really be \? \) and questioning the validity of their restriction i could n't stand the ground up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it \( or what i imagine that to be \)
author la guardia mentions how the lemba of africa have the jewish gene fine ! but when he deals \( in several pages mind you \) with the falashas \( also of africa \) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these jews not to be descended from the 12 tribes of israel despite the falashas 's longtime rep for possibly being a lost tribe of israel which , again , has now been 100 disproven through genetic studies
as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction , however midway it turns into a romance novel i give it 3 stars for holding my attention a good beach read that can get you thinking \( a little \) about a time past the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it 3 stars
being a student of photojournalizm in moscow , russia , i looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available i had studied one book on the subject by the russian author , but knowing that photography in the us is much more developed and professional i was striving to get a book by a professional photographer
although dead soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for doss , who has a tin ear for dialogue , dearly loves a cardboard character , and has no sense of plot , it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities
the winner and absolute truth made me continue reading baldacci books his last few books christmas train and split second were awful now baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats that was the last money i ever spend on a baldacci book , i even threw out his good books shut up baldacci and write fiction books your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world
a friend going through the same problems as i am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me , as well i was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions if i could actually use the information to help myself , all the better i was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through , so i struggled through it , expecting it to get easier to read it did n't it 's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and i'm really sorry because i'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting , but i just ca n't get past that page 104 i normally refuse to leave a book half unread , but this just has to be an exception because every time i pick it up i fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages
this is the worst , most depressing piece of fiction i have ever read there is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration and after a while , their actions just become inexplicable the author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book it starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of neil gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions additionally , the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands , nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease what is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all unlike some of stephen king 's work \( ie the stand \) , there is absolutely no redeeming thread here no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil it 's evil in evil vs evil surrounded by evil all i can say is that this book is ugly , ugly , ugly at least writers like joyce carol oats and joseph conrad 's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness , but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable the choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all i suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as i could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence , i literally stopped mid sentence and chose to never read this author 's work again it 's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist , dave mckean , who maybe has n't completely gone over to the dark side like neil has his association with dave mckean is the only reason i even opened up the book and maybe a little because the title intrigued me but it 's unfortunate that the industry rewards clever works such as mr gaiman 's with undue praise i 've never so strongly disliked a book have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book \? well , do n't believe the hype , this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with x men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you
if julia glass had not set the bar so high with three junes , i would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2 there are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the national book award gave ms glass unconditional confidence in her writing , and character development in particular she seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around as another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed transparant reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what ms glass \( a privileged white woman of a certain age \) imagines teenagers , or new mexicans , or black chauffeurs , or hispanic nannies , or even gay people to be like she is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them the teenagers and the santa fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures greenie might be the most believable , and although i understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy alan , i was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with the other charlie he was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth \( even temporarily \) losing your child over with saga , she manages to develop her most sympathetic character , but saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end even the brief appearance of fenno , who i loved in three junes , lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky all and all , a very disappointing second novel you have to wonder , since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character , what good is her editor \?
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent , he had a crappy upbringing , that does not make for a good book
when i read this , i was not expecting to become a commie , but at least i was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories \( especially re jews \) that the authors came up with
this seemed too long and too drawn out
simple arithmetic and you know it 's stupid to expect much from a 227 content book that attempts to tell the success stories and forumlas of 55 business leaders definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4 13 pages so i had lowered my standard before i read it still i had been quite disappointed all passages were columns published previously on ibd written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data history and success formula , primarly on the former i am sorry that i could gain little knowledge insight \( that i really wanted to learn how they succeeded \) during the reading i felt even worse after reading from the previous reviewer that the content had been available on the net in short , please give this book a pass !
the most anticipated book in the history of poker ! exclaims a blurb on the cover well , if so , i can tell you that a lot of people have been , or are going to be , very disappointed comparing the classic super system from 1978 with this book is , to paraphrase mark twain , like comparing lightning to the lightning bug
i'm in a good mood today , and feeling generous hence the two stars secrest learned that rodgers could be a rotten person , that he drank and was a womanizer she then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length i did n't count the words , but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on rodgers and hammerstein not to mention the post hammerstein years we learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory it 's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums i 've kept most of my theater books , except for this one it went to the used book store
someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of daniel silva books and got them removed ! hmm , i wonder who that could be
i 've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks , and i could n't wait to read dear john well , there was no reason to rush it starts out okay , but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him , instead of just pouting over her for most the book
i 'd heard the buzz \( both pro and con \) and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and does n't let go mercy stands out from all the rest you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
of the 7 or so grisham novels ive read this one is my least favorite
if you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy , then this is the book for you this book has no insight on anything it is vague it doesnt explain anything in detail it talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing , but that is as far as that goes its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more ! you might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor it has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high risk pregnancy
i find some parts of didion 's book very relatable , at least when she 's exploring her feelings of shock , the superstitious feelings , and the obsessive re living of her husband 's last few days and death but these sections become less and less frequent as the book continues , and it all seems to devolve
beware of the everyman 's library edition of this book \( green hardcover , ribbon marker , isbn 0 679 40564 x \) book v dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted according to the introduction , this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low i wish i had known this before i ordered the book since now i have to buy a different edition in order to read book v what a ripoff
this guy 's box is missing a few tools most of the stuff he quotes as fact is not supported in real life he 's full of crap everybody knows walking is good for you , but kevin t starts his chapter on walking by saying that 'when you take your dog for a walk , he \( or she \) poops well la de f ing da is n't that why you take your dog for a walk because you do n't want him \( or her \) to poop in the house then there 's his statement that if you put your teflon pan on high heat and have a parakeet on your shoulder , the bird will keel over dead because of the poisonous gasses and another thing , who ever heard of an acidic body \? \? \? i think i know what planet trudeau came from uranu

i really liked suzanne summers i 've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video when i saw her on the today show advertising this book i could n't wait to get it
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs \( more than the other 2 \) , and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , collapse a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now rk
when our book club selected this novel , i was enthusiastic the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story however , after the first chapter or so , i kept waiting for the big wow factor and it never came i found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well developed like other readers , i finished it out of obligation , but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it
while i enjoy adventure stories for the casual reading they are and have read all of cussler 's , i was disturbed by a lot of the assumptions in this and other of his recent books this is transparently hawkish an ultra conservative defense of the questionable actions of the very furthest right of the political spectrum \( one could even suspect it was commissioned or at least underwritten by these elements \) it reflects the current culture that decrees all means justify the end as long it benefits the right people cussler 's recent books portray that it 's okay for americans to go into other countries with which we are not at war and kill its citizens for some secret government agenda that it 's okay for our us government to hire out black ops in secret because it 's against our laws to do so openly through the years , i 've tolerated cussler 's blatant sexism , juvenile writing style , improbable exploits of cartoonish heroes however , he has veered into political territory that offends me but even more , terrifies me that it may be the truest part of his stories
using this book and cd rom depends upon being able to download the customized settings , so that the reader 's photoshop , for example , behaves the same way as the author 's photoshop however , my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the cd rom furthermore , this author does n't start at a dummies level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons , so i had trouble following along overall , this was n't much help for me in my quest to learn photoshop from a baseline of complete ignorance
horribly disappointing
huge disappointment trace was n't that good either having read all scarpetta 's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one however , the downhill trend seems to continue these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing save your money , do n't buy it i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far , so i wo n't go into the plot or rather lack of a real plot details

my mother in law was actually responsible for billy milligan while he was in the athens state hospital in ohio i 've had a chance to read this book , and although very good , what my mother in law tells me is much , much different
a very disappointing book , and again , makes me very wary of any item on a new york times best seller list or any other list , and really any big name reviewer recommendation
dr northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies , stages of life and medical procedures however , i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced , with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women as a catholic whose best teachers were strong minded , compassionate religious sisters , i felt offended by her slur against nuns i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing , but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research
the whole concept of this book as well as the honesty of the undertaking i'm not buying it the author 's effort is half a ed at best
this book is the reason i 've read only one john updike novel i was so disgusted by the people , the plot , and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that i never read another updike i thought the characters were completely unrealistic
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia is this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note at the end of the book we read sep 10 , 1990 nov 10 , 1993 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted
i bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned it looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information
this novel is set in the 40 's , when elizabeth short \( the black dahlia \) was found murdered , her body cut in two the characters revolve around the investigation of this incident , altnough her name is changed the chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers one , an amoral cop , the other , a catholic priest , monsignor , businessman , whatever you want to call him neither one is likable , the 40 's cop jargon is incomprehensible , and the catholic politics building programs are boring however , the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow
i have loved each and every one of jane hamilton 's other novels and highly recommend them the book of ruth , a map of the world , short history of a prince and disobedience this book , sadly , does not rank among them it feels forced and uninteresting , with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios i 've already paid for it , so i 'll probably try to finish it , but do n't waste your time or money read another hamilton instead
this is a great book if you have the right teacher the book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you i also recomend that you make sure your copy has a cd rom the study guide and website are great tools too they help a lot
this book was very disappointing i loved her 1st two books so when this book came out i was very excited after reading it , i found it was rather dull and not very funny there were very few parts that actually made me laugh , unlike her 1st two books
i read exactly half the book and stopped based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending , that was a good decision as it is there went hours of my life i wo n't get back ! the book is silly and laughable the premise sounded great but the book is bad really bad
robert kiyosaki 's books are all the same thing re packaged over and over again this book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it 's readers a lot of time he writes in an arrogant , condescending manner that is hard to stomach i would hate to have been his real dad it 's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of rich dad it 's offensive and disturbing
the author lives in a dream world and is not in touch with the business work environment of today her advice is old fashioned and out of date many better textbooks on ethics available
i had this one figured out by the second chapter too predictable and shallow hopefully , the next stone book will actually be worth reading
a disappointing book about a fabulous story the book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and , if you look at the chapter notes , this appears to be how it was researched
even with the questionable veracity , i enjoyed frey 's first book , a million little pieces , since it stayed true to an addict 's experience leonard , on the other hand , came off as pure fantasy , with very little substance even the description of frey 's struggle was too contrived to be believable it was not even interesting as fiction
at the height of socialist popularism in england , cir 1944 , george orwell , a leading proponent of socialism , believing in its promises as did many , if not most of eurpose 's leading intellectuals and politicians , wrote a review of hayek 's famous book , the road to serfdom orwell wrote the review in the observer , london april 9 , 1944
this has to be one of the most ridiculous books i have ever read at one point the authors ask if money equals security , would n't you feel safe walking through a major american city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist \? if money really did equal security , you would ! i stopped reading after that
if you have fond memories of ms steele , or no memory at all because you 're new to her , please do n't read this book
i heard about this book growing up but did n't read it until just recently \( a middle aged adult \) and i have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written , i e , it was so shocking and disgusting ! such filth ! i mean , that 's why i heard about the book when i was growing up but as so many others have already pointed out , it is tame by today 's standards i also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the female protagonist is completely a male fantasy the book 's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man 's part now , you see , what struck me about sir clifford 's situation , and lady chatterley 's , for that matter , is if they really loved each other , his paralysis from the waist down would n't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms there are other things that can be done , yes \? in fact , quite possibly connie would have had an orgasm for the first time ! \( ahem , women readers will know what i mean \) but clifford treated connie poorly with or without the lack of sex issue , i think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway which to me , just goes to show that a man wrote the book a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick
i bought this book on a friend 's recommendation if i had been in a book store and could have read a page or two i would have known immediately it was not the type of book i would read i'm sure it 's wonderful for those who like it i passed it on to a friend
this story was about a young brother trying to make it in life
this book is filthy i had to take a shower after i read it why does n't he get a job \? why does he have to live in france \? why does n't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers \? so many questions people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned it was banned because it 's a bad book
i enjoyed the first 3 books of the women 's murder club did n't like too much the 4th \( of july \) , but the 5th is just bad ! what 's the plot \? there is no plot ! 2 serial killer stories try to share the pages of this not such a page turner , the 1st mystery \( car girls \) get solved mid way throught the book and i bet plenty of readers wo n't remember it by the end of this painfull read by trying to develop 2 stories , patterson gets our interest for none the most sad thing of all is that i used to like to women 's murder club members , but now they all seem so unreal , remote from anything actually likeable and it 's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club , in the most stupid , artificial way really not much to save this book , it 's even badly written do n't know if patterson thinks about writting a 6th , but do n't count on me next time
i bought this off of the new york public library website what an utter waste of 40 the book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful , but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while the worst part is the software that you are supposed to use to catalog your books first of all , it is difficult to install this is always a sign of a inferior product no product that was properly qa 'd would be released in such condition second of all , the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet i could literally use excel or ms access to catalog my books just as well as this software you actually have to input every piece of data associated with a book there is no excuse for anyone with an internet connection to have to manually input book data i state again it is very surprising that the new york public library would include this product in their stores it is a major , major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there
i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that having said that i did not like this book
i bought this book with big aspirations of another joy of cooking with a little upscale to it while i must say the design of the book is fabulous \( i am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook 's design \) , the recipes leave much to pine for i do n't like that most of the ingredients are nothing i normally keep in the house and i am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them i have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and i have owned the book for over a year i will stick to joy of cooking for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen
maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender but , by the reviews here , all by women , i can see that jance writes to that crowd her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue , the insulin bottle jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time if you want a good mystery read coben , crais , patterson or michael connely
al gore is making a good road to tell us the facts on global warming , but he is missing the fact that in 3 4 years we will have the new ice age coming and billion of people on earth will die and he is missing 40 60 of the cause of the global warming the book is good and bad we can stop this global warming in one month but we cant' do it untill we will expose the real cause of it think about in one month we can stop it each month \( in the next 2 years \) we will postpone the truth is just bad
this book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille very weak and ordinary
i have read some memoirs of the 2nd ww from a german standpoint and this was not one of the better although very fascinating at times it was also oddly detached and some of the stories about his sniping seemed made up it sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable
the kite runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up , stay focused , and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until now
i purchased this book to gain a better insight about aspergers instead , it left me with many unanswered questions the book is the equivalent to a boring , monotonous `dear diary' that gets stuck in one era his college years and his interest in music \( this is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college , and music is all he knows \) yet i craved more details , i wanted to know more about mr shores' childhood , his parents , the stims , and the chaos details !
the story opens well and hooks the reader however , the ending is a disappointment and comes across as cliche and predictable i gave it two stars because there was not a category for a 1 and a half
the audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep not a good thing while drivin
if you want to spend 4 times as much money , 8 times as much time , and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately politely refuse then buy this book ! the author clearly has no clue that less is often more
i originally bought this title when it came out as a four part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection
i did not like the book it did have some interesting points to consider , but it did not seem like discipline to me i am more of a love and logic fan i think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior \( or do n't care \) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them , which this book says not to do i just do n't agree with it
myth 1 american women live under patriarchy
i just finished listening to as much of the book on cd as i could stomach the minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating the words forhead , perp , peruse , crim , and finger were repeated over and over and over what might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone 's clothing , spouses , children , and thinking
this book is so outdated all the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980 's and earlier , which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past there are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
its a good book to draw examples of idustries in different stages of technology evolution however it is lacking in theoretical content ,
and i suspect this is what has happened to james lee burke the dave robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now and that is tragic , considering the promise of the early books , which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful in the electric mist with confederate dead
i am newly preg too i went out and got this book without reading any reviews i sum it up this way a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension i ca n't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a great old time enjoying those pains you will be feeling ! ie and all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet ha ha ha
dr rieux , the main character of the novel , moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague
not very scary , too long , and poor character development there are a lot of good reviews about the book maybe i missed something
f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what 's his name gives them and remember , this doctor , is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives , so why do you \? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life
this book shows how robert has been lying all along he talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless ok then , how did robert make the monthly payment \? why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a porsch as a bum \? this guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses he is a conman and a good one thats why hes a motivational speaker it takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money do n't fall for this conman ! this book contradicts what robert has been preaching in previous books robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless that would be odd but it is n't odd because robert is a professional liar
this was the first book by danielle steele that i have read and it will be the last i read by her i was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over rated author the story was very drawn out and i caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring if you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo
i have very mixed feelings about this book and ca n't say i enjoyed it all that much i love the story of sappho , what little is known of it , and so i picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism , research , and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of lesbos but monsters \? centaurs \? i mean , the story of sappho 's life is not the story of the odyssey and for the life of me i do n't understand why author erica jong decided to give her readers a combination of greek heroine and clash of the titans
i usually enjoy ms maron 's deborah knott books very much the characters are well drawn and give deep insight into southern life this one , however , is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional the first murder does n't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just there the second one involving dwight 's son \( who is a very poorly developed child character \) and his ex wife is not very interesting
i 've read a lot of the books in the series , and hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers , but i have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries my main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author his well crafted mysteries almost always hold water , but not this one i whole heartedly recommend most of hillerman 's other jim chee joe leaphorn novels , but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill , this is not the book to pick up
the story was slow , predictable and boring i am still amazed i hung in there and finished reading it it 's a dud in my opinion
the sub header to this book could very well be all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
one ca n't be sure that this book is n't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad , that if this were n't crappy , it would n't sell even for someone who believes in csik 's theory of flow , this book is a no win blow out instead of making clear statements backed by evidence , the book 's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions there is no reason to read this , when his original popularization , flow , more carefully and clearly summarizes csikszentmihalyi 's interesting research
i was expecting a substitute for the classic photoshop channel chops by monroy and friends it trivializes the subject with how to unlock the hidden power of channels blah blah
i do n't get the impression from reading the book that the authors have even tried to analyzed the financial holdings that was set up it is the thinnest book on enron that i read , for very good reason
the storyline is way over the top , the plot is very poor , the red neck america knows best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying still , i 've red worse books but not many
having read clive cussler adventures for over 10 years , i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book the father , who does not stay with his son , decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else 's country that is perfectly justified !
i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character \? people are just too different , too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history , socio economic patterns , religion , family , etc but the specific results are just that , specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page myself , i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you
i agree with one the comments posted below the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one dimensional character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him over the course of the book he does n't change , he 's unsympathetic , and by the time we 've reached page 500 , we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10 i found myself dying to get to the end of this book , just so i could start another book with some substance and some well drawn characters
you 'd be better off using the internet to figure the game out the guide feels super cluttered , it 's almost hard to read and it does n't tell you everything at the right time i think it feels cluttered because there 's too many pictures in it every page has at least 7 or 8 images on it the best thing about the guide is the production value but i did n't buy for that
book is out of date with modern economic thought essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets
really not sure why this book received such good reviews , because it had nothing new expected from the cover some reviews of outfits worn by different individuals pictured
if you have n't read anything on e commerce at all , or if you 're a total newbie , the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business for someone who is already in the business or has already done some research , this book merely repeats a lot of well known tips even then , some of the tips , like in section on affiliate programs , are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic
this book is built around the idea i wish it were true it is true while this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives , if you 're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life \( i e intellectual integrity \) , you 'd be better off buying an introduction to probability
compared to his other superb books , this is one is tedious and boring the overall thesis is a stretch trying to find equivalences between pre industrial \( and pre printing press \) 13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors at a minimum comparing a world in which 90 of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow
bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know the show was much better , you should buy that kwame is much smater and deserved the job i can tell that this book is another promotional tool do n't waste even a cent on this book
my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths i immediately fell in love with the stories , the prose , the poetry , and so went on to buy this complete volume while it is nice to have all borges 's stories in one place , and at a reasonable price , the language does n't really hold up for me the translation is well , not sloppy , but too simple , like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade i have nothing against andrew hurley , but his translation of borges leaves me cold i 'd give borges 5 stars out of 5 , but hurley \? no more than 2
found recipes dated , layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how to is useful , its generally from another era bought gourmet cook book instead
when i bought this book , i did n't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of friedman 's collumns in the times i think friedman is a great author with lots of great insights , but he is n't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as i would have liked in a bunch of detached 750 1000 word segments since the sections are arranged chronologically , there also is n't the opportunity to tie the themes together
the very title for the book i con despite its cleverness , should reveal the lack of any objectivity , or class for that matter , from the authors , jeffrey s young and william l simon
like most great diplomatic moments , successes and failures alike , decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the camp david debacle can appear even then , disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after given the wide interest in the israeli arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations , new works exploring the crucial climax at camp david remain welcome some dismiss mr swisher 's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team , but instead was responsible at camp david only for negotiations that seems to me unfair clayton swisher clearly did considerable leg work to prepare this text sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect
the religion of peace is at it again ! in response to the popes words , muslims all over the world respond with violence , destruction , rage , hatred , burning down buildings , burning papal effigies , issuing fatwas against the pope , and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back wow , such peace from a religion of peace if islam is a religion of peace , then all the guns in the world are pink flowers , and every nuclear bomb , a soft feathery pillow violence for words destruction for speech please ! this is a religion of war , and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america
very little plot , which is boring
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the pre five in a row w our preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother w borderline personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's what so ever \( if i need a break away , she hunts down my poor husband , all my relatives and friends ugh \) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality
aside from the 1958 championship game and the 1968 super bowl , the actual football games got very short shrift the 1964 championship game did n't even get a mention ! whole years are virtually ignored very , very little discussion of unitas' career and his impact on the game mostly just anecdotes about family , friends , and teammates , and way too much space devoted to post mortem comments from same i think i learned way more about johnny sample and gino marchetti and jim parker from this book than i learned about unitas and that 's not saying much there 's a lot of padding in this book but precious little information and a lot of the anecdotes will be familiar if you 're a football fan wait for the paperback if you 're a unitas devotee otherwise do n't bother
this is the first book by shaara i have read and , if his other works are like this , it is also the last
this book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos hispanics however it 's primarily philisophical it 's more confusing than inspiring it 's great for those studying for a phd , but will not inspire average latinos to action this book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view , although a few writers do express some pan latino thoughts
j k rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way
the premise of this story started off smartly i was drawn in as a reader as case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away but from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time case takes the predictable rout finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache
keynes was no doubt an influential economist his theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post new deal economic policies of the united states and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like imf however , his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the u s particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation \( an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to keynesism \) we have keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government read planning for freedom or socialism by ludwig von mises instead
i was really disappointed with this book a lot of the recipes are identical to one another , with just one ingredient eg a different type of vegetable substituted with no pictures and not much more content , i really regret buying it
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels , and because i'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there
lies , half truths , spin and glitz of course there is some truth sprinkled in self promoting tv stars are more interested in being self promoting tv stars than truth theres just not enough time for both at best it 's entertainment , at worst it misleads the children and finally they are all biblically illiterate so be careful especially with tbn
because you wait and wait , and then three do n't turn up at once
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
wright presents no new information about al qaeda , leaves out plenty of information about al qaeda and neglects the usa side of the road to 9 11 understanding qutb 's radicalization of islam is important to understanding why ayman al zawahiri and usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the usa found a use for them as an enemy what cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the united states by the neoconservatives and followers of leo strauss the united states is not a unique and beautiful snowflake the liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by strauss as destructive of the society of the usa and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about us exceptionalism after the the soviet union was kicked out of afghanistan , both qutb and strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it since the cold war the us has been working off of the friend and enemy model of policy formulated by carl schmitt and 9 11 presented the us with what schmitt called a state of exemption if you think jihad was the cause of 9 11 , ask yourself why richard clarke found bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to iraq hours after 9 11 see the bbc documentary , the power of nightmares or from secularism to jihad sayyid qutb and the foundations of radical islamism by adnan a musallam or the political ideas of leo strauss by shadia drury for a better analysis of qutb and strauss than wright has in his book if you prefer to stick with fiction about the road to 9 11 , check out patrick s johnston 's novel mission accomplished
if you 've read one gary null book , you 've read them all he is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject , but when i buy two books with different titles by gary null and find they are the same , i'm pretty annoyed his early books were taken directly from herbert sheldon 's natural hygience material , which i assume must not have been copyrighted , and i felt ripped off then , in the 70 's as i did recently when amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books
unfortunately , instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis , justifications , and problems with overarching property rights , delong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists delong covers some of the same ground as congressman richard pombo in his 1996 this land is our land , simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions delong 's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill founded delong 's politics overcome his analysis this book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions \( \) his political agenda overwhelm his rational
this was certainly not one of cornwell 's best works it was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one it read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel
this book really irritated me i loved mayes 's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one the concept , a year of traveling to different locations , seemed like it would be really interesting combined with mayes' fresh perspectives , enthusiasm for discovery , feisty opinions and poetic descriptions but somehow it did n't work
the work of a 12 year old without talent phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy , inappropriate similies story line is absurd if this were koontz 's first novel , no publisher would touch it
hateful liberals once again undermine their so called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the us population they claim to be tolerant and open minded toward all lifestyles , religions , races etc but that open mindedness obviously should n't apply to people who disagree with them throughout the book , moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people if you like this book , i also recommend mein kampf by adolf hitler both books are jam packed full of hate
who published these weak translations \? yup , they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper \? b needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality
i bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers let me be candid what the hell were they reading \? this book is simply insipid , implausible and a waste of time get this for a premise rich , geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the connecticut nutmegs ! nutmegs for a major league team \? \? ! ! yeah , right it gets better he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the c list movies he produces ok hold on to your seats , here comes the good part she is going to be his star player on this major league baseball team ! ! why , because in college she was an excellent athlete so some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball ! ! am i the only one who thinks this is plain stupid oh , yeah there 's a murder along the way parker \( author \) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise i ca n't think of a reason why it got published
having read the millionaire next door , as well as most if not all of the classics in this category , i expected life altering experiences with this book
most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page the books of richard dawkins , whom rose selects as his special target , illustrate this well readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain how one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts \? yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in rose 's book there is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions , but almost no observations from behavioural biology nonetheless , in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments , dismissing dawkins and daniel dennett as people who either no longer do science or never did it what a pity , therefore , that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book there are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave , and that 's about it
the first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that , the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book i think the story would have been more credible if barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it without those details , the book seemed unfinished it was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain boring in my opinion
i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character \? people are just too different , too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history , socio economic patterns , religion , family , etc but the specific results are just that , specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page myself , i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you
it has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed the canadian eskimo dog is now referred to as the canadian inuit dog out of respect for the inuit people he has the dog 's height wrong , and the weight range is much too high this leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed , who 's to say that it 's not wrong on other breeds too \?
two main comments firstly , the book is mistitled or i misread the meaning of the title and i would be delighted to return it this is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform tricks with much on showmanship i have no interest in that but i do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master 's care of their puppy and mature dog problems handlers encounter in greeting of your dog with other dogs and people
i 've read only a few of hillerman 's previous leaphorn chee novels i 've enjoyed what i 've rtead , though they are an acquired taste , and i do n't indulge in them very often i tend to enjoy the earlier , more active years of joe leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi retired unofficial advisor to jim chee' phase
this book is 'oragnized' into sections getting started , organizing room by room , organizing finances , organizing time , organizing home life , and organizing transitions
i like looking at old pictures and old letters , but i thought when i bought the book that i would actually be looking in the history of someone 's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case it is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book the pictures are n't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters , so you know nothing of the authors , no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything in other words , no story behind it whatsoever just a disappointing collection
in my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels , i came across this interesting find summer of 2005
i will be brief penroses writing is mediocre , his drawings obfuscate more than clarify
perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out , but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie the story involves brain surgery gone bad , with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control the end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as i suspected from the very beginning of the book
many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable \( i happened to be 13 when i read it \) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault
this was a less than stellar sequal to the women of the silk but it did finish the story of pei to some extent i found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believabl
the story was slow , predictable and boring i am still amazed i hung in there and finished reading it it 's a dud in my opinion
the title grabbed me because i have been noticing for , oh about 14 years now , the decline of the truth in this country unfortunately , this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is \( definition of irony i believe \)
who better to write a book about morons than flynn \? an abyssmally miserable book with so little substance i was surprised it did n't float out of my hands it 's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic two wrongs do n't make a right , non sequiturs galore , red herrings they 're all there
i wanted to like this book it 's a great size for carrying around to dip into however , i 'd say about a third , or maybe more , i have n't counted , are anonymous here 's an example life is filled with possibilities p31 now i do n't know about you , but i 'd hardly class that as great stuff from great minds then i read decide what is worthwhile and follow through with it and i'm beginning to yawn when i came to above all , life should be fun and always keep a window open in your mind for new ideas and i'm just about ready to throw the book into the garbage also , the format of the book is terrible someone decided to put every quote into a little frame , so you get four quotes on a page
the kite runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up , stay focused , and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i remember reading the chamber distinctly somehow , this book doesnt even near that standard the story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns the characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out
uldrich makes big bucks on the public speaking circuit discussing nanotechnology i suspect this book was published for no other reason than to provide some credentials to support the speaking engagements his most recent books published since this one have been one about george marshall and another about lewis and clark real cutting edge technology there ! nope , do n't buy it
the ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book it was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real ludlum books
i have been a devoted hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical , the story is just so silly i found it hard to keep my attention focused i compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which i do with my children on occasion sorry , i just could n't finish it
i wavered awhile between three stars and two stars , because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as sony and akio morita seem to deserve at least three however , in the end , the book 's errors just piled too high it opens well , with the story of sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half wrecked department store just after world war ii , to becoming one of the world 's great companies this is a fascinating and inspiring story , and morita tells it with flair
joshua 6 23 , 21 joshua said to the people of israel , the lord has given you the city of the all silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord
i was more upset with this book than anyother i 've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing
galbraith 's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure his ideas are sound , though he has a very off putting pompous delivery in fact , his verbosity and poor structure is so bad , that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind numbing experience the book really needs to go back to an editor
mr galbraith is smart , accomplished , and learned man who knows what is best for all us his view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling , mr galbraith aims to be `practical' and just further defines the third way nonetheless , his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the european model of society many of his proposals are so silly you wo n't take them seriously but sadly , he is quite serious for example , mr galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life of course , he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding neither does he address what one should do if their life is un rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life and , of course , who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone \( who has a life that is deemed too rewarding \) for someone who has life that is too un rewarding mr galbraith fails to convince the reader of the practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between socialism and capitalism , and saying nothing new
even the avid trekie reader of the star trek science fiction novels , movies and television series must suspend disbelief , when he finds captain kirk saying beam me up , scotty but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort , when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world wide rapture though the characters and their roles are fictitious , the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer
my problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages ! we did n't notice it until book 4 of 6 , but 80 pages were gone ! now , amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed up set this is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages !
while the author rehashes some basic business writing theory , she consistently fails to follow her own rules
if you walk into b and flip through \( not even buy ! \) the other well known recommended pregnancy books you 'll get much more information than what douglas offers
hmm , quite a disappointment , especially after splurging on the hardcover edition set as a kind of rockies rear window , this is one slow story endless pages of crazy making when i 'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through finally skipped ahead to finish the book i had really looked forward to angels fall , too \( if you are a roberts fan , do n't spend the money on the hardcover , wait for the paperback , go to the library , or borrow from a friend not worth the price
there were several good scenes , but they did n't make up for the rest of the book not worth reading
this book was easy enough to read , it just was n't what i expected from quindlen i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating , in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out the back and forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing , and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past , whereas the previous paragraph was present time although i got used to that writing style , i always found it annoying the storyline itself never sold me either a typical , young sew your wild oats boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the perfect father i just did not find such an occurrence likely and , as a mother myself , all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm anyway the whole story seemed far fetched and disjointed to me , and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many , many years
just awful
i was recommended borges' works by one of his innumerable over educated sycophants and i will never forget the tremendous time i wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life 's work \( when i should have been writing my dissertation \) each time i read one of his pedantic , mediocre peices of short fiction , i was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that i would like other examples of his work if i continued reading since all of his stories are so unique i found the exact opposite to be true one story after another about mazes , mirrors , mystical mathematical formulas and books , books , books the ideas were transperant , the language boring in the extreme his poetry is trite who needs this \? borges reads like a petulant graduate student at university of chicago who failed repeatedly to get his her short fiction published in the atlantic monthly particularly among academics , literary elites and like people , many seem to cite borges and worship his genius more than read him and certaintly no one reads him critically i read most of his work , and i can tell you , outside of a few interesting turns of phrase , you 'd be better off reading a yale dissertation on the semiotics of self superiority people incessantly talk about how imaginative borges is the vast majority of popular sf and fantasy writers are more imaginative even many of the despicable magical realist geniuses make borges look rather plain borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of manhattan or cambridge if you 're this kind of pompous fellow , you 'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of luis by your side and a series of mirrors , as it were , slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans substantiation with this benighted old librarian if you 're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters , enjoying nuanced use of language , and grasping subtle , daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter , run far , far away from jorge luis borges even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews the adulation of borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among \( those who think themselves \) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction i think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment , relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams , and not an example of literary genius in that sense , 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work , and that 's about as much attention as he deserves
i read exactly half the book and stopped based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending , that was a good decision as it is there went hours of my life i wo n't get back ! the book is silly and laughable the premise sounded great but the book is bad really bad
i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly there are a lot of good books out there , dan harrington 's the very best , but this isnt one of them too much ego here and not enough helpful information
i use the notebook and a walk to remember as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses , i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer , i was more satisfied with the rescue taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl , etc , etc ,
ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality to her there is no middle ground i am an educated , well travelled adult who while born in the united states , spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded to be called a communist , a traitor , and an enemy of america just because i do n't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on
the is by far the weakest grisham novel i 've ever read the first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist \( joel backman more about him later \) wanders italy for nearly 200 pages , learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with italian carictatures that would make chico marx cringe when grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense , it 's all for naught , as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending
not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected i did n't really connect with the main characters i was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects \( the lights \) it seemed like a mystery love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story
if the kranks really did what they set out to do and skip christmas , that would have been a good story the end
you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library
it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat , then do n't waste your time
what a disappointment ! based on reviews , i could n't wait to get this book do n't let the 48 pages fool you half of the pages are pictures , and the half with writing on them are double spaced with wide margins took me all of 20 minutes to read \( and only that long because of all the page turning \) nothing wrong with being concise except that the philosophy here is overly simplified quindlen goes to great lengths to equate pefection with conformity and condemning it as inauthentic i do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves \( i e , wanting to be the perfect mother , perfect daughter , perfect wife , perfect businesswoman \) therefore , it creates warm , fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being boring unfortunately , to claim that well behaved women do n't make good lawyers or businesswomen just does n't follow this is not deep reading 20 minutes \? do n't waste your time
my understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus , the information age \( which starts with the network society \) if this is so , i am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy this is a really bad piece of sociology , characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis why did i give it two stars instead of one then \? well , it does have some ok parts catsell 's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism he also presents some convincing data \( gathered by other people \) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on line world , alienating them from the world of face to face interaction this happens in the case of a few troubled people , but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off line relationships the rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image , with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology this is , frankly , ludicrous reductionism it does n't even stand up to a simple test of chronology a lot of the developments that castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid 1990s as castells himself admits , businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene , and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements on top of this , castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked , whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations i'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena castells does see some of the problems with the new network society loss of job security and the digital divide , for instance but he tends to downplay these and his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same more internet access , more network social organization talk about a narrow vision
this novel would be better suited for the stage it reads like a play , often
please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are i hated this book it took me at least 6 months to read this because i could not force myself to read it but that being said i also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that i had looked at some reviews and realized that was what i was getting myself into i read 'as i lay dying' in high school and hated it too there is no plot , and no point i hated it
it still amazes me that anyone takes gould seriously he is an admitted marxist , and he allows his social beliefs to influence science that is not science science is a dispasionate search for the truth i get the feeling reading this book that gould does n't like what the truth is , so he wants to shape the way we see the truth they used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun
j k rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers there are so many open ends in the story chartacters are not distinctly outlined tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
woolf 's style of writing \( changing between several characters' thoughts \) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio the paperback proved to be easier for me
this book is not what i thought i bought i was expecting information useful to left handers instead i found out why society belives left handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed i enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book by the way , it was written by a right handed person
when i picked up true believer , i was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters neither panned out this book is boring the characters are one dimensional and there is no mystery too much detail and not enough substance not sure what the point of the story was as i did n't get it
this book proves once again , that you do n't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market true believer is an all star team of cheap , shallow cliches there is no plot no one really believes anything , and everything is a contrived , superficial mish mash the dialoge has no depth , and when you 've had too much dialoge , there 's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters , thinking to themselves wow , is this bad message in a bottle was a great plot idea , but its been a slow , steady descent since then you might have a good laugh at it like i did , but otherwise i was very disappointed
i have 50 pages to go and i ca n't wait to finish this boring waste of time very predictable , sappy , sweet and quite meaningless i give it a minus 1
the number poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom , even if it is a number eisenberg 's number is the inverse of that draw down , or twenty five times well , there 's the rub , twenty five times what \? income \? expenses \? income less savings \? projected discretionary spending \? post mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses \? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants , experts , philosophers , and casual acquaintances eisenberg , a former esquire editor and short timer with lands end , ruminates about a simple question how much money do you need to feel secure \? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms happiness , comfort , excess consumption , ego and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be constructing a one year budget is hard enough constructing a thirty year budget is nearly impossible
this is , without question , the worst book ever written on one 's financial life to begin with , it 's useless zero information , zero new analysis of old information , zero advice , zero interesting anecdotes additionally , it 's rambling meandering from summaries of old data , to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel good blathering what exactly is this guy 's point \? no way to tell
this book has a lot of names i 'll give it that but , there are some relatively common names that are missing and so many invented names my favorite of the invented names are schmoopie and poogie as if these names will show up on a birth certificate ! !
i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow , what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list
the trouble starts early there is an apologetic preamble which states that the author \( s \) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community this is an enormous assumption about the general public 's knowledge both of video games and more so it 's history of design many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the tv spinoffs , most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look \( ed \) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment
if you are a man , you will not like this collection of feminist essays this book is worse than bad it is an abomination
this is the book dan brown 's bestseller the da vinci code is based on indeed , michael baigent et al have even sued brown in court , charging him with plagiarizing their book the ideas behind the da vinci code have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians obviously , this exposure affects holy blood , holy grail as well
eve dallas is a cop in the future , chasing drug dealers , killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of eve 's rich husband and ends up dead i hated this book , the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags
much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white or male for that matter though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each a not terribly risky venture , this
buy a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do instead snortland 's book is more of a feminist 's political treastise on how males and females are raised and nurtured versus a pragmatic approach on skills to identify potential threats and strategies to deal with them she does hype impact training which sounds like a beneficial program i bought it for my daughter , but read it first actually , i tried to read it halfway through the book i decided to toss it
although i really do like ripley 's writing and her stories , this one was shameful what she did to the memory of gwtw i have to blame this on the editors scarlett was not the colorful character as in gwtw in this so called sequel publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic
this is a revolutionary book it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology all of social interaction is a performance on a stage it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement the language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated there are some problems with clarity and structure the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me no sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book so if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start \( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction \)
i'm surprised that someone so seemingly intelligent does not know that stories and specific examples are what make a book interesting this book was totally devoid of them , but instead used vague generalizations from beginning to end i read the whole book and was waiting for it to get good it never did do n't waste your time or your money any positive review must have been written by the author 's friends i would rather eat cardboard that read this book again
i do not think the man who translated the koran here is a true muslim one cannot shuffle and reorder the suras to suit one 's own taste this man does not have the right to mess up our holy book in this way plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the ali version i have not been in a mosque yet that had this version of the koran on its shelves you can go into any mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the ali tranlation for free why waste your money on this infidel sham version \?
i would love to read a neutral book on barry bonds , i hate cheerleader type books about players but i also hate one sided ones as well the only good things he really has to say about bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous marge \( whom he then sarcastically remarks that bonds was only her second favorite player \)
i was disappointed with this purchase if you read the book jacket , you have gotten about all of the information out of it that 's coming
wow , i was expecting a fun , light read , and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to mishaps that happen to animals in zippy 's life well , i thought , next chapter will be better not the next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels ! every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it ! if you are sensitive to these things , i would not recommend the book i'm not sure i'm going to finish it at this rate granted , i am super sensitive to any animal suffering , but this is really overload i'm halfway through and so far this is the list the aforementioned chicken slaughter , a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement , another neighbor looking to poison her cat , dog sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later , her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred zippy 's pet chicken , joking about a neighbor enjoying puppy stew , keeping her two dogs penned up , torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds i mean , does that seem like a lot to you \? \? \? for a light hearted tender memoir \? \? \? \? jeez louise ! i ca n't sleep at night from this book
i picked this book up after reading both books in the bartimeus trilogy and was excited to see what else jonathan stroud could conjure up this book was a let down i just could n't get into the plot i even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie , especially for young children to read there are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci fi novel , rather than a book marketed for children and young teens the characters were unlikeable , and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention i was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing bartimeus trilogy books ! well , i figured i would add my two cents in and let people know i just did n't like this book
i have to preface this by saying that i absolutely love eating at the candle so delicious
do n't be excited about this book 's small size and light weight , the text needs more examples to support you while doing homework breif chapter explantions caused me to nearly fail my class was not a gret book , in fact many students complained to the dean regarding this book good luck

all over the place
you have to ask yourself , why did william grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary \? as you read the book , the answer comes quickly , before you 're even very far into the a 's apparently he did n't
i had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism instead i got a diatribe against western liberalism lee harris is the poster child for the modern john birchers , people who believe our way is not only the best way , its the only way in an increasingly global economic and political system , his view of the world can be said to be outmoded , at best quaint , at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years , we will need tolerance and inclusivness
i enjoy this work , lots of fresh observations and connections but having read it in the light of recent trends in the e biz world , it sounds thin and delusional a lot like tom peters after way too much espresso there are consequences from continually embracing change and , in my experience all of them are bad i wonder on what real world experience mr kelly bases his thinking my advice , embrace chaos and change , but do it very carefully because it will definitely have consequences truth beauty ! bv
the only explanation is that james paterson churned this dog out to make a buck i 've read a number of james patterson books and while i'm not a hard core fan , i 've enjoyed most of them i know this will outrage some patterson readers but i'm not much of a fan of alex cross who frankly i find boring as hell
not his best book , i thought waldo lost in new york is more authoritive i mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant , when he ca n't even rely on himself
mark twain once said that \( and i paraphrase \) the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read that is my experience with this book for some reason , a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists , and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt so i picked it up what a slog ! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton , a character who you barely get to know , and root for lucie manette the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge an admittedly cool concept maybe this book speaks to another era , maybe it 's past its prime , maybe i do n't have the required literary sensibilities , or maybe i could n't relate , but a tale of two cities bored me to tears
while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife i'm very tender when it comes to wildlife , and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle , i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos , then this is not the book for them otherwise , i would recommend it
i saw this book at a friend 's shortly after seeing the movie i asked her if i could borrow it she said i would n't want to she 'd been trying to read it for awhile , and did n't like it i decided to try anyway unfortunately , my friend was right this is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book i really liked the movie however , the book is too long and boring there are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story i ca n't believe i even finished it rent the movie do n't waste your time on the book
while this is a well researched and thought provoking piece of literature , i do have some critical comments to make
there are two things which tickle me about this book one is the sample zack 's report at the back which has a strong buy 1 rating on a 3 return on equity stock the other is the section on practical use of the system it , of course , is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 3 months and do n't forget about growth investors and value investors either this section is so short as to be laughable also notice that in the 2002 a list there were 216 stocks most are going to have to buy a subset but what subset \? no info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class perhaps an mvo addict or a monte carlo hack would have the answer
i zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that the main character just goes on a big , boring sight seeing tour it reminded me of that show on the travel channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design there is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it 's very short lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings i 've ever read the book just stops not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel
this book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms , bubbles , and busts
this is truly a disappointing book it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels \( 1 \) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl \( the young female protagonist in the hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality \) , \( 2 \) devoted , super powered canine companions , \( 3 \) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped out rvs , and \( 4 \) evil bioethicists
mcknight 's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate , but disturbingly overstated in this book
from reading danielle steel here 's the book three bachelors meet three women they all break up , they all end up happily ever after boring , not one single exciting thing about this book i was happy when my lunch break ended so i could go back to work and stop reading
while this book contains a ton of data , do n't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade if you look up french toast , for example , it only gives information on name brand items much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products i suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping , or use it before eating out , it would be helpful but if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items , you are out of luck with this book
while entertaining , i found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money while probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed i also found the timeline hard to believe maybe because i have lived in the area and understand the distances \( and traffic \) travelled in short periods of time i am a big elizabeth lowell fan \( as well as ann maxwell \) but this was not one of her better books
i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature some of the pages were blank , having not even been printed i figure the book was a total loss of money spent
gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics in fact i did n't like science and i had no mathematical aptitude
my first grisham novel , and it reminded me of why i seldom read fiction the plot has numerous barely believable twists , the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist 's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility said lawyer then drives from memphis to new orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid 's mere suggestion absurd ! no attorney in his her right mind would do such a thing !
i was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of chicago i had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting , but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names the plot is trite as are most of the characters characters change their stripes at the drop of a hat the book has a certain fairy tale , and they lived happily ever after quality that i found really disconcerting i would have been more satisfied if dean \( the main character \) had turned out to be an ax murderer ! just kidding of course or am i \? if you can pick this book up used for a couple of bucks , okay but do n't you pay a penny more
i ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that i would learn something about familiars in the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about ms little had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an owl \? had she entertained a hyrax or a feral cat as a house guest \? had she ever had a pet bat living behind a picture in the living room \? was she acquainted with the properties of henbane and twylight sleep and did she number hecate among her close friends \? the kindest thing , i thought was to suggest that ms little knew as much about familiars as i know about conveyancing or futures trading , and let it go at that
now that hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation
i am a teacher at an inner city school that struggles with the same issues presented by kozol that said , this is the fourth of kozol 's works that i have read , and i came away just as disappointed with the shame of the nation as i did with the rest of them i am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education he acts like we do n't already know he acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it , why does n't he use his experience and know it all knowledge to offer real , concrete and practical solutions \? kozol is a classic monday morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing but he does n't get his hands dirty anymore if he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is , the least he could do is offer some solutions i 've made four mistakes i will not make a fifth i have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach , and i ca n't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious
what a disastrously bad and unfunny novel the self involved main character is pathetic and whiny , the plot is see through and cliched , and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog
prof gardner 's book is disappointing he tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first also , his language is inflated , and lacking in philosopical specificity for example , he believes in building up the inner world of mental representations unexplained term yet insists on performances of understanding another unexplained term
becoming a master manager , the textbook currently used in my introduction to management class , does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management the book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager , and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role while i appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject , i do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow the reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency , and while meant well , they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper furthermore , becoming a master manager stresses models and theories of management that i find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management , which are not adequately presented in the textbook some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth , but in a more advanced level of business management and while becoming a master manager is the official textbook for my management class , i have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information , and only the eve of a test do i bother to look over becoming a master manager , i do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all
i'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with however , my public library has a limited selection of audio books , so i take what i can get i am a voracious reader , and i listen to audios to get more reading in , as you can listen and do other things i much prefer the lillian jackson braun cat books , at least there is some humor , and i like the mystery part of these books better than deaver 's sorry to all the deaver fan 's out there i have enjoyed a few of his books , but i get tired of the same ole same ole
i bought this book because it was listed with ellen miller 's like being killed , a brilliant and complex book about a woman 's love affair with heroin , her best friend susie , and her best friend 's duplicitous hiv positive boyfriend the protagonist herself was brilliant and complex so naturally , i expected the same thing out of swimming sweet arrow man , was i disappointed this was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman 's masochistic sex life , pathetic obsession with brutal men , and pathetic quest for attention her entire life is a meta existence rather than desiring , she desires to be desired rather than enjoying , she enjoys being enjoyed the male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who did n't exhibit the most common stereotypes in her world , all men are sensation craving brutes , and all women are attention craving doormats the men want drugs , fun , and sex , and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing not the drugs , not the sex , just being a victim due to the attention it provides this book made me really miserable to be perceived as part of this gender
i have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more the language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words these books can cause you embaesment , since i read where ever i have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it please we would all like to see more of these
on the plus side , this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises i was very excited at first , but unfortunately none of the exercises , massages , meditations , etc i tried seemed to help any of my health problems , even after a month the book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury , yet leaves me crying in disappointment i will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile , but i do n't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point
this is a nice enough board book , but be advised that it is not the full version of dr seuss' book ! they 've left out several \( charming ! \) pages of text and illustrations for the board book what a disappointment to loyal fans , and how unfair to the newest generation of fans to be
for decades , many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students to the fury of feminists to read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating
this book was suggested reading as if the great secret to personal freedom was going to be revealed it spoke of a self centered mindset that seemed to suggest that i was to live my life how i wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me a very simplistic and selfish point of view
i read a good short story by franzen in the new yorker a couple years ago , but this book is lame , lame , lame the essays contain little to no humor or insight they are just lengthy , boring opinions on various subjects imagine if you can a duller , less relavant andy rooney if i wanted to read some loser 's uninspired musings , i would get on the internet and start reading weblogs i hereby declare this book unreadable
sorry for the sarcastic title i 've read most of this book i'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter
this is my 3rd mcdermid novel , i previously read 'mermaids singing' and 'wire in the blood ' mcdermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel i see dangerous repetitions in character types which , if repeated in the next tony hill carol jordan book will make that one my last purchase generally mcdermid paints female police officers as brighter , more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts , as well as more often homosexual the men , with the exception of leading man tony hill , are mostly all egotistical , back stabbing , power hungry morons of the lowest order , while hill is rendered impotent a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber the slow mating dance between hill and jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff and in this book , the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as dr hill the emotional connection between hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here , making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought and the real villain not the serial killer but a drug pushing illegal immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer the climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger i was extremely disappointed with this book
was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free
while this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others , in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers do n't exist i 'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality , but just how far can we take this kind of analysis \? the author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same sex parent , he can determine the birth order of your ideal match my father was 3rd and i was 2nd , thus i should pair with a 4th born anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo science there are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions not every nth born is the same , and no relationship between nth and mth borns can be analysed this way as with astrology , the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong sign who 's to say i wo n't get along with a 2nd born \? rather than relying on voodoo like this , we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals
i was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real life situations i felt most of the book talked about how to parent , i e cosleeping , wearing baby , etc , but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation what do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when i pick him up \? i do n't want to spank , but a 24 month old just does n't take to a talk or timeout like dr sears says he should the sears birth book was amazing , i recommend it to anyone , but this book did not help me answer my questions
i'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely there evidence even trying very hard to be generous \( hey , i'm a christian and i think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true \) , i think i could poke a hole in every page and that 's after perhaps 12 months of formal mandarin study and a similar amount of cantonese
of paradise and power by robert kagan
i suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda that being said , in this book , mr dilorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts \( or at least with his conclusions \)
yuk ! ! ! worst book i 've ever read i read alot and with alot of variety this book stinks \( too farfetched , retched , disgusting and plain weird \)
the book is brilliant , no question about it his stories are great , his humor dry and culturally insightful the problem is that , like all audio books , the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience and in this case , unfortunately , the voice of the author fails the material
dr gray must be a wonderful lover as a woman i read his hints and suggestions for a man 's love making technique and marvel at his insight i truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom however there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover by maintaining a position of gallant ladies first mentality he , in truth , is demeaning the power of women 's sexuality
my 60s something father gave me this book i am a 45 year old middle class man with a 6 year old son using my wife 's account i do n't understand for whom this book is written it is full of painfully obvious advice such as do n't play with your food or do not throw golf clubs in anger anyone raised in america \( presuming that is the author 's intended audience \) who does n't already understand these things and take them to heart is n't going to be interested in reading about them in a book , if they can even read chapter 15 deals with staring and differences where the author admonishes do not repeat racist , sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence if you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this if you are , this book is n't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it i found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet if the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated , dream on ! i think the author has a professor henry higgins jones i am also concerned about my father 's opinion of me , i mean do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store duh
the publishers should be sued maybe we should get a class action together
i concur with another reviewer get luigi gambero 's mary and the fathers of the church , and , i might add , his follow up work , mary in the middle ages read these two books alongside truly our sister , then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic , historically contiguous development of the church 's marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the church has ever produced including bridget of sweden , or johnson 's glib , 21st century , feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment
i had high hopes when i picked up this book because styron is a terrific writer and i was interested in the subject by the time i was done i nearly threw it across the room admittedly , depression makes for a tough topic , but that 's not good enough
as someone very interested in urban exploration \( especially in the subways \) i wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it after reading many of these amazon reviews though , i opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my bronx library instead thank goodness as i only wasted valuable time , and not any money
sue grafton has written many good books but this one is weak , weak , weak try 'a is for alibi' or 'j is for judgement' they show off grafton 's writing talents much better
not that i do n't like shakespeare 's works , but his tragedies are terrible , especially this one i ca n't understand the language real well , so i have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it 'll be easier to understand i just ca n't understand this love tragedy at all ! here are some things that confuse me
i wanted to cry when i put this book down because i miss the danielle steele that wrote 'thurston house' , 'family circle' and others for years now i have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers i really feel like her heart just is n't in it anymore she has become very idiosyncratic and predictable every book has her main character 'being honest ' i keep reading because i am a loyal danielle steele fan and i write this in hopes she 'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it \( like she once did \) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works this book was just awful
i received this book as a gift i was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as bob novak and sean hannity have n't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book \? no and with good reason it 's not a history book , it 's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk the faithful out of their hard earned dollars
yet another offering from the kinkade art product assembly line pass on this read real books and buy real art instead
this is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you do n't have faith in the supernatural , you have no reason for hope
as a certified information systems security professional , i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here , and i'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it
like many others in my book group , i had been looking forward to finally reading something by pamuk and like most of my book group , i was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him originally published in turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one faruk darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive he then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't this should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes even more so if the reader knows that darvinoglu is the protagonist of pamuk 's earlier book the house of silence such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of calvino , borges , and their ilk
sorry , but i found this book a total waste of time i never did like the main character i found her boring ! i laughed out loud when i read another reviewer say that this person escaped her life to be a secretary \? good point ! it was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really and to continue this new life without really taking time to search her soul instead she befriends even more boring people than herself as far as the ending of the book goes i could n't have cared less what happened to her anyway ! after reading it \( book on tape \) i felt i had totally wasted my time what a disappointment
the author comes off as a whining , unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment further apalled by the church founder 's belief , in that it \( the worlwide church of god \) was god 's true church through the ages , right on up to the present 'end time' feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert w armstrong , the church 's actual teachings , and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult' and further damning its pastor general as a heretic , despite the church 's humanitarian works , publishing , colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of h w armstrong since armstrong 's death in 1986 , feazell and his cohort joseph tkach jr seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days , sabbaths , ten commandments \( which , in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions' \) and general lifestyle of this 7th day church of god denomination mr feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership , as over 100 , 000 members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states and continuing the legacy and apostolic , traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert w armstrong in 1927
this is yet another book where anyone who passed a high school bio class will know is crap he seems to have found a devoted crew of morons who believe that he really can cure all if you ever go to one of their conventions , you 'll know that its amway for stupid soccer moms with allergic kids
john katzenbach is an accomplished author and i had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels \( the analyst \) , so i was surprised at how bad the shadow man was the premise of the plot is that four very old jewish people , survivors of the holecaust , believe they have seen the shadow man the shadow man was a jew who joined forces with the nazis to find jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps these four old people feared the shadow man more than anything when one of them is killed , a retired police detective named simon winter looks into who the shadow man is meanwhile , the miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect
this book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998 ! ! ! totally out of date ! useless ! ! wondering why it is still for sale the author , contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked , simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one outrageaous ! spread the word and if you own the book , get your money back
i have been a huge fan of the anna pigeon mysteries the hard truth about hard truth is skip it it is a very unpleasant experience
jeremy narby 's the cosmic serpent dna and the origins of knowledge , started out decently enough with narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the amazon basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding dna and serpent myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of intelligent design and makes an all out attack on darwinian evolution and science itself
she wastes the first chapters , and my time , going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who does n't deserve to be hired would use it adds to the drama and despair i suppose , but it comes off as contrived , and as an attempt to pander to her extremist pessimist reading coterie
i fail to understand all of the hoopla about susan sontag while i have only read a limited selection of her work , in these essays , against interpretation being the ultimate example , sontag emerges as a simple minded , arrogant ignoramus in her utterly unreasoned invective , sontag ignores \( or is just unable to understand \) two critical facts first , some works of art and theory are difficult to understand \( in varying degrees \) without the help of interpretation sontag 's flawed analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached new and unheard of misguided heights second , sontag ignores the fact that works of art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language this could n't possibly be clearer than in poetry weinberger 's excellent nineteen ways of looking at wang wei , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference what was she thinking \? the only good aspect of the essay \( and why i give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero \) is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy sontag 's writing
i stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck , all those millions reading gray 's franchise ca n't be wrong plus , i 've seen gray on larry king once , and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy this book , though , promising in its intro to be sexy , touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves now , i am not above accepting bedroom advice where it 's warranted \( for instance , it is thanks to dr gray that i finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we 'd just went to see \) but gray 's generalizations , dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife bonnie were mostly unhelpful , and i suspect that the passages i found funny were involuntarily so
congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades
i have never read one of johansen 's books and after reading this one , i'm not likely to read another i usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but i just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche filled writing exclamations such as dear heaven and lord were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone \( it would suit my southern grandma , however \) as another reviewer said , the big mystery of why daisy would n't leave geneva was n't particularly mysterious if she really wanted jason to leave she could have just told him character development was lacking and i just did n't care that much about them i would have liked to hear more about cynthia and her antics i did finish the book because i was curious to know what happened , but i could n't wait for it to be over sorry , but this was not my cup of tea
and dump it great advice given in a previous review
the author has her narrator \( cinnamon \) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett , in a game of wish fulfillment one upmanship even though she 's calling the shots , as it 's her book , scarlett still comes out miles ahead perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society , but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism even if misplaced just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies , such as ivanhoe presents the story may have been one sided , but it 's the side mm chose to tell , and there 's kernel of truth in the myth of the old south , as in all myths
i found this book extremely verbose and unorganized it would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student but it 's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class the authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student not recommended
the author makes a good case for index mutual funds but there are
for someone who spends his career attacking politically motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science stephen jay gould is a paleontologist evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it

middle aged gracie is a typical hollywood wife , right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe when her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage , gracie finds herself without love , without friends , and most importantly , without status \( but at least she 's still got the money ! \)
i rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it , but i could n't take any more of look homeward , angel after part i \( about 1 3 of the way through \) it was long , rambling , and most of the passages did not add anything to the story , not even in the way of atmosphere i do not recommend this book
as the reviewer from jackhorn , ky stated , this book lacks original research if you read the section on the house church movement and then go to the website for the homechurch homepage , you will see that mr wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his research for the many quotes he used from the website , not once were any of the authors contacted by mr wolfe in order to do any original research if he had done so , he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book
bought book flipped through for 5 minutes , found good use starting a woodfire all the info contained can be had for free on the internet if youve been trading more then 2 days you already know more then the scope of this boo
as a professional , certified chef and baker , i am also an avid baking and cookbook collector after seeing that this book won and the james beard and the 'iacp cookbook of the year' awards both prominently displayed on the cover of this book and after reading the 'too good to be true' reviews on amazon some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if peter reinhart is the jesus christ of bread i finally decided to buy this expensive book
this has been a story of an american soldier whose involvement in the making of the world 's greatest dictionary was singular , astonishing , memorable and laudable and yet at the same time wretchedly sad prologue well , that certainly could have been the story but what it was was a history of the dictionary \( as in the history of the horse \) with w c minor 's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so winchester , the author of several other books i 'll avoid , also seems to suffer from the common malady or unwillingness of not knowing how to end a book so the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into the history of insanity dimentia alzeihmer 's , whatever you want to call what minor suffered whereas i should have shed a tear when the main character assuming it was n't a dictionary was laid to rest at age 85 , i was fairly glad to see him go
as a romantic comedy , star wars is a failure as a science fiction film , the annie hall is a complete disappointment whatever other merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking which brings me to the rough guide to cult movies as a reference book , it is highly suspect what 's notable is that annie hall fails as sci fi because it does n't try to be that genre the rough guide fails at the very category it aspires to which is too bad , because it is often an interesting read
another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation if you dig that sort of thing there are tons out on the market unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers like one would get when reading a book on the occult people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it it is a living when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism or in this case the secret agenda before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad
all i can say is pass me some aspirin this is a dozy of a bad novel as it says on the dust jacket , a supreme court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit at the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for
i must say that after reading this book , i am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between japan and the us
the book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading if you do n't know anything about database marketing , then you will get something out of this book if you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis , loyalty programs and relationship marketing , there is nothing new here in fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is the loyalty effect by reichenheld or customer connections by wayland and cole the subtitle mentions the dot com world , but the book has little to say about the internet the book really does not cover crms \( as oppsed to database marketing \) in that it fails describe how crm systems work and what database , modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them
oh my god ! ! ! ! there is another patricia kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind i thought one patricia was enough but after reading this book , i am faced with the frightening realization that there are two of them !
a rather toothless attempt at rewriting strunk and white , or chicago into fun reference books should n't waste this much space on casual conversation get to the point get elements of style , elements of grammar , and chicago rather than this handbook
this textbook is more useful for the flashy \( and admittedly very good \) teacher 's ancillaries but this review is not for the ancillaries it is for the text itself
the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again i was disappointed , soon after , when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts , with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle and then even that was disappointing i mean graceland for a first date \? i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights , and logan and nate from that same book none of them can talk in complete sentences and stella , who comes across as this loving mother , who puts her kids before anything else , works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she is n't there to oversee everything , even though the place has been successful for years there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband , she just does it unless , of course , it was in the last 50 pages which i did n't bother to read because i just could n't torture myself any longer and i'm a big fan of roberts i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out
this book has taken photo after photo straight out of the ikea catalogue ! obviously , the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to ikea 's design and storage ideas this book actually put me in a bad mood listen up folks , the ikea catalogue is free do yourselves a favour and pick one up , because none of these so called organization books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local ikea store these authors should be fired shame on both of them
not insightful , not even humorous i am willing to admit that maybe i just do n't get his writing style , whatever that might be i hope mr rakoff gets into a new line of wor
ridiculous , convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring
when i reviewed the street lawyer recently , i mentioned that i 've never put down a grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props for that book , certainly for this one , nope i read four chapters , 41 of its 391 pages , and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot i hope he just had an off day or something , and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable
i'm thankful that i was able to get this book at the library and did n't spend 15 00 buying it i own the blue day book by the same author and i think it 's fantastic and it cheers me up right away he should have stopped with that book it claims to be a witty , thought provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who 's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way the only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures it did have one thought that i really liked some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge if that 's true , then why do smart people dress so badly \?
i liked most of jo beverly 's books in fact , she is one of my favorite romance writers that 's why it 's hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived the premise saving an opium addict is good one could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers but no it 's all pretty smooth the passion is tepid and not much else happens a series of rogues from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story and the conversations are so boring that i simply had to skip them i guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core beverly fans

the package the book came in was smashed the book appeared as if it had been used it took over 2 weeks for it to arrive i would n't order any books from amazon agai
spend your money elsewhere for someone who supposedly lives in the vicinity of yellowstone he knows and sees little to anyone who steps outside of the sealed up world of their car and even casually looks , the senses are all brought to life with sights sounds , smells , temperatures , textures and colors cahill does not inform he is not even a very good writer , for if he were , he 'd do the same thing i did , huck the book into the trash go to yellowstone yourself and hang out the windows of your car and even that simple pleasure will tell you how inadequate this book really is
got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad pages are falling out
i recently read i , k , and l in succession compared to innocent and killer , i found lawless to be slow paced \( even though this edition finds kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country \) and the plot twists less surprising with others i 've read in the series , i am usually hooked relatively early in the story line i was 1 3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing \( kinsey has little contact with immediate family , ergo she substitutes others in her life henry , rosie , pitt family , the criminal elements in this book as her family \) i also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in l could be so dim witted on one page , and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next anyway , there are others in this series i would recommend more highly \( m being one of them \)
i had to read this book for an intro to geology course , and although i find geology to be fascinating , i had a very difficult time following this book the author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious although i understood what mcphee was talking about most of the time , i think it would have made a better film documentary than a book the author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all it would be more readable if written as a field journal because i could not even figure out when one day turned into another but the book did a decent job of presenting the bigger picture
samantha seems a lot like becky a young woman whose life is very out of balance and does n't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions instead of staying at the firm and working out her mistake , she runs away this is just like becky hiding her bills and then she gets a totally implausible job , because she ca n't tell the truth again like becky samantha does n't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to
this is the first book i 've ever returned while a lot of what she does is admirable and does work \( the you form instead of lord he works very well \) , two things make it unusable constant use of beloved for the word god or lord becomes irritating very quickly , and she subjectively pops out the word enemies wherever it appears and puts in fears i would n't dare tell someone with aids or a refuge or whomever that their only enemy is their own fears , and even for others such overpersonalization does n't work the classic 137th psalm was unrecognizable where did the dolphins come from
bad paper , old advice just plain awful and a waste of money
of the thousands of books i 've read in my life , and the hundreds i 've actually purchased from amazon com , this is the first time i 've felt strongly enough about a book to write any sort of review
just not my cup of tea well written but as i said not my cup of tea i will not purchase the others in the series
three things make me better than sean hannity
i bought this book 2 years ago almost to the day i have the receipt stuck in the book i can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then i just ca n't stomach anymore and i put it down for 2 more years maybe this is a piece of art something to be treasured and something that should change your life but pleasure reading should n't be this painful i wish the store would take it back but i think i 've probably had it for too long
the first book of auster 's new york trilogy was originally published in 1985 , and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel i 've never read the original \( or any of the other parts of the trilogy \) , so i ca n't comment on karasik and mazzicchelli 's adaptation however , i can say that since i'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature \( those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for auster 's story \) , this really did n't do anything for me at all the story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , great i do not it is dressed up \( at least initially \) in the mystery genre , but that 's just window dressing \( there 's a long legacy , especially in france , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings \( for example alain robbe grillet 's two books the erasers and the voyeur , or the films of jean pierre melville \)
paul auster 's city of glass is perhaps the worst read i 've experienced the story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated i kid you not the best part of this novel is the end i read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid however , i was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams to all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical , existential tour de force , i beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ i believe the author had no such thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining , dry dry dry piece of fiction with one or two not so clever plot devices , gather such literary praise like a rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of wonderful symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , intepret and dwell in that depth coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life , well , then , good for you but in reality , the person that made that rorschach for you is auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you all bought it hook line and sinker this novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us little on the way and still receive praise , despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work , in that it plain and simply sucks
this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money page 364 principles of long term investing chapter 8 shows that among the sandp 500 index returns , large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks now look at chapter 8 of the 10 largest corporations , only 2 \( exxon mobile and citigroup \) are value stocks duuhhh now i know what to do i have a choice of two stocks if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket , buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart if you know little , it wo n't add to your knowledge at all
i bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects , and given most other people 's ratings , i decided to give it a try however , upon opening the book my first thought was , these all look like high school yearbook photos , which is exacltly what they are it seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market his main concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a saleable picture , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with final say over the pictures a better title for this book would have been , how to take high school senior pictures
ehrman 's work is not for a person of faith it does not take faith into consideration it is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available most forged and falsified and none which can be validated i read it as an immediate follow up to his work lost scriptures books that did not make it into the new testament i was warned by my minister who is also a bible scholar and has two ph d 's and my minister was correct in lost christianities , ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the new testament by implying that many new testament books may be false , forged , translated incorrectly , altered to serve a purpose , etc ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the new testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the new testament ehrman 's lost christianities starts out strong , but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader if for nothing else , it is an attempt to test your faith , but in the end your faith will be strenghtened if you have faith the book leads one to believe that the author is as much a bible critic as he claims to be a scholar he does present all sides of the new testament story and it is interesting how the new testament was formed however , the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does to save you the time and money , simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the new testament and how came to be ehrman and other bible critics \( ie , the devinci code \) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the new testament story save your money and give it to your church instead
i'm a conan doyle fan and found the alienist to be a pretty good read , so i made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it the dialogue is flat , the plot uncompelling and carr relies on the near endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement ! ! ! into this tale , which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because i could n't bear to read the mangled sentences this book has no climax just , thankfully , an ending spend your money on something worth reading
i had read all about fsm before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece
nansook hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to hyojin moon , but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the moon family eyewitnesses tell of nansook visiting the moon household and knowing full well of hyojin 's excesses in advance of her marriage the hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the moon family , and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first moon daughter , they pushed nansook to marry a moon son though i do n't know all the motives , the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that ms hong has not been honest about it is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of rev moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect , given her own deceit
normally , i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started not the case with s i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand the main character violet was too much of a stereotype boobs , red hair , just a boozing slut over all i did n't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her the ending was n't clear either i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades most of the characters just were n't that interesting overall
so , being a fan of all forms of literature , more specifically challenging faulkner , pretentious d h lawrence and original kafka works , i was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what 's considered pynchon 's most imporant work
this smugly edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny
i thought this book was going to be a great legal thriller , but little did i know that it would turn out to be the worst book i have ever read i expected a lot more out of scott turow , who wrote one l , which i loved , but this book was plan boring the begining started out slow and it never picked up from there ! the worst legal thriller , ever
from about the second page of this book , i was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it the characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another add to that the stereotypical characters \( the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys , the women are all large assed or fat with the exception of ella \) and the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb , not to mention kind of repulsive \( i like a good sex scene as much as the next person , but tuck 's descriptions are completely banal \)
i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me nothing ever happens there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story
i agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long genetic algorithms are a great programming tool , and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately , but this book had a lot of redundant information
i agree completely with the becksted review \( i also noted that it was helpful , but i meant it would have been helpful had i read it before i bought the cd \)
yes , it was intended as a fun read \( literature of the absurd \? \) and it did evoke several chuckles , especially at the first but as literature \( read into that word what you will \) it 's an abysmal failure crammed with so many jokes , puns , outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action , one 's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices it 's a case where you ca n't see the forest for all the intervening trees
i 've read most of the books written by greg iles i liked them all except dead sleep , which by the way was much better than this one !
this book tries to convince non christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy , without addressing fundamental objections
this book is poorly written although it is one of the most update to date versions out ther , it seems muddled and repetitive i was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors clearly little time was spent editing this book i'm not sure how it got to be a new york times bestseller , outside of the fact that it is related to harry potter i 'd advise going with a different biography
by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit pollard 's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might and while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion , \( i e swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century \) pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of christian virtue this is basically saying christians have lost a culture war without explaining why
hunt this book down
personally i found this book to be little more than a gre verbal refresher course sure , it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing i think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of , well , then , does this really matter \? in my opinion i feel this is what the author has done i was really disappointed in this book
this book may be as well called the chicken soup for the writing it down souls the author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories however , if you are a self help reader like me who is used to david allen 's getting things done , you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can
the book claims to help you
to anyone who has or is planning on reading this book , consider this this book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone 's guilty conscience ease in thinking that your own will is god 's own will \( quoted from walsh 's books \) if you will it , then god wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom , right \? will is a precursor to action if there is no such this an a 'right' or 'wrong' will , then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right' or 'wrong' action if someone else 's actions hurt you , you feel that action is wrong but the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way , right \? it was his will , therefore he was justified and right and god 's right there to back him up the victim is suffering where is his god when he needs him \? was the victim correct in believing the action wrong \? was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right \? in this book , god says that we have the authority to decide what is right or wrong the action is both right and wrong , right \? wrong
my almost 6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi pronged approach , including things like supplements , a gfcf diet , and ot pt speech after a year on the gfcf diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors , we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies
do n't buy this book , no substance only good for sale
you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume ! does n't this hurt the bottom line at hagee ministries \? what , has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up \? it reminds me of when the band , kiss \( aka kings in satan 's service \) re packaged their first three albums as the originals at least in that case you had an extra track of rock and roll all nite , assuming you already had the album dressed to kill on the other hand , maybe hagee ministries was using the kiss model , assuming that it would n't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy , compact volume of fear
i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath or east of eden instead i have focused on of mice and men and his lesser known works , such as to a god unknown and , my personal favorite , pastures of heaven i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular
this is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity , and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader 's attention the result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying
when i traveled in japan with a friend , this was the book we brought with us within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in tokyo looking for a better one there are some things this guide does quite well it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country , and the advice to get a jr pass was invaluable
this is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s a time when a yarn was n't an archaic term does it give some helpful hints \? sure , there 's the obvious ones like show do n't tell and all characters have free will but fiction has changed a lot since henry james \( thankfully \) , and this book might be better left unread plus , i do n't buy the only people who are n't well read do n't like it argument i 've read nearly all the books mentioned and i still wish i never bought this book
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia is this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note at the end of the book we read sep 10 , 1990 nov 10 , 1993 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted
while easy enough to read , if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover , i would n't know the difference
maybe it was me , but i kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and i had to put it down it was almost aggravating
steer clear of this one criticizing others for lack of original thought or a consistent viewpoint , while virtually copying their cover \( not to mention riding the wave of their unique concept \) illustrates the weak and timid position assumed by this author please achieve your own significance , not bashing others popular and widely accepted readership as christians , we are obviously aware of varying theories on end times to even slightly indicate we are not aware indicates the authors pompous platform so sad his approach could n't be based on his own original work
i was very excited about receiving this book , by the way big upps to lupo997 for getting my book to me in a timely fashion after reviewing the book further i realized it was like touched by an angel , and i do n't like that show at all , but i decided to read it anyway cause it looked good that was a mistake , the character 's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable in the first story rainmaker the professor was sooo in love with hailey he did n't care about getting killed or putting his own child 's life in danger come on now he would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows i did n't even read the second story , maybe i 'll come back to that the third story was totally ridiculous as well paris is so sick of russell he does n't have a job , money and no ambition , yet she stays with him he cheats on her , she has the broads up in her house and sells them mary kay ! ! yet she stays with him he has given her an std ! ! ! she stays with him ! ! ! she does n't even like making love to him during all of this nonsense her fi one boss is pushing up on her , and she resists she wo n't cheat on her man what ! ! ! ! if you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you for everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction do not get this book !
bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny boy were we disappointed as was mentioned in another post the book is nothing more than a glorified outline , and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk , which forms by the way are in pdf form and are not even fillable
i found this book to be full of silly metaphors \( as if that 's the only way we could relate to dr twerski \) it just did n't get me the information i needed perhaps others would find it motivational
this books seems interesting until you learn \( within a few pages \) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct
i agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told there is no excitement in describing the stages they are just wrapped up all of a sudden
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
trash sells and this is the definition of trash unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write
i have read all of the scarpetta novels through the last precinct , and i have never wanted hours of my life back as i did when i finished the last precinct
how some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me first of all , i 'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first ! secondly , if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it ! this book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section horrible ! so basically , this introduction to electronics does n't do a lot of introducing you to anything ! i'm on transistors right now , and i 've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the internet , and guess what \? it 's using schematics i do n't understand , and yet again i'm going to have to do more looking on the net this book is not worth it do n't buy it ! just please , for your own sake , find another one also , half the book is dedicated to projects that is , actually building electronic circuits ! why did n't the author just entitle this , how to build electronic devices , then \? it 's beyond me ! as far as explaining things are concerned , the book does very little , and assume you know more than you do unfortunately i'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook , because this one is just horrible i was really wanting to learn something from this book , but it 's just not happening for every chapter i 've read on this book i 've had to do research on the net , and i'm sick of it i'm on pg 154 , and i'm closing it do not buy this book ! i 've already found a better book on amazon com \( just buy reading the table of contents ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \) and i'm going to get it !
this book is by far the worst proofed book i 've ever read in my life i ca n't believe i'm writing this as a review , because i can normally overlook a few typos however , the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read i ca n't believe i paid money for it
i do n't own this book nor have i read it , but if that first sentence is any indication of the quality of writing , i wo n't ever it is not a sentence one would think you would save your non sentences for someplace else in a book , not start off with one , giving your readers the impression that you are all hat and no cattle before you even make your points
this book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society we can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to while wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate , his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling sorry for them
i am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review however , after reading botox diaries , i felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull , trite , and disjointed i love my chick lit books , but botox diaries is a disgrace to this genre the plot is weak and unrealistic \( even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords lite and fun books \) the plot is also disjointed , perhaps because two authors co wrote this book the characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull botox diaries is absolutely the worst book i have ever read
this is perhaps the most disappointing king book i have ever read \( and considering that i have read desperation and insomnia that is saying a lot \) the storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story i have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top the only thing i found interesting about king as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book
of all the textbooks i 've had , from elementary school through graduate school , this is easily the worst one i 've ever had , for any course
after reading the first book \( which was catastropha \) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series
have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening \? the kind of person that ca n't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered \? well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book you ca n't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or god no you need to relate to it and make it a part of you
to me this book was definately not one of the best in the series i admire the kristina , but this book was slow and dull it was practiacally all about the politics of sweden very dull
i'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with however , my public library has a limited selection of audio books , so i take what i can get i am a voracious reader , and i listen to audios to get more reading in , as you can listen and do other things i much prefer the lillian jackson braun cat books , at least there is some humor , and i like the mystery part of these books better than deaver 's sorry to all the deaver fan 's out there i have enjoyed a few of his books , but i get tired of the same ole same ole
i admit i was impressed by the table of contents of this book , and i admit i had no previous experience with the subject , but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me , this is just enough to be dissapointed there are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free although some formulas and templates looks very interesting \( that 's why 2 stars \) , maybe should you consider a help desk book instead
like most critics of objectivism , mr walker focuses his criticism on ayn rand 's frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded my disappointment in his book was immediate and i have to say it 's as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic i 've read his cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously i cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy this book was written for those of like mind to the author whatever mind they can be said to have
i would normally not read barbara taylor bradford but my boyfriends' mom gave it to me as part of a present , so i said what the heck , i 'll try it
this was n't such a bad novel , and i kind of enjoyed it not great , but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly however , the ending really killed it for me it 's too unnecessarily long once the major conflict is resolved , the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah i wish i 'd just put the book down after the rain because i would 've left with a feeling of at least entertainment but after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications , only pages of explanations , i just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book would 've been three stars if it 'd just known when to end
hi ,
timothy garton ash 's book the file was very provocative and interesting i thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in east berlin before unification and then was able to see his file afterwards however , i am a bit disillusioned the story interests me but garton ash really does n't say anything ! i am disappointed that he so poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state and yet he does not back it up the book is good under the premise of democracy good , communism bad it feels like he is just pooling for support and nobody knew the wall was going to fall when it did i know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism i'm wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event i am dissappointed maybe i just do n't know enough of garton ash but if this is the case , i should not have to feel the need to know his history before reading the book the book had some good points and kept me entertained but on the whole did n't do anything for me peace
petra of all places supernatural protection , persecution , on ad naseum the one drug on , and on , and on , and on
this is a very famous and a very influential book this was not the first time i checked the book out of the library but i now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than i did when i first became familiar with kramer 's book what i found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me this is not a book supported by research it is a book of stories the stories , one after the other , are about kramer 's patients \( kramer is a psychiatrist \) and how taking prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight consider these four examples
i work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books this one caught my eye and i was expecting something wonderful i found the story to be hopeless and defeating how sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat i'm no censor , but two thumbs way down also , if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss , try cynthia rylant 's , cat heaven
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series years later i read s is for silence and was hooked i started to read the series backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine \( and forgiven ms grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 frame \) however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly \( and unbelievable \) dangerous situation , to name a few the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics but even with these issues , i did finish the book grafton at her low point is still a good read
the first few chapters have built the anticipation for a good strategy to learn , however , there were no formulas , nothing to learn
interesting , well documented , with marvelous illustrations definitely a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters it is a pity that the collection does not include stories from one thousand and one nights otherwise it will be perfect and complete
it certainly sounded exciting unfortunately , it 's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you 've already thought of a hundred times that 's not to say that the ideas are n't important i was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks on the bright side , the book wo n't become dated for quite some time
the author had all the elements for a good mystery suspense except for one thing , the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery
flynn offers up a fast paced , if unbelievable story unfortunately , character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters , like rapp , with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles , have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile , flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters , flynn consistently goes for the cheap , partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking
i felt as if this book was way below my reading leve
i'm really a great fan of douglas coupland , which is perhaps much of the reason i found this book so disappointing i hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new microserfs , since it totally lacks the insight , wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original about the only thing it has in common with microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry
then you 'll probably like this story
this book is atrocious it is the worst book i have read in the last decade a 10 year old could have done better the plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses , the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage the only plus was that i got it out of the library and did n't pay for it
why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book \? honestly , what has this author contributed to the world with this book \? was it the characters \? no , they 've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years \( i e cocky and handsome fbi agent , beautiful but dangerous killer with a past , take no sh t fbi boss , etc \) was it the deep insight into the characters themselves \? a laugh out loud , no ! there was nothing coming close to character development was there some new and clever writing style \? unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary \( i call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel \) how about the plot \? was that something worth my time \? not unless you have n't ever watched suspence movie in your life
my friend 's and i will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good my friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along , but since i have a dog , i thought it would be interesting , but it was n't , so i had the honor of throwing it out myself
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point \( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies \) my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter \( and much better writing \) man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
ms reichs has lost the recipe , or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to cross bones although not nearly as bad as p cornwell 's last two or three misfires , reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here in this offering , temperance is out of character , out of both style and focus , and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice reichs has maintained in her many brennan novels having finally given up on cornwell , after many years , i 'll hang in there for one more temperance brennan dig everyone is entitled to one gong
\? millennials rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors william strauss and neil howe , focusing this time on the generation born after x
it certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge based workers are the future in american society it seems to me that drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize marx , which was a complete failure drucker did n't even fully analyze globalization in its entirety
mr o'nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing his skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people , events , etc , is downright frustrating and confuses the project unlike superior literary treatments \( see walter lord 's titanic \) , this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long , hot shower
this fourth installment of becky 's trying tribulations is the worst the qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment i do n't understand how kinsella 's editor did n't draw the line \( and the red pencil \) at the litany of shopping expeditions and her endless , excrutitating 'inner' reflections becky 's exploits are n't amusing anymore her purchases on her honeymoon are n't wacky they 're bewildering for a shopaholic with supposedly good taste , becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on ebay once home in england and oh yes , then she discovers a long lost sister that situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book and then bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by tarquin in his personal helicopter i am not making this up it 's all there in the book and none of it is even remotely entertaining and now god help us , becky is pregnant aarrgggh !
this is a revolutionary book it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology all of social interaction is a performance on a stage it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement the language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated there are some problems with clarity and structure the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me no sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book so if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start \( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction \)
robin williams used to tell a joke about his son , saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and i 'll write a book ' i 'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind peggy salinger 's memior about life with her father , but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea although there are some interesting revelations about salinger as a man , his daughter does n't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of jd salinger , they 're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday there 's a lot of blame thrown around here , and not a whole lot of admitting to one 's own mistakes although this is probably to be expected , it 's still frustrating , since margaret salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father 's good name , and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical \( complaining about your father 's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea \) i admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be , but this is not really a revelation , nor should it affect your feelings about his work i would n't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort
i was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian well , i was wrong it was long , tedious and nasty granted , chaplin was not perfect , but the author 's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening a better title for this book would be 'trash , what i think of charlie' joyce milton would do well writing for tabloids
many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable \( i happened to be 13 when i read it \) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault
i am a bright student and have a gpa of 3 86 this book is completely useless for class i reread the chapters and it simply does not make sense i found the internet to contain more useful information this book should not be used in any introduction to philosophy classes it is much too complex if you are attending classes at wiu , i would skip the purchase of this book and rely on the internet for your assignments
great book , of course , but for this edition oxford used a computer to justify the type on every other line you encounter three or four spaces where there should be only one it may not bother most readers , but i'm looking for another publisher 's edition
this should be retitled the leftist , israel hating , politically correct revisionist guide to the middle east that would be far more accurate for a textbook , the author freelances just a tad bit too much , a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise the author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the middle east and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way
if you 're going to write about the city that is paris , you 'd better be up to the task gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well , but this collection of essays generally falls flat for someone who resided in the city of light for 5 whole years , gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self absorption those who are interested in paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a new yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city i have zero interest in my toddler does paris stories and gopnik 's relentless insertion of his look how cute my kid is accounts should have been saved for a family re union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics
the book is n't good at all i'm sorry i loved i am legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies \( hell house included \) i was really excited to read this i have heard many complaints about the book from calling it soft porn to sick soft porn and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale sacrilege in a book called hell house is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary i doubt these were mathis' sexual fantasies in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying it is an effective way to convey horror to a reader similar to enacting horrible violence on children , or worse , babies in cinema \( try watching the hills have eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face \) mathis should not be condemned for content
no thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story
this book is more of the same rehashed , recycled , repurposed content from the authors much of this material is available in any basic marketing text in fact , this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding if you 've worked at any of the big agencies mccann , jwt , yandr , you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour all the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak the editorial reviews listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as cases in the book
a dirty job was my first christopher moore novel , and will probably be my last i was captivated by the story line as i read the dust jacket , but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting i thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest , and very little addressing the actual theme of the book although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book 's hero , i just was n't drawn in enough to care about him the action began in the final quarter of the book , and you had better suspend reality before reading it i actually could n't wait for the book to end so i could move on to something more interesting
i enjoyed andy kessler 's book about finance \( wall st meat \) but this one is just silly it seems to show the wisdom of the old writer 's saw about sticking with something you know about this book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day i could n't wait to get to the end so i could throw it out
the word atlas is misleading as there is alot of text accompanying the various maps some pages are nothing but text i expect an atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words the maps that are in the book are good , but numerous sections do not have one
wow what lies i never hear any kind of news channel favor the left never the media , especially fox news , has a right wing bias its 100 fact , proven beyond any reasonable doubt the republican right wing nut job wackos invented the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage , and its simply not true
the amazon description says vol 1 3 , boxed set , hardcover that is all true what they do n't tell you is that there are actually six volumes the box in which it comes is clearly marked , volumes 1 3 \( of six \) that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used if you have volumes 4 6 and you are looking to complete the set , this book is for you if you are looking for the complete set , look elsewhere
sadly , this thrilling sea yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today between the seafaring jargon which must have delighted boys of yore and the unfathomable dialects , it can take ages to puzzle out a page some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner we 're here , which has picked up over privileged harvey cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner , i could not grasp the point or moral of my husband has read all the patrick o'brian series , so i asked him to puzzle out a representative story , that of counahan the navigator , and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood , he said , honey , i see what you mean one can get the general gist , but it 's best to read through fast , then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense
i would not personally recommend this book to horror thriller fans i would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18 ! if you like soap operas , you may enjoy this book a lot if you are searching for the secrets of rose red or a good ghost story , this is not your book
the book 's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues this approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a lesbian led household especially a girl child if the child is a boy and or approachng 8 or 9 years old , the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked
if you want a very simple will or a very simple living will or power of attorney for health care , this program will work for you however , it offers only a very narrow range of options for personalizing the generic forms included in the package i disliked this program so much that i threw the whole package in the trash
tipler says many times as i have proved huh \? what the f is he talking about \? there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth he 's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book i 'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense , but i do n't think it should matter i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts , and tipler just does n't make any sense his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time the more books you read , the sooner you know when to stop reading , put the book down , and read a work of fiction instead , which can play with such ideas without boring you to death
i enjoy the hillerman navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed not so in this book i found the first half really boring and hard to get through the characters were not people you could care about , an important issue for me
as a piece of entertainment , this book falls flat way flat there is a story here , but mundane sub plots \( including the love story \) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book i found myself skipping pages lots of them to get to the point overall , very disappointing
amazingly tedious for a thriller reacher is a good character , believable in his expertise , but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence the book takes too long to tell everything \( and i mean everything \) it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought reacher has \( many repeated over and over \) i hope child fixed these flaws in later books
i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book , considering the title however , the actual project does n't make an appearence until the last chapter the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place
as i read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by mr cussler , the story was slow and the plot was transparent
does d s know any other law schools besides , harvard and yale for her characters to have attended i am so tired of her books this is it for me its the usual suspects for her rich and white quite boring i used to love her and would read anything from her , but those days are over maybe she should retire
the very first thing you read in this book is a mistake the prologue begins with a photo of german pows at the end of wwi the photo caption states that the german army at the end of wwi was unbroken and implies that germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership this is doubly misleading the german army was soundly defeated on western front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate in 1918 , germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by ludendorff and hindenberg the political leaders who lost will were the german high command defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious stab in the back myth used by the german military and right wing propagandists to undermine the weimar republic its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters
this book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms as a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure , i am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork i had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it the book gives some accupoints for specific problems , some of these are golden points able to stand alone in use , but others are not the book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence , or not also , it does't tell where the points are exactly there are really too many flaws to go into here acupressure is very complex , this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo
i bought this software hoping that it would help me to find required mathematical formulas faster at home on my powermac \( osx 1 , os9 2 \) i only see messed up windows furthermore , the formulas are unreadable , using an archaic font trying to save the day , i went to my linux machine at work reading your operating system , linux 2 2 19 7 0 1 , is not supported by this software it appears that the software is only suitable for some sun and sgi machines it only appears to run properly on a windows machine from an editor , who i remember , is one of the few persons finding errors in knuth 's tex system , i expected much better
the number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market \? one reason , apparently embraced by the goldstones , is that it is so easy to write a book ! all you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences they do n't have to be particularly interesting experiences you do n't have to do any research into your subject if you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing , if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took , if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers \( even if they are not interesting or witty \) , and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in , you can finish the book in a couple of weekends ! and readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done
what exactly is it that ms wearstler does \? this book is filled with glam pictures of recycled design ideas by billy haines , dorothy draper and billy baldwin , mostly of the hollywood regency style ms wearstler , whose home it is , appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look
fans of the abc tv show lost will probably be buying our mutual friend in droves after having seen desmond keeping it to be the last book i ever read since i did not have to buy it , having purchased a full set of dickens years ago , i immediately set out to read it
the title is a misrepresentation this is not a handbook for driving a porsche quickly or professionally i bought this book because in 2 months i am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a f1 circuit i have no circuit experience , and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country i live in since this is a rear engined car which i have little experience with i was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars there is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving porsches or rear engined cars the only reason i will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960 's and early 19970 's porsche racing pictures \( poor quality black and white though \) also to be fair there are some good racing stories he is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing a better title would be my porsche racing history if you want a book on fast driving i would highly recommend ross bentley 's speed secrets in place of this book
when i picked up this book i had high expectations , seeing that it had received good reviews it opened quite spectacularly as well , on a rather surreal note but as i read on , i could n't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent , rambling tale the book seemed like a sloppy , haphazard collection of incidents that did n't make much sense or assist character development the central character herself was unbelievable and i found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights it seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip , cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky some incidents were quite mirth provoking , however , that 's why i gave it two stars
this was another pinker book i could n't finish if he was a taxi driver he would take you from brooklyn to new york via san francisco sometimes even his asides have asides ! perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
while i very much enjoyed miss wearstler 's first book , i found domicilium decoratus to be borderline obnoxious rather than show great decorating , the book focused mainly on close up shots of objects in her house that took up the whole page in addition , i feel that as the viewer of the book i do not need to see fifteen entire pages of miss wearstler dressed in ball gowns pretending to be domestic
i am an avid reader , and i will finish a book no matter how difficult it is , or how boring it is , and i could n't finish this one it was so dry and i could n't connect with any of the characters i was really disappointed
i want to make a short comment here
the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case , when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is \? we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen , the characters are outrageous , most of the time improbable , and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid , not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it
this book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content , and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible what a bunch of baloney
an elf appearing to harry potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery the chamber of secrets , he said , had been opened and a monster is lurking harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster , challenge it and save students who have been petrified by the monster age group interest early teen i wanted to see what all the rave was about lots of action , not much morale
a writer for the irish echo said this book should have been titled the protocols of the elders of erin it was written around the time al smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist , anti catholic prejudices of upstate new york and america at that time while there really were gangs in that era , most of new york 's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like st vincent 's , fordham , st john 's , manhattan and manhattanville the vast majority of the city 's population including its immigrants did n't riot in 1863 in fact new york city 's 200 , 000 soldiers and sailors , more than half of whom were immigrants , won over 100 medals of honor during america 's civil war
i find it very difficult to get through half of this book i have put it down and picked it up more times than i care to mention it is a waste of time awful book

this is a very bad book it is poorly written , the characters are caricatures in misery , and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter , who suffers in silence after the devastating , and , to her , mysterious , death of her mother her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child 's behavior , which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response , rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break i could n't finish this it is drivel
i was looking forward to reading this book , first in a series sadly , i gave up on it about 100 pages in i felt there was so much mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all it just feels completely unemotional and without any sort of feeling there is nothing exciting about this book the heroine is naive , and not in a good way i hope the others in this series are better 1 5 stars
this book provides a good overview of blacks \( slave and free \) in new york it 's a very good reference \( encyclopedic \) book
i have received your new book against the human race , and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs , in reading your book , to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years , i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada , because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves voltaire \( 1755
in a world desperate for health solutions , the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters
i found stale recounting of very well known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics , with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors , and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface , i was n't expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg \( about technology in the economy of the 19th century \) i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the 1980s i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy
this book is simply horrible repetitive dialogue and situations characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes
ok , i ca n't deny it , this book was well written but what made me throw up is the age differance , i mean what the hell ! how can tana like someone who 's 30 years older than her \? that 's aweful ! this is what i really hate about dan 's books , she hooks someone who 's 20 with some1 who 's 35 i do n't find that interesting all i can say about full circle is that it 's good but so depressing it made me cry \( which proves that danielle is a good writer \) do n't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed
i have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration and i love books , so this is drastic ! spoilers ahead please do n't read on if you have n't read the book i managed to \( somehow \) get through the first book , 'wideacre' , which i disliked whilst i adore the rest of gregory 's novels , so this was hard for me and grit my teeth and tried to read this book , the sequel as i 'd bought it and it looked more promising it was 'marginally better' as one reader put it , than the first , but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed
chromosome 6 has a great premise what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs a sort of biological insurance policy \? how much would people pay for this service \? how far would they go to protect it \? what are the moral implications \?
well , if anything this was a decently written story , with good dialect and character detail however , this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there
after get shorty , e l might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again , with this single minded purpose focused , e l wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty and he was right again , it was bought and made into a movie again , but pathetically , a horrible one compared to get shorty the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e l indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind i simply failed to find there 's any interest in reading this going nowhere story it just like reading a double imaged e l personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie , with all the bore to death script , dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles , especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty' \? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose' \? and at every corner of los angeles , every table in any restaurant , almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer' \? and you have to ask yourself since when people would recognize a behind the screen movie producer , even a director in person \? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are \? yeah , maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly \? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show \? give me a break ! this book , from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no brainer , so shallow and so superficious ! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash in
gail 's writing is again wonderful in this in book , but i found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure i felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character 's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be i almost felt as if the writer was n't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic , yet hopeful story i can only compare this book to the samurai 's garden since i have n't read a third book by this author yet , and i loved the samari 's garden ! so i was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end i am not sorry that i read this book due to the fact that i enjoy the author 's style of writing
i wanted to like this book , but i found it disappointingly thin i would n't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as hopeless , but it 's certainly superficial postman seems to rely on secondary sources about enlightenment thought , rather than any deep reading of enlightenment texts the idea of building a bridge to the 18th century seems more like a marketing device , a fresh way of presenting some of postman 's familiar themes , than a serious proposition \( he even includes a summary of his disappearance of childhood argument in an appendix \) it 's a shame , really , because the enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long , and postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what 's good and admirable about contemporary society to enlightened thinking for a much more substantial survey and defence of enlightenment thought and culture , read roy porter 's the creation of the modern world the british enlightenment
i would not neccessarily call this book christian it is more of an historical account , bible as literature type of book it does make you think about different aspects of jesus life , but most of that is speculation or perception yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end
this book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually no understanding of computer systems by the author i do n't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving , but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes , firewalls and hacking techniques , those details must be fairly correct in this case , the technical details were so wildly implausible that i finally had to stop reading the part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access nsa data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details the nsa almost certainly does n't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet \( through any combination of firewalls \) but if they did , they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked
this is one of the worst books ever , do n't buy it
i am a huge clyde edgerton fan , and i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed with this book it just never seemed to get off the ground i was expecting the type of story that i fell in love with in raney and walking across egypt \( both of which left me in tears , i laughed so hard \) if you 're looking for listre , you 're not going to find it in this book oh well , i guess i 'll wait on his next one
i had to read this book for a diversity class sennett uses language and sentence construction that is overly ostentatious and difficult to understand inside this fat book is a very thin book trying to get out he needed a good editor
the material is first rate but his writing style is horrid his five part typology of memory does n't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter the underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material there are much better and clearer books on the holocaust ! do n't bother with this one
i have sent away for a book called lord given lovers the holy union of david and jonathan as i find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages , now that david has been used in this subject as married to jonathan , in the days when the scibes who wrote the law against such things , i would like to know why david and jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law , and if david did such a thing , i would believe that all the jews then would have did so to , copying david and jonathan`s example
i was anxious to read the reviews on this book and i am happy to find its not just me ! her words and sentences are redundant ! yes wacky artist was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages ! liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter ! we know ! do n't tell us 100 times ! this is what i think either ms steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material or she 's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing is d steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work \? also , is it cold stone sober \? or stone cold sober \? \( it should have been the latter \) no editor caught that mistake \? i 've been a fan of ms steel 's work for 21 years now and the past few year 's works have been deplorable ! i first excused it due to the death of her son but her talent never picked up again from the ranch onward the books are just pure fluff if you want to read a novel and not think about what you 're reading then read her books , this one especially if you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try barbara delinsky , luanne rice , alison clement , susan wiggs
it has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher antony flew , the world 's number one atheist \( at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments \) has recanted his atheism
having read \( and thoroughly enjoyed \) levitt 's freakonomics , i picked up hidden order the economics of everyday life looking for more of the same unfortunately , i was sadly disappointed
if you are going to walt disney world resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions , then this book may not be for you some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step by step through them , including plot points in 3d movies and so on the book also leaves a lot out in other areas , such as dining \( little coverage \) , getting around walt disney world , and off site hotels and dining
mr friedman 's book begins with an interesting thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth the idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that friedman often well supports with historical facts however , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that , with a little thorough thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven with these things being the case , i find friedman 's argument a little hard to buy the entire book seems to build up to the final chapter , which friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book \( ie the importance of education \) do not add or support his final policy recommendations his policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question what should the government do to promote economic growth \? they do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies
for decades , african american studies scholars have left issues facing non heterosexuals to the side for years , queer scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side this anthology tries to address that void it goes a long way in proving that black , gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones the anthology has representative numbers of men and women in some ways , it 's a who 's who of black gay academia , including works from cathy cohen , dwight mcbride , and jewelle gomez
in a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book , popop from boston \( april 9 below \) alludes to some children blown up by an ira bomb in a north of england shopping center popop is very broad minded it pains him that anyone would bad mouth such armed operations they were perfectly justified , he explains , because of thousands of innocent irish catholics murdered at the hands of the british army
investment biker 1 1 2 stars , just barely escapes the lowest possible rating
the case for marriage makes arguments supportive of pres bush 's policies on marriage however , howard kurtz of the washington post \( 1 26 5 \) reports that maggie gallagher was paid over 40 , 000 by the bush administration to write columns and a private report supporting its 300 million hhs marriage initiative
i was lured into reading under the volcano after seeing its inclusion on the modern library 's one hundred best of the 20th century and after reading a reviewer compare it to james joyce \( i am an amateur joycean who tries to read ulysess , portrait of the artist , and dubliners at least annually \) lowry has nothing that likens him to joyce this book is leaden and tedious i forced myself to finish it because i hate to start a book and not finish it but it was no labor of love it was simply a labor
this is not one of lonely planet 's best guides there is suprisingly little information for example , the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services basically , everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in rekyavik , which luckily is run very well i found this really disappointing since iceland is very expensive and i was hoping to keep down costs \( in reality this is almost impossible , even eating at the grocery store i was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese \) furthermore , iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details
i think the linda howard who wrote white lies , sarah 's child , duncan 's bride , mackenzies mountain , diamond bay , etc is one of the most talented current romance writers
that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me luckily , i bought this book used , otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price between her utterly uninspired devotional dances to things such as sex , wisdom , and the sticky one \( a term she made up for the astral body \) , and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to anoint it , i was unimpressed , to say the least however , driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book it 's very , very amusing if you do n't take it seriously the thing that makes me sad is that she 's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth there 's nothing evolutionary about it , unless you consider being a wanton , idiotic freak evolutionary if this is what humanity is evolving into , i am frightend
this book dragged on and on the ending was stupid and the plot was pathetic very similiar to the devil wears prada which was also bad do n't waste your time on this one
unlike cussler 's other series , i found this first story of the oregon files slow going at first and rather confusing there are just too many things going on \( no problem , i suppose , for multi taskers ! \) and way too many characters to keep track of also , there 's little to no character development even of mr chairman , juan cabrillo the fact that he and his companions are mercenaries \( with a penchant for good deeds that pay well \) does n't compare favorably with the numa heroes however , the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides i expect from mr cussler and co writers i look forward to the subsequent oregon files with high hopes
sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian this book is awful the storyline is weak and predictable , the dialogue is excruciatingly lame , and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry there is virtually no romance , which is the reason to read sparks' books i ca n't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said , the way the dog seems to be human , and the predictability of the plot this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it if you want a good plot with romance mixed in , read message in a bottle or a walk to remember if you want suspense , read mary higgins clark or agatha christie they do a far better job with it than sparks does
i read this book and i think presented material is not practical in commercial applications in my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications i know this is something different from contracts , by i think contracts are to complex , hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems
some may disagree , and in fact , many have asked me why i disliked this one so much so , here is why
and the maps are worthless
this book is not very helpful and confusing to use a lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels if you buy those brands
gives many examples of weapons , most of which are useful
i found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what i was looking for the small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
it 's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content this book was so frustrating , i really wish i had saved myself the bother of reading it
the photos are beautiful , the designs are just wonderful but if you have kids this is not real life this is a magazine lifestyle you could only do this if you had an unlimited budget , there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets sure my home could be organized if i had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built ins , and all the baskets i could buy ! stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table
this book is mostly hype the writing is not that great japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world 's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work however the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way if you are a serious reader skip this book
this is a kids book first few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book
i keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are , but i have never found this to be so he always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it he seems more at home studying statistics \( which he includes everywhere \) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics i always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper , surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world all his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone just comments on them later still lots of people think he is grea
sorry guys , i looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media the graphics of the book are truly beautiful the recipes however , hmmm , try again i followed a simple recipe for apple crisp and got a bad result i now go to respected standard cookbooks for my apple crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great really people , the recipes are not the stuff of greatness graphics \? great photography \? great \? recipes \? you have got to be kidding
imagine , just as i was getting bored with this book , through an odd act of contingence its binding literally fell apart in my hands a loki eshu hermetic encounter \? what a thankful rescue rambling and indulgent , such repetition would be better kept to a long essay rather than a full book a trickster 's story , indeed
so you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about hemingway 's ghost and you 're ready to drop some cash , right \? guess what there 's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book ! in addition , old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic 's version of handel 's halleluja chorus instead , what 's offered here is a rehash of old stories \( and old theories about what ghosts could be \) with insipid , comic book illustrations why this is called a field guide with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon be it birds , plants , or mushrooms is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists if you 're a serious researcher of this subject , then pass this book up and seek hem 's fetch elsewhere
creepiest book ever
leaving the racism issue aside , this is not a book for small children even if everything turns out ok in the end , i'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between perhaps i'm a softie , but let 's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading just because it 's a classic does n't make it appropriate reading
racism is not the problem with this book sure 5 chinese brothers look alike maybe they look alike because they are brothers , not because they are chinese i bought this book because generally i love the books written in earlier times they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time this book does have engaging illustrations what i find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet
unfotrunately shantaram did not grab my imagination at all nor did i find it emotionally satisfying i realize shataram is meant to be a kind of bollywood story over the top , flowery , cliched etc but the bollywood movies i 've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying , despite their soppyness etc shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story
first i have to admit , i only read 150 pages of this book that was all i could possibly stand life is just too short to waste on a book you do n't enjoy reading
by arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of dignity and familiarity rather than sentience and feeling , fukuyama brings to mind the european colonists who considered africans no more than common beasts his philosophy , although argued in a tone that seems reasonable , is at turns startingly narrow minded and genetically racist not reccomended readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics
do n't waste your money on this book i will finish the book because it is our book club choice the characters are shallow and self centered the writing is middle school quality kris radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water no poetry and no beauty , i could care less about the women in this book who could possibly think life 's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine \? i treasure my sisters and women friends but i would n't want to be a friend to any of these women i would give it no stars if i could
the book is amazing ! the cd is horrible ! stick to reading the book yourself i have over 45 audio books and this was like listen to a bad commercial i had to turn it off there is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading they do n't even state who the narrator is !

sorry guys , i looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media the graphics of the book are truly beautiful the recipes however , hmmm , try again i followed a simple recipe for apple crisp and got a bad result i now go to respected standard cookbooks for my apple crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great really people , the recipes are not the stuff of greatness graphics \? great photography \? great \? recipes \? you have got to be kidding
all i could think was , damn , if i had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge , i 'd never be depressed i do n't know quite how to explain it , but i felt no empathy for him i only ended up feeling more depressed as a history of depression , the level of research was quite impressive
roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better based on the theories of david ricardo , the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible in the choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt ceos fables like the choice \( or the free market economy for that matter \) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple that 's why the book is dangerous the choice has almost nothing to do with the real world , but it sounds good the argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable if you buy roberts' version of ricardo , however , you must accept wal mart as the epitome of business virtue
this book turned out to be a disappointing resource although the book includes 20 , 001 names , many are unlikely and outlandish \( klotild , edwige , ghislain , ethelbert , birtle \) , making it arduous to sift through to find the names more worthy of consideration
an american tragedy by theodore dreiser is considered one of the greatest american books ever written this may be the case if you can get past the first chapter five times , i have tried to read this book to date , i am 0 for 5 , having fallen asleep each time trying to read it if you 're a bit of a lazy reader or one who does n't want to work through a book , this is not for you try mark twain instead

i 've read all of nevada barr 's anna pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until i reached hard truth after writing so many intellligent , suspenseful stories , barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime murder 's not nasty enough \? how about the murder of children \? still not gruesome enough \? add incest rape torture you get the picture
some times it is nice to have a book that points out the obvious you can be too close to a problem to notice the obvious unfortunately this book is too obvious and it is all fluff with no substance wait you say this is a design book what do you want \? code \? i really wanted design so where is it \? between the pages that tell how to use exotic tools to do what html can \? or is it between the lines that keep emphasizing speed \? or is it that this is one big advertisement for the contributors \? oh well , it makes you look scholarly to have this book on the koffee table
i own and have read all of ja jance 's jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character 's lives i picked this book up , thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i 've read previously what a crashing disappointment i ca n't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations truth be told , i kept looking at the cover to see if i 'd picked up a harlequin by mistake i 'll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series , but i 'd much rather see what happens with jp and joanna incidentally , i did n't think much of either of them , either , when their paths crossed some books ago this one gets a big aw , c'mon , ja , you can do much better than this ! from me for those who have n't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj , get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning they are worth the time and effort
considering that this is virtually the first attempt \( as far as i know \) at a dictionary of the pentecostal charismatic movement , this is a good start it is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws the title international leads one to expect much more coverage of pentecost outside of the u s canada , where pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the u s , is given very scanty treatment some major early canadian apostles , such as o j lovik , are skipped entirely there is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize a balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer , rather than by the leaders of those movements finally , there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires , above all else , keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff that said , i will consult my copy often , for the great amount of useful material it does contain
this book is filthy i had to take a shower after i read it why does n't he get a job \? why does he have to live in france \? why does n't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers \? so many questions people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned it was banned because it 's a bad book
mr winchester takes an interesting subject , collects enough material to make a fine article in , say , national geographic , and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length \( case in point , a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid , but loses it , and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss ick self induldgent boring \) worse , still , even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material , such as relates , say , to the subject 's wife , all mr winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations i guess extensive research might have been too time consuming numerous times i considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful , but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going , hence my review of two stars
while i applaud ms lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of janie hendrix 's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit , there are some very serious credibility problems here
bought this one for evolution class it is a horrible excuse for a textbook do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student if the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience , then i would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend university of washington
while i did find the book informative and a good supplement to robert sobel 's the great bull market wall street in the 1920s , galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s bull market way too much this makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read while i persevered to the end , i fouynd sobel 's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read
i was very disapointed by this book after just finishing the 400 pages book bull ! from maggie mahar which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles \( although the more recent boom of 1982 1999 \) , the great crash was really hard to read it totally shows its age \( it was written more than 50 years ago \) the language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time
i have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title as others have pointed out , coughlin 's ego can be suffocating at times this could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw alas it is not the writing is amateurish at best and the author 's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting the language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an english grad student
the beginning of this book was excellent , but dont be fooled , the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers what 's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were this was one of the worst books i have ever read , i 'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery dont waste your time reading it
several reviews of this book , published elsewhere , stress
i give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that nicholas wade has presented and in the manner it was presented , dna and the secret family of thomas jefferson
if you admired the young mccourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in angela 's ashes \( a 'sa \) , this book is sure a huge deception the first 80 pages are a great continuation to a'sa , but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops , as if mccourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas the storyline becomes chaotic , changing the day today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again , no order or sense whatsoever
like the other posters , i too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from china after reading the first chapter i found myself insulted this book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant , which is not my case while infertility is something that should not be ignored , and i appreciate the fact that most adoption books i read address the matter , this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive i was so insulted that i returned the book to my social worker with these concerns
i have long had the desire to read a grisham book , because i have heard good things well , my chance came and i was sorely disappointed the audio cd 's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber the opening to the book kept me going , but by chapter three , i had already decided this , if sam cayhall lives i'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes , and if he dies , he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the hero to the story sadly , i pursued curious about the ending i'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book , because it only took six hours to get through it sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author mayber grisham 's other books are better , but i wo n't be reading them
we live in a man 's world women are raped , abused , beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification this is an epidemic problem , and christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population
the principle question that arises from a reading of soul by soul by walter johnson is why was this book written \? it is touted as history , yet not only does it lack any original historical material , it also lacks any discernable historical facts rather than history , soul by soul seems to be a mean spirited , emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas 1 that white people living in the antebellum south were universally loathsome , brutish and cruel and 2 that black people living in the antebellum south were universally noble , good and abused to support his views , professor johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings his personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book 's long deceased characters and divine their true , but unspoken , motives and thoughts quite a feat for any historian ! one loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their probing fingers in this book fortunately , in between probes , the reader can be shocked by the killing fields of the lower south , the historical sexualization of black bodies , the slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves , and the brutish perogatives of whiteness this is heavy , hate filled stuff worthy of a tv mini series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text i live in a former slave quarter in new orleans in the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the emancipation proclamation as an amateur historian , i would have thought that a book about the new orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets what were their addresses \? what percentage of their customers were black \? what percentage were white \? how many slaves did the typical new orleans household have \? how were they fed and clothed \? what were their working hours \? these are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , repetitious , boring rehash of tired , previously published material in short , this book , for the most part , reads like a rambling , overly long sermon anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the slave narratives compiled by the federal writers project , time on the cross by robert fogel and stanley engerman and the slave trade by hugh thomas the first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the w p a in the 1930 's the latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery , not the emotions
sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of cosulting business but then , for the price of this book , i would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas such as consulting for dummies the book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant but come on , consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural , systematic yet creative thinking overall , i think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant while for beginner , the reader will risk the wrong impression that it 's this easy to win a consulting work highly unlikely in a complex and competative world
another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation if you dig that sort of thing there are tons out on the market unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers like one would get when reading a book on the occult people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it it is a living when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism or in this case the secret agenda before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad
a biography about a boy and a very tough and brave one who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors \( or killed and maimed \) of iwo experienced he saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice by strict definition , this act was deserving of the medal of honor his terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching , but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of iwo veterans , or any other battle , i have read the other accounts i have read generally conclude war is a horrible thing to experience , and not glorious , but i would do it again
this book states that it 's better to die than survive a rape
this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept , but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist , the prose is stiff , and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading , but i really did n't get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation which takes place after the press conference , where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it 's a title to read if you wish to be considered well read despite its faults , valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten , just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird
sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that three junes was listed as a popular book choice the title sounded interesting so i bought it that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition it is difficult to follow the timeline , to understand the characters and where they fit , and to get involved in the storyline i will finish the book because that 's my style it has not been a book that i could not wait to get back to
sadly this second book left me unsatisfied for one , wouk 's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second of course , once one has read through the first book , its hard to stop yet , by the end of war and remembrance i was thoroughly sick and annoyed by wouk 's characters it 's hard to relate to super humans , who constantly do super human feats most of the characters in the book come from superior stock , graduate from the top universities , have extremely good looks , and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane
the book was fun but the fact that it is too long overshadowed all this fun i got the impression it was rather written to become a movie all i can say is that thanks to c bushnell for 'sex and the city'
i'm sorry to say , this work will not rate very highly on my scale
miniter takes advantage of the american ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole maybe he could get together for a book with ann coulter
like everyone of you , i am crazy about my toddler i got this book and the book of wendy s masi' toddlers play the comarison day and night kuffners book might have 365 activities , but it really bad organized i am a first time parent , so i need some help guidance thsi is why i baught this bbok
without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and steve allen 's pivitol role it sadly ben alba 's inventing late night steve allen and the original tonight show'' , is not that book it is , largely , a poorly edited and self contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with allen 's tv contemporaries these interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers scott berg \( sam goldwin \) or neal gabler \( walter winchle \)
it truly is the best war fiction regarding wwii if you have never read any other fiction regarding wwii i love war fiction and non fiction and beside parroting the time magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel i can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion to me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating what it is , is a bloated , narcisstic , misogynistic waste of time
i enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things i would n't eat in the first place
communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history , responsible for the extermination of 100 million people this book \( which started it all \) holds at least much of the blame communists were and still are a threat to the free world , and communism is a slave system some intellectuals actually support the tired mantras of marx 's philosophy , whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who have n't seen enough sunlight , i do n't know in any case , if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property , and is totalitarian and slave driving \( the government owns everything , including you \) and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up pol pot , mao , stalin \( of course \) , etc etc who are these people kidding
not sure this is the book to study for the pmp agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it also , the intergration knowledge area is missing i think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better
this book irritated me on many levels not that the writing was poor or the plot weak in fact , the plot , the premise , the writing were good unfortunately the characters did n't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable
this book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough french to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory i found french in 10 minutes a day much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook
i ca n't remember the last time i failed to finish reading a novel i abandoned this one with 100 pages to go with another implausible plot twist , i 've had enough
i have been a huge fan of dean koontz for years , ever since my mom got me to read watchers but this story is just way too slow just when i thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride it would slow way down again i almost put it down halfway through the book , but i kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner about 2 3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining but i just felt like something was missing most of the time i was reading i just could n't get into the characters i would n't recommend this book to any first time dean koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off do n't judge his work by this novel
if you are interested in learning about the actual science of food , but do n't want to learn any science , at least read a book by someone who did learn it there is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely oil is more dense than water and that 's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212 as a chemist and formulator i can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water , and even if it were n't that 's not the reason it has a higher boiling point ever make oil and vinegar salad dressing \? ever seen crude oil on the ocean \? how about the funk on top of old greasy dish water \? folks , oil floats on water and the earth is not flat either this guy is a complete moron , or he is a very clever con artist either way , save your money and buy that blind amish author 's book semiconductor microengineering for dummies instead it 's better researched
i was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of paris , a city i have visited often the book fell far short of that it left me disappointed and longing for what i had missed it was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject as an example , she tells us that moving within paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth where were her feelings , little experiences , failings , successes , reactions overall , the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it
24 95 is way too expensive for a book that is only 100 pages other than that the content in the book is good
normally i do n't take the time to write a review , but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good , but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of 30 books that i paid 15 for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it
the companion web site mentioned in the book is not there when i typed in that url , i got redirected to peachpit 's advertising site of this book , but no links , tools , nor examples mentioned in the book at all !
between the glamour shots and easy sex , different babys' daddys what else is there \? oh yeah , the many scripture quotes and abortion info dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school poor amber !
i absolutely love janet evanovich and the stephanie plum series , so when i saw this new series of books with her name on it , i grabbed them up i could n't even finish reading this book it was so bad the whole talking car concept was , frankly , just stupid this was like watching an episode of knight rider , but without david hasselhoff the characters are flat , and the dialogue is stilted and contrived i can only believe that charlotte hughes did most of the writing , and why on earth would evanovich attach her name to this \? needless to say , i will not be reading the rest of the series spend your money on something worth reading
do n't sell it to one country on microfilm for a lot of money , sell it to everybody in hard cover for 20 00 a pop somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what risen has done here , and what the walkers were imprisoned for
i ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it it was terrible ! tanya holland is a beautiful black woman , but i feel has gone too far out of the way to create innovative and different recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food the price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook i collect african american soul food cookbooks among others if you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent , your money would be better spent on essence brings you great cooking by jonell nash , the ebony cookbook by freida deknight or the black family reunion cookbook by the the national council of negro women if you are interested in healthier soul food try , the new ebony cookbook by charlotte lyons or the family dinner quilt cookbook by the national council of negro women if you are interested in diverse , cultural flavors , i would recommend vertamae grosvenor 's cookbooks or iron pots and wooden spoons by jessica b harris i have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks they cover the gamut that is why i can give an honest opinion on tanya holland 's book i just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average african american can relate to one that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking
i 've always been a big believer in attack the message \( if you do n't agree \) , do n't attack the messenger the reverse has been almost standard practice of the left when they ca n't refute the truth , facts and common sense of conservatives which is close to 100 of the time
i recently read this as part of a survey of childrens' literature about the medieval period let me say first , that the dialogue is completely modernized , with not even a complex word to redeem it i know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect , but please , our children are more sophisticated than that adam is self involved , careless , and annoyingly stupid despite it 's touted 320 pages , this could have been printed in 150 , and contained much the same material the only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of latin and old english ballads scattered throughout if you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times , with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability , have them read song of the gargoyle it 's also about a boy who loses his father , and has to search for him , in the company of a dog like being , but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash the boy is also a minstrel , of sorts , but he has more likable qualities than adam , as well as more adventures in less pages the ending is a happy one , but it involves a twist , which is n't at all forseeable , as theat in adam of the road please , just skip this , i do n't care if it won a newberry award , and read song of the gargoyle , by zylpha keatly snider
early on the author tells how he proved to concept of learned helplessness through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered
my all time favorite book is deavers the blue nowhere and the testament by another author i think this book is on the bottom of my list it was a combo term paper and novel i wonder where the editor of this book is where was he she \? it read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them
well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some unusual experiences \( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening \) , but the question is , is it all as it seems \? the fact of the matter is , various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys \( this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events \) there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario advanced , drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now \( verichip \) i'm not saying that other lifeforms do n't exist in the universe \( far from it \) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are little , menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us historically , there 's been the barbarians , huns , mongols , pagans , jews , christians , vikings , black natives , cannabals , red natives , mexicans , germans , nazis , communists , now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80 's the fact is that with known technology \( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked \) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced \( albeit underground \) than most people can fathom what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised , of which strieber has been front and centre at various times my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign , sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups in this book , his hard evidence is flimsey and suspicious for example , why would n't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue \( thus not showing up on any x ray , mri , ct , etc \) \? and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body \? surely , this would be child 's play for alien scientists \? why no major discussion or mention of the human military , or nazi connection with abductions \? there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange fragments of memories that are slipping through various memory covers why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys \? why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms \? why are some speaking english , others german \? why is there a connection with deep , underground bases and specifically antartica \? these are things strieber never mentions , which i find curious my point is , things are happening , but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what , and strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas
john r barry \( another digital communications textbook author \) first introduced me to this text and mr barry , as with many com theory persons i 've met since \( gtri in atlanta , ga mitre along around the boston area of ma northrup in el segundo , ca intersil in palm bay melbourne , fl \) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs essentially , it 's their bible the only problem is that the values and beliefs in proakis , especially from an engineering perspective , are very third rate trying to use this text in a classroom situation , especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor , is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective
i used to follow politics but now i know better clinton is a hero to poor folk in the us only bc bush is such a nazi , sorry , but clinton did more than any pres in us history to cut welfare to the moms who need it the most ! i ai n't no fool partisan of a richmans party and i do n't like america and yes i'm born and raised in the us , there is no democracy here , only a moneycracy ! ! ! power to the ppl lets make a real country for the ppl , not the capitalist leech scum ! !
i am supposed to get 16th edition , instead i received 15th edition the book was completely changed from the previuos editio
i came to blowback by way of a year long research project on globalization over the past year i have read dozens of books , both scholary and popular , on this topic right left love america hate america multi cultural eurocentric i 've suffered through them all \( happily , there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject \)
this book is inexplicably influential , probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis , instead delivering an exasperating 300 page long list of every single thing on earth that he disagrees with barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world , while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass culture sameness interestingly , barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance , using each other 's excesses as excuses for their anti democratic behavior that is a fascinating thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating
in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , cultural , religious , nationalistic , etc , depending on where you look on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in groups and out groups on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace
this is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing , and cite each other or similar data and research the authors do write well , so i gave it two stars but it has under overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system dump more money into schools teachers are underpaid and overworked high stakes standardized testing is bad folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of jay p greene 's educational myths to run a little de tox on the stuff they read here
this was a comprehensive collection of statistics and war department strategy notes but it had no life it gave no feel for the soldier , sailor or marine on the ground it was all acronyms and big picture strategy if you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war , the participants should get more ink here , the brass get all the attention
i found the book informative while reading it , but also a bit confusing and a little dry , best used for a college course and not for recreational reading \( which is no doubt why we even had it in our house , someone had to use it and it 's equally boring companion for some college course , i'm certain of it
sure , i had fun reading this book but the amazon reviewer who termed it highly speculative is understating the case opinion , conjecture , hearsay , and speculation too often take the place of thorough , solid documentation and unlike many other amazon reviewers , i found mclellan 's tone off putting she alternates between patronizing her subjects \( the very notion of calling them my girls , for instance \) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant \? you bet but is the topic of lesbianism in hollywood well served here \? i do n't think so
judging by the long reviews before me , it should be obvious that there is much to say about calvin 's theology this book does n't say too much for those familiar with his theology , don't buy this book it will be a waste of your money for those who would like to know more about calvin 's theology , without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology , buy this if you want a good in depth coverage of calvin 's theology , buy the full version and enjoy
if you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here
in the possibility that steve berry could ever transcend his not so great debut , the amber room romanov prophecy started in the right direction , third secret was ok , but i think he hit his peak right there
jesus , talk about the little girl crying wolf when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew knows how to deal with what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption
the author is certainly writing for a target audience as one other reviewer said , white , upper middle class , female would be mystics i found the stories of life on the commune mind numbing \( then again , i was born in berkeley in 1970 , so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when i was a kid \) and the rest of what i did manage to read alienating zzzzzzzzzzzz i am not saying this is a bad book at all , just that it 's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest the language was so fuzzy and woo woo that it just irritated my gen x \( for lack of a better word \) postpunk sensibility it 's a shame , too , as i was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality c'est la vie
the book is basically a dictionary of terms in the computer graphic field all most the whole book contain very simple ideas and concept i knew already
this is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced regardless of where you stand politically , johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree throughout this work johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities
this was a terrible disappointment more of a memoir than anything about book collecting , it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was there seemed to be no context or fabric to the book
sheppard 's attempt to capture the american youth angst failed miserably instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through i never developed any connection or understanding of the characters each chapter seemed to stumble into the next , with the end as predictable as the next expletive sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge you 'd do better saving your money , driving to the nearest mall , and find the kid in the anarchy t shirt looking sullen , because it appears that is all sheppard did in this work phew stinker rooney !
this book is seriously out of date for modern web design and development
i read this in jan of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes here goes trashy , but i could n't not finish it story of best friends who go to a summer house every august with their families secret betrayals of friendship , a hidden illness , a birth and a miscarriage what else do you need to make a soap opera style plot \? i give thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage , from envy to despair bottom line rich people with too much money and rich people problems it did n't stay in my short term memory very long
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution
as a long time fan of nicholas sparks , i was a little disappointed in this book the potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more the entire book takes place in this little bed and breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters there just was n't enough going on in this book to keep my attention
it is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject the reviewers who have lamented the short , choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another , without benefit of full explanation or connection , are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book i had to read some paragraphs several times and even then did n't understand what i was reading it was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind , as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on the description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages , which incited one yawn after another the book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances for example , the narrative is littered with sentences like she made for the east exit okay , fine , but did she run , walk , crawl , hop , skip , jump , or fly to the east exit \? i just do n't know what to picture there the word made says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen this type of problem occurs on every page of the book i have n't read anything else the author has written , so i hate to be so critical i wonder , however , why his editor did n't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions i felt as if i was reading a very hastily prepared early draft i have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations this just is n't one of them compare the circus fire to into thin air , heart of the sea , batavia 's graveyard , or ordeal by hunger and you 'll understand what i mean
since i listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as tony roberts performance was so bad , it was impossible to follow the story line he read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did in addition to the slooooow reading , his characterization were completely over the top dino sounded like a moron and billy bob well like a texas moron and what about billy bob , that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story
a much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story the end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
toward the end of how now shall we live , chuck colson states , regarding popular music and media , that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet however , he warns , a diet of junk food can be fatal
i borrowed this from my sister in law to read it is the first barr book i have read i did not like it because of several reasons first of all , the vulgar language was too much one can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter second , it was so mundane for a mystery the writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in yellowstone national park
just enough is more than enough a turgid , pretentious , strident , and wholly unoriginal piece of work its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior , nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self help pop business literature at best , this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the harvard business review , but surely not enough material for 280 pages ! better to read do what you love , the money will follow discovering your right livelihood , by marsha sinetar , and call it a day
well , i thought that the book was coming when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder they did let me get a refund which was nice i would use them again for that reason alone
all i could think was , damn , if i had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge , i 'd never be depressed i do n't know quite how to explain it , but i felt no empathy for him i only ended up feeling more depressed as a history of depression , the level of research was quite impressive
please take this to heart
it is difficult , nay , impossible , to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious , money worshipping parasites , and that is exactly what we have in this novel
i like john grisham , but the king of torts was a slow moving disappointment grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is fine , but he ends up putting the message above the story
owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk he comes off as arrogant , showing little empathy towards debra 's problems earlier on in their marriage \( eating disorder , depression , social anxiety \) he writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble debra was in , but instead are very embarrassing to her he comes across as a husband with no compassion it 's ironic that he goes on and on about debra 's poor choices in boyfriends over the years , and how they were always so controlling of her and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and debra did n't keep the house tidy and he did n't approve of the way she dressed ! ! seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated he repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is , his gpa , jobs , earning potential , etc but then admits that when they separated , he sticks debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off ! he says it was in her name , so she can have it ! owen shows how little a man he really is in this book debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid , and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart , she would n't have gone down the road she did i feel very sorry for debra after reading this book
this is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you 've probably never heard of if you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you
a sad reminder that history is written by the victors i wonder how americans would feel if al qaeda would write a similar book glorifying the 9 11 attacks disgusting
mark twain called the book of mormon chloroform in print and he was n't kidding it is by far the most boring read i have encountered \( i could barely get through it \) i am a woman of faith faith in god and faith in christ and i do n't know how anyone could believe this rubbish please , anyone who is taking this at all seriously do some research on the church ask some hard questions \( you will likely get a rehearsed answer , but it 's worth a shot \)
while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife i'm very tender when it comes to wildlife , and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle , i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos , then this is not the book for them otherwise , i would recommend it
i have nothing more to say than i 've already said in my headline lou dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me
i 've read every one of iris johansen 's suspense novels and have loved most of them the last couple though have been so painful to get through this one however , i do n't think i can even finish i read where someone called these characters cardboard , and i could n't agree more the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters , it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters makes me think of a writing 101 class now this should happen here , and this here , and this here and boom , climax , happily every after
mark rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in america most of his ideas are solid , but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word interesting to describe it did they actually read it \?
forget the tom wolfe comparison this book is simply boring ! i'm half through reading it , but i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen if nobody tells me that the second half is much , much better than the first , i'm going to throw it away \( which i rarely do \) how could i believe this excellent book review \( in a swiss newspaper \)
i appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there but this book has way too much i read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men
you know , i hate to burst the bubble of devoted trotskyites across the globe , but trotsky was just as responsible for stalin 's rule as anyone for leon to blame stalin is the height of hypocrisy without lenin 's apparatus of social repression and trotsky 's apparatus of military dictatorship , stalin would never have been
i thought keegan was a serious historian this book contains little to do with the actual war itself you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel indeed i beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a serious miltary analysis of the iraq war
the self improvement books how to win friends and influence people and talking the winner 's way are both way superior to this short book most of what you read is basically review if you 've ready other similar books and what 's present does n't pack enough substance or how to to make it really worth your time about half way through the book , gabor started presenting fresh ideas the problem , however , is that it was half way through the book not a bad read , but there 's so much better if you happen across it one day on the street , it wo n't do any harm to read it but i ca n't recommend paying money for something you already know , or can get for a better deal
the book is entertaining , however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent any time studying the ancient world to any degree you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events , biblical texts , and blatantly stretched \( pun so intended \) the truth on so much i 'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong , but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol if you take away any claim of being a historical reference , this book is good it 's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does totally not serious , but a giggle to be had here and there some of which is at the author 's expense
when i first got diagnosed with add \( as an adult \) i believe the exact phrase you mean i'm not lazy , crazy or stupid \? went through my mind finally , there was an explanation
have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on \? for me , that was this book if you like fantasy then you might like this , because that is the genre of this book it is about a jewish girl named hannah she goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door she opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream she now has a new name , chaya she now has to figure out what happened , and what she will do in this body it takes place in new rochelle it is old times it does n't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting she does n't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it
i picked up this book at the airport as i was heading to japan while staying with my in laws in the country , there is no english language anything this is all i brought so i had to finish it but it was a struggle
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
this book provides nothing new it is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck if you have 401k , duh , it does that automatically anyway , boring it also says to save money , do n't use credit cards , pay yourself , blah , blah , blah oh yeh , if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years zzzz ok , it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks one idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account upon reading this , i decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal 2 i 've been earning on my saving account and not realizing the latest craze started by ing , all the other banks offer an online savings account which offers 5 compare to the dismal 2 i immediately switched ! other than this part of the book , it was boring
the reviewer below who said more heat than light got it partly right this book is so badly written you have to wonder if the author 's other works were written by the same person not only is it sophomoric , it is gibberish had its author been unknown , she would surely have had to pay for the book 's publication incredibly bad , it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers
after reading deep south and flashback , i was looking forward to going back and reading some of the earlier anna pigeon books liberty falling has to be the worst of the pigeon series i found myself skimming over pages and skipping over the last third of the book to get to the end and hope the ending would make it worth the read it was n't
for someone who spends his career attacking politically motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science stephen jay gould is a paleontologist evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it
before i started reading zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance , the book had a lot going for it stellar reviews on the cover , an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at walden books in pocatello
i'm at page 116 right now the writing is lovely , the specifics dense , and the sense of place rich if the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say , i just ca n't go on with this story ! i'm going to throw the book at the wall also , so many embarrassing little holes if i were a librarian i would say , so dracula 's checked out go to a bookstore every bookstore in the country has a copy and if i were the cat , i would know i was a goner the second i appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph \( you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you 're going to fire it \) lastly , it seems like dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them unless dracula is related to our heroine that would be good will read a bit more
overall i found this guide pretty confusing , but i guess it is better than nothing there are better choices , and some may want to consider auto formatting software such as eazypaper and others
i read this book , it was okay but the story flashed back to much , and i could n't folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i would n't recommend it too slow moving , and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way
let me start by saying that i would have given this book zero stars if i could the reviews i 've read are all true this book is boring , extremely repetitive and a waste of time the only reason i finished it was because i paid for it
this is the second nevada barr that i have read i picked it up on the strength of deep south , which i thought was really terrific it was frustrating that nearly all of what i liked about deep south was missing from flashback
design of book is very poor pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story the translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
i was not impressed with this book it is just basic stuff i would have expected a more sophisticated analyis of financials from this publisher
i expected information about design , but this is just a self serving i am good at what i do book i am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture no proportions , no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first a waste of good money
if an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery , you 'd think they 'd have a lo say about it , right \? well , ford certainly expends plenty of words , but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel gazing group of stories mind numbingly similar in tone and temperament , the ten stories center of upper and upper middle class white , middle aged , married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity story after story plods cautiously along , poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way , with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite of passage for a disconnected male marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons , and yet ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it i have no idea what his personal background or situation is , but it 's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something if he was n't such a literary bigshot , there 's no way this would have been published it strikes the same note over and over and over , and is n't provocative , insightful , or even interesting ps if you were planning on the audio version , do n't ford is a terrible reader , sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment
essentially you get what you pay for this book is certanly not representative of what i have come to expect from national geographic
if hz 's sensationalist title gives you pause , you 're on to something the story preston narrates is , indeed , terrifying it is a story about disease , politics , epidemiology , history , geography so much could have been made of this story \( and so much has been , by far more capable writers \) preston , it seems , is only capable of going for the jugular hz shows no evidence of research \( it lacks even a trace of a bibliography \) , and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp , on the part of its author , of the history , epidemiology , or politics of ebola \( no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic \) from its opening page stroll through the air lock doors of a bio containment research lab , to its closing page 'death defying' romp through kitum cave \( how very brave of you , rp ! \) , hz is in full pandering for the cameras mode if this book was not a thinly veiled hollywood screenplay , i 'll eat my proverbial hat even this might have been tolerable were preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer hz is all cliches and lazy reporting it is an embarassment
most of the information is very theoritical and limited author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her in a nutshell , the message is that a dysfunctional mother 'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter \( s \) , and in turn , the daughter \( s \) may pass that onto her offspring \( s \)
the official censes of the ottoman empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million christians living in the provinces of what are now modern turkey western specialists who helped the turks conduct their censes stated that the turks purposely undercounted the christians and overcounted the turks so , there were many more than just five million christians there are now approximately only a hundred thousand christians in modern turkey the question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today we know that over a million surviving greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between greece and turkey in 1923 again , what happened to the huge difference of 4 5 million people \? to the 1 5 million massacred armenians , must be added three quarters to a million assyriac christians \( aramaic speaking arab christians \) and as many as two million greeks \( almost 30 percent of the greek people \) the author does not touch on the large numbers of christians who were enslaved by turks or forced to convert to islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number greek speaking turks around trebizon on the black sea
karl marx , years ago , gave a description of why this might be happening he followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make
pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers , whose very existence and relevance is due to that king what you will get from that kind of writing \? noonan was a speechwriter reagan administration sound familiar \? noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings probably she does not care americans are lucky that they never had any king noonan fails to provide any inside information how reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency aids , iran contra , welfare , deficits , funding mujahideens , cozy relationship with saddam instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a disney feelgood fairytale good ruler , happy citizens happily lived ever after basically , this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers do n't know already this is a writing isolated from the reality of 80 's \( which is nothing new in human civilizations \) secondly , she fails to understand that reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency including average hard working americans but she gives all the credits to reagan , except all the negative things , like iran contra in the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash a perfect place for the kings , characters of kings and the writings about them
my grandmother and my mother have read danielle steele for years , but i must admit i 'd never picked one up i was always more for historical romances but i wanted something different , had heard good things about her , so while at the library , decided to give her a try i have to say i'm extremely disappointed granted , i'm a fellow writer \( a very picky reader by nature \) , and an unpublished one to boot , but the writing could 've been better in my opinion the first five pages are all backstory of paris 's marriage \( no action , no excitement , told very history lesson ish \) and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between paris and her husband \( the inciting incident in the first chapter \) left me wondering , so what \? twenty five pages in , i could care less about these people i honestly expected more from a bestselling author
i wonder if im reading the same book the others are reading i'm on page 101 right now and it took me about 4 days to get this far \( i 've gone through 3 clique books in a day , so it 's not like i'm a slow reader \) the book is just so boring its like ive read all of this cr p before ! so far sam had a graduation party at her dad 's yacht , we hear about 2 new characters from a rival school who happen to be enemies of sam and her group and conveniently enough the two schools do something together , i forget what but it looks like it will be the opportunity for sam to get her revenge for getting poop smeared on her white jeans a few years back \( eye roll \) anna is incapable of taking care of herself at a time of crisis \( her car gets rear ended by some cliche white trash woman \) so her dad 's 'dont judge a book by the cover cliche' tatooed but hot new intern comes to rescue her , omg romance ! \( another eye roll \) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her , but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book ! it was so annoying
after having read and loved howard pyle 's 1968 classic press
so very boring i gave up halfway in i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time my sister liked it though
as i 've said before national hypnosis ! ! ! liberals want to dupe the masses into believing that modern conservatism and lberalism are different ideologies \( they both come from hegel and machiavelli the philosophies that gave birth to communism and facism \)
mr wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included the reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic work in 5 classes of 40 50 kids each day who ca n't read \( many are moved up so they can be with their friends \) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside
these are revised remarks since my comments about prediabetes and stop diabetes being the same book i got them both and felt somewhat duped
i have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow she did n't say how slow though but rather than take her word for it \( why should i \? after all , she 's my wife \) i bothered to pick it up and read it how i wish i had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale i cannot stand baldacci 's juvenile charactor dialog , but finish it i did though most of it i could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything i 'll stick with my nelson demille from here on if i want literary junk food
this book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information 's significance becomes blurred , if not obsolete the authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject , but they fail to analyze the information they present the reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included the authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective the only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph , and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences while this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages , the average reader 's attention is never captured students , beware ! before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life , reconsider your other options of reading material \( one option is another book by these authors that has gotten better reveiws
attention seasoned realestate investers do n't waste your time purchasing this book ideal for amatuer investors who want to add more value to their piece of real estate
i found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the sham \( self help actualization motivational \) movement is , and maybe even on why it is , but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it i thought , sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain washing in such a humorous way , that the author might have a sense of humor herself and i 'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well
a friend recommended this book which i unfortunately bought i feel sorry for people who think that this is writing the author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth if you want to feel good , buy yourself a bottle of wine , not this book
this play explores the same old turf as death of a salesman , but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development eddie is no willy loman , though , and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central , driving force like willy parts of the play seem borrowed from tennessee williams , and they do n't seem to work in this context there is some business about the romance of the old world italy versus the new world of opportunity on the docks of new york , and it is the only topic that is at all explored well , if still unsatisfactorily eddie 's dreams are represented in his pretty niece , catherine and unlike willy loman 's uncle , she is still an attainable dream that makes eddie 's life seem all the more petty , in comparison to willy 's he longs wearily not after what he could have had , but after what he can never have , as he is already married the death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced , tacked on ending , and alfieri 's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick there are better plays by miller , and many better plays by others
before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead as it turns out i made the best decision all i can say is `thank you fellow reviewers' this book was definitely not worth the purchase price my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a skilled writer it has everything to do with his lack of insight that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary i read the book , waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book
after reading the first book \( which was catastropha \) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series
this book reads like the blog of some angry person who ignores evidence to the contrary and embraces anything that agrees with him it was very hard to take seriously
since god is infinite goodness , we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion when we are comfortable , we are too shallow minded to realize that we need god since god knows that he is the only thing that we really need , he inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact so pain is god 's megaphone if some people , such as the jews , try to love god without going through christ , it is not yet god merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain hence poor god is forced to keep screeching at them through his megaphone but even people who try their hardest to love the true god , such as job , or c s lewis for that matter , cannot adore god as much as he wants to be adored , so he uses pain over and over again to plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls
i 've enjoyed johansen 's books for years , but this one was awful i'm beginning to wonder if she 's using a ghost writer totally ridiculous plot , trite dialogue i lost count of the times she used the phrase sophie said through her teeth i was beginning to wish someone was pulling my teeth rather than having to read this book johansen is capable of so much better than this ! i'm praying she is n't falling into the nora roberts danielle steel james patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher 's deadline
i am a chef and an avid collector of cookbooks i find the recipes of this book to be mediocre at best , terribly organized and lengthy i am not interested in lawson 's endless anecdotes , rather , i would prefer her stories to be replaces by pictures \( an essential for cooking books , in my opinion \) , of which there are none i was disappointed , and would not recommend this book to anyone for basic , great recipes , i would suggest any of ina garten 's books her recipes are no fail and the books are well done
this is truly a disappointing book it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels \( 1 \) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl \( the young female protagonist in the hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality \) , \( 2 \) devoted , super powered canine companions , \( 3 \) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped out rvs , and \( 4 \) evil bioethicists
sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that three junes was listed as a popular book choice the title sounded interesting so i bought it that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition it is difficult to follow the timeline , to understand the characters and where they fit , and to get involved in the storyline i will finish the book because that 's my style it has not been a book that i could not wait to get back to
as an admirer of theodore roosevelt , i was very disappointed in mr brands' book it appeared to me that mr brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic 's point of view while any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man , mr brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of tr 's actions tr was by no means a perfect man , however , history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents one gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of tr that mr brands'truly disliked his subject
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
when i started reading this book , i was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically correct word choice unfortunately , i did not find it to be particularly clever or funny on some level , it seems like the pc craze has subsided since the mid 90 's when the book was written , and it just does n't read as the brilliant critique that i expected we 've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix challenged that it just is n't funny anymore i suppose that this book worked much better when it was written , but it has n't aged well over the ten years since
the chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the french perspective by using citations in french with no translations i took 2 years of high school french but i'm not that good ! this could be overlooked except that , for obvious reasons , i was very interested to hear the perspective of french writing on this lopsided defeat the experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline , or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel i simply ca n't believe key citations were n't translated
i must admit i was skeptical when i first opened this book based on previous knowledge i had of mpd this book made me that much more skeptical in most cases of mpd or did as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist this case is different though on page 67 of the paperback copy i got , ms chase describes stanley \( her name for phillips \) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other her answer that she or as she claims her troops give is that it is through the use of thought transference which was known to the ancient greeks as she tells us later on i almost burst out laughing when i read that she also contradicts her claim that the alters do n't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters rabbit and sister mary catherine at the same time another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we' many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies the abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories , ufo sightings , satanic ritual abuse , and second sight i think she is not credible in the least there is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them she does let us know in the book that she is very creative , artistic , intelligent , and apparently well read i think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities the book itself is long , boring , anti climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end she also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities do n't waste your money on this book , unless you have to read it for a class as i did
this book just rambles on and on and never seems to end i do n't think i have ever been so disappointed in a book since i started to read it , i feel like i have to finish it i am just praying for that day to come soon i have to skip over entire paragraphs just to get through a chapter it is overwhelming proof that hippies should never write books
this book blew my ballz it was possibly the worst book i have ever read in my entire life although i am usually sleepless in seattle , i found myself falling asleep each time i tried to read it i advise no one to ever read this godforsaken book
i was there , as were several of my fellow sitka fire department emt 's and state troopers from the sitka academy the 6 of us , along with two parajumpers from the canadian armed services were flown through the typhoon winds , on a helicopter , out to the williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed we knew there was a doctor onboard , from anchorage , but we literally never met or saw him i'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up but that is where he stayed the real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend but i was disappointed to see that mr jeffers failed to fully research this book the role the sitka rescue teams played \( both on the williamsburgh and trying to assess fight the fire on the prinsendam \) was totally overlooked despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story which was the human side and had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event i was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out , was very sad at least we all have our commendations from both the coast guard commendant and the canadian armed services they knew we were there ! too bad mr jeffers did n't due diligence
tropic of cancer by henry miller not recommended
this book was a complete waste it was boring to read and hard to follow i finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion i never should have read past the first chapter read pop goes the weasle , or lake house by patterson just not this book it is hard to believe it is written by the same author
have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you would n't feel bad \? have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him \? in this story , the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he 's still a good guy because good guys do n't do bad things dizzing logic , huh \? throughout the novel , you review his senior year of high school with him it starts out with the story of how he got the nickname killer to why it 's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue the flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he did n't rape her he wo n't let her leave the room until she believes it the ending is less than satisfactory for me i would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice
jesus , talk about the little girl crying wolf when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew knows how to deal with what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption
this book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional this is absolutely not the case this book covers very , very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion i would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement
as a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler , this book was a big disappointment ! ! ! i bought this book after reading the reviews and wish i had n't paid more than 1 for it while the title the unprocessed child accurately describes laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with other unschooling literature the author , while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in love you forever who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son 's room at night to spend time with him sweet but a bit creepy the fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with laurie pretty much says it all the mother clearly has her own issues that i hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24 7 with her only child we have been unschooling each of our four children since birth challenging temperments and all and i feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them if you want to read a good book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter , i would recommend homeschooling our children , unschooling ourselves those authors offer more balance and eloquence than ms fitzenreiter
sheer and utter this hardly can be called a work of fiction had this been his first work , i could understand the grammatical mistakes , but this is inexcuseable the publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired
this was my first reading of jamaica kincaid she has a short , concise style , which made me often feel like i was reading poetry however , i felt that it also had some downsides , like stifling character growth in lucy , the title character comes to america to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother , who for some reason she hates i wish we knew a bit more about lucy , like why she hated her homeland so much it was an alright quick read , but had it been longer , i doubted it would have held my attention
hmmm i'm struggling to give agatha christie such a low rating she wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into not quick reads , but very methodical with lots of character development i do n't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow moving chapters , but i always do it knowing that i will be rewarded with a great ending christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the who , where and why were finally revealed in the end i was shocked again at the end of this book not because i did n't know who the killer was , but actually because i already knew who and how i tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious very disappointing christie books i would recommend instead abc murders , and then there were none and murder of roger ackroyd
dr northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies , stages of life and medical procedures however , i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced , with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women as a catholic whose best teachers were strong minded , compassionate religious sisters , i felt offended by her slur against nuns i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing , but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research
ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up i first bought the book , 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on , so i bought the audiobook \( 5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on \)
the book is interesting , and well written it contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners
i read this book because my english professor spoke highly of it i would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas so why did your bridge fall down mr engineer \? oh , i dropped my structural steel class so i could do a course in another language i do n't think it 's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person does n't even possess one actually i think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this it might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one this book insulted my intelligence and i would n't even recommend it for a laugh
i have a book of ross' by the same title , but the cover is different \( remake \? \) but most of my problems with his theology come from his advocation of the big bang theory which has numerous scientific problems \( quantized redshifts to name one \) and serious theological implications if the big bang were true , then there were animals before man animals that lived and died the bible says that man 's sin is the reason why we die and suffer if death was around before sin \( for the wages of sin is death \) then what good would jesus' death on the cross have been
i'm sorry , but i expect more out of a book beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric after reading beautiful books such as cold mountain and brideshead revisited , to mention just two , i found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that i knew it would be a plot driven monstrosity that would n't be worth the read at page four i was fed up with the author 's style and slammed the book shut
i was excited to see the book with recipes for the 14 super foods after reading steven pratt 's book , but was very disappointed yes , the recipes do use the 14 super foods , but also use such ingredients as shortening , cheez whiz , and yellow cake mix hardly healthy ! if you are interested in eating good , healthy meals made with the 14 super foods , do n't buy this book
this year , 60 of college entries will be female look at this spring 's honor role listings last year , 78 of honor role members in my community were female schools are fails boys not girls
i'm not sure why sony , which now owns i dream of jeannie , decided to colorize the first season of this series whatever the reason , you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on amazon com that the original black and white version of the first season is worth a lot more the reason for that is simple i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in black and white and for a television fan like myself , that 's the only way to watch the first season
if you do n't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection in my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released
denzel washington is great but angelina jolie he is even better the movie itself is pretty scary , to tell you the truth it 's not pleasant there are some parts you do n't really need to see the plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next i recommend watching it with somebody , cause it 's not pretty but it 's a good movie
i rediscovered this after a long time this is a great series i had never seen this in its entirety and look forward to seeing the third and fourth which i understand is not out yet its a gem , love the storyline and costumes , so authentic looking and of the period , even the dialogue i wish there were more of this genre
i bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me i enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also times and styles may have changed , but i believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did simple , but great movie my only regret is that it was n't close captioned
r j the raccoon \( bruce willis \) was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend 's \( nick nolte \) cave and accidently destroys his food , he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies he finds a family of animals \( gary shandling , william shatner , wanda sykes , steve carrell , eugene levy , catherine o'hara , avril lavigne \) and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans later on , the home owner gladys \( allison janey \) hires professional exterminator dwayne \( thomas hayden church \) to kill them but can rj save his own life or his new friends 's \?
9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling it takes a look at the workplace from a woman 's view
i wanted to do a grad school paper on something i was interested in researching and i picked hip hop after working for an underground hip hop magazine , i 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that i was too young to understand \( being born in '81 \) i visited the university of hip hop in chicago , interviewed underground artists , and went to breaking shows in the illinois area although i thought i was very familiar with hip hop , after working with this magazine , i realized i knew nothing
honestly , i was n't certain about this film , in fact , at first i actually believed it was related to chocolate i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised upon first viewing , i did not laugh as much as the second time yes , i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time second viewing was a belly full of laughter
if you like action , shooting , explosions , fire , pain , torture and revenge , this is a movie you 'll love and , it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role a great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality
he kept it real thats all i can say aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word i just cant help it everybody in the hood cusses but anyways
frankly , the idea of a secret service agent having an affair with the president 's wife is way out there in the first place \( michael douglas not withstanding \) if you like keefer sutherland \( as in tv 's 24 \) you will probably like this movie \( his name could have been jack bower in this flick too i thought it had good action , writing , acting and directing i would not mind seeing keefer and michael teamed up again on the same side i bought the dvd , but then again i collect movies for the actors
i saw this show on pbs and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on i do n't know of any other way to be able to see yul brynner 's commanding king and i performance loved it
i had been aware that once there was a show called mr show , starring bob and david , and that it had been on hbo but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend , when the power of satan um , compelled me to pick up the first two seasons all i gotta say is praise satan for leading me to this glory !
this comedy volume is absolutely great while i'm a fan of the series , i thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next definately do n't watch season 3 before seeing these seasons , because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree it does n't move as fast as some comedy out there , but it all fits together better than most of what is on tv today
i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on \( it 's been some time now \) and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter \( that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon \) a heartbreaking , beautifully acted and must see film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore , and it 's a shame
some classic episodes indeed all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households archie bunker 's old fashioned values were being challenged it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker 's views were organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood \? not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion \? quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone
great movie , great actors for such a sad part of the u s history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed \( especially stonewall jackson \) we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction , but at the end of the day it 's not very important , because the historical interest is preserved
without jessica alba let 's imagine the same film as the deep with jacqueline bisset a real sexy looking woman not a teenager chica lookalike with very poor acting it seems the same director had a better choice in blue crush
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation
see this
i liked this work out it is very easy to follow the instructor , who is very likable , gives good instructions she gives each dance move a fun name , so it is easy to remember i do this work out when i want to work out , but do not have as much energy as usual or i will do it as a warm up to another work out it always puts me in a good mood i liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section if you are looking for a hard core dance fitness work out that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat , this is not for you if you are looking for a fun , easy work out , then this is for you
my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around ! the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great simple music but very creative i signed up for updates on laurie berkner 's website so i can find out when if she ever comes to town so my daughter \( and i , of course \) can go see her she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters , who i do n't care much for i have bought this dvd cd combo for all of my friends who have kids
good introduction to qigong mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful overall relaxing and precise
i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3 where is it \? i hope that it is released soon it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending ! a little unfair to the consumer do n't you think ! it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is is that correct
ohhhh ! i caught this movie on regular tv and even with commercials it was good i bought it so i would get the whole movie i have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family a really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you !
this is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves the storyline is great , but this should have been the last dvd things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over 20 that 's bogus dvds can fit way more episodes on a single disc , and it 's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately the cowboy bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start , then dropped down to 4 now it 's just getting worse at this point i'm starting to regret buying the stand alone complex series instead of renting it i am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out , though throughout the series i think disc 4 was my favorite
of course i enjoy this movie , i ordered it after so many years of searching for it i love salsa music and the dancing
julie johnson is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a new jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship , longing for knowledge to change things she considers herself stupid , sneaks science magazines to read when her overbearing husband is n't around , and finally gathers the courage \( while staring at the stars one night \) to change her plight she takes a computer course , passes her ged and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life along the way she discovers other secrets about herself , buried in the facade of a life she has led she changes , relates to the world in a different way , and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life' when her husband returns promising her change her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels , but in the end this friendship cannot last , as her girlfriend does n't have the same goals
if you sort of like edwin mccain , get this dvd , watch him live , and you will fall in love he has such passion for his music that can only be seen , and felt during live performances his amazing voice , is just as amazing live , and he and his band , can jam ! ! the energy is high , and its a great time !
the much celebrated fourth season of nbc 's long running medical drama , er , is the recipient of two 1997 1998 emmy awards , three 1997 1998 screen actors guild awards , and one 1997 1998 golden globe award
a very successful comedy highly recommendable players are magnificent
i quite enjoyed watching this film , which is why i give it four stars , even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic so , why did i like it \? joan cusack , matt dillon , kevin kline \( in that order \) and also a passably funny script at least one that is well structured for a feel good viewing experience
i'm not big on anime , but watching one episode got me hooked the voices , the animation , the story , the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch samurai champloo
if you are bored with kurosawa 's faithful decpition of historical samurai \( and who would be \? \) , if you think the samurai genre has been overused and outdated then get ready for the hip hop remix version of the age old genre samurai champloo directed by shinichiro watanabe , the man who brought us cowboy bebop and 2 shorts in animatrix , with character design by kazuto nakazawa , kill bill vol 1 fame , we are treated to a world that would have made the wu tang clan feel right at home the action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other one follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play the music is all modern hip hop , no moody asian flare here
i loved this play
the good earth must be considered a milestone movie as yet , there is no dvd but one packed with out takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome there was no oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939 otherwise , the good earth would have 'taken home' that award !
i 've seen this movie on tv a few years ago , but it just would n't leave my mind , so i ordered the dvd
what a cast ! mark wahlberg , reese witherspoon , william l petersen , amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl \( witherspoon \) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend \( wahlberg \) of course , the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance william petersen \( csi \) is outstanding as the witherspoon 's concerned father who has way too many issues himself this film is a hidden gem buy it you will not be disappointed
otto preminger 's exodus is a very well made film this is a big film and director preminger is a master at handling films of this scale he is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature well , that is preminger 's style , straighforward and technically proficient movie making
i got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college good grief since when is a musical ever realistic \? \? especially one that is geared to kids hello \? \? ! ! it 's not supposed to be realistic ! if you expect realism , go elsewhere but if you want to have some fun with a great message not so subtly woven in , then watch this movie kids love it \( mine do along with anyone else i 've talked to \) , and the message is just terrific it 's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes , dislikes , hobbies , etc , no matter what anyone else thinks i love it ! i ca n't even begin to say how much better this is than grease , the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be happy relax with your kids , go get some popcorn , and have some fun with the wildcats kids from highschool musical
my children \( ages 6 and 11 \) absolutely love high school musical my son 's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring , and he 's very excited about trying out for a part i enjoyed watching it as well the musical is set in a fairy tale high school , but what musical is n't a fairy tale \? puppy love and teen rivalry all done in a family friendly disney way walt would have been proud
ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house 8 women , every one of them with their affective lacks , their tribulations little miseries , sorrows and disillusions each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered marcel
this is , as most critics agreed , the best of the trilogy abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish , including a few twists along the way i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd
there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story what did the macho man think about it \? unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth would these be included in a future macho man dvd set \? i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy , especially in front of a huge live audience including kids i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80 's yes , that 's hardcore deadly scary hardcore ! that should not happen in the first place the story involving steamboat is well covered it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing there should be a line which should not be crossed how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head \? human error \? hm nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today 's standard enough is enough we do n't need accidents ! they may be an unevitable part of sports , but not part of entertainment
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70 's show' which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although , you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest woks the way it does billy nighy gives an a list performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly , it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars yes , i prefer pirates over tlotr although , perhaps my comments are premature since at world end has n't even been released yet should that be a dud , then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out
i 'd give 4 stars for this dvd release the movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies to relate the atmosphere of an old 60 's soviet eastern is not easy to an american viewer , and i believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice besides that , it 's a must have , particularly for any russian ex pat
one of john hughes best films , ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him i love this film
i was amased at how very well acted , directed and written this movie was the dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips everyone was well cast it is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo film cliche it transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it 's a gay movie if you hated go fish like i did , you 'll love this movie and go whew for this film it saves our lesbian cinema souls ! buy it ! you wo n't be sorr
leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir , and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in the man who was n't there \( typically , they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember heisenberg 's name \) chain smoking nebbish barber ed crane \( billy bob thornton \) makes the only decisive \( and dishonest \) action of his life , and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several , mostly not so innocent , bystanders in the man who was n't there , the phrase decisive action is an oxymoron everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance everything that happens from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face changes everything forever , and always for the worse set in 1949 in santa rosa , calif \( a tip of the hat to hitchcock and shadow of a doubt , perhaps \? \) the man who was n't there looks perfect like every other coen film , it 's a marvel of production design , and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty black and white look of such classic noirs as double indemnity and out of the past thematically , however , the man who was n't there resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant , much better acted remake of edgar g ulmer 's detour , in which the characters drift in a low rent sartrean hell , totally the victims of fate but whereas detour is more than the sum of its parts , the man who was n't there is less the coen brothers may believe in chance , but on the screen they leave nothing to chance , so that everything in the man who was n't there is too perfect in the end the film has the same overstudied , clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except fargo \( it must be admitted , though , that only one coen film the hudsucker proxy is ruined by that quality \) the acting is as superb as in any coen film thornton in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense , hangdog gravity there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton 's philandering wife doris james gandolfini as her paramour and boss jon polito as a shady businessman michael badalucco as thornton 's motormouth brother in law scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies and especially tony shalhoub , nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider , defense attorney extraordinaire
i was not privy to the world of christopher guest until a friend of mine told me that if i liked `drop dead gorgeous' then i would flip over any of guest 's films the video store only had one in , and that was `best in show' and i'm sooooo glad they had it this film has to be one of the funniest films i 've ever seen , a complete riot from beginning to end as a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the mayflower dog show the film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy there 's jennifer coolidge and patrick crenshaw play leslie and sherri ann ward cabot \( total spoof on the whole anna nicole smith scandal \) , owners of a prize winning poodle who 's won `best in show' 2 years straight , and with the help of lesbian handler christy cummings \( jane lynch \) hopefully she 'll win for a third then there 's harlan pepper \( christopher guest himself \) , a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist and there 's power comic couple eugene levy and catherine o'hara who play the flecks , owners of a terrier , who struggle with mrs flecks long line of previous lovers there are lovers stefan scott \( michael mckean john michael higgins \) who spoil their shih tzu 's and each other but finally we have the star couple of the show , the neurotic meg and hamilton swan \( parker posey michael hitchcock \) , owners of beatrice , and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' weimaraner who 's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex their antics , arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film , and their chemistry is pure brilliance the film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken way to serious , and with fred willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish
a great behind the scenes look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us
next friday was so much better than the first one with much more funnier scenes and this movie is reccommended for everyone
this is a sweet comedy with alot of formula but it works ! sometimes you have to fight for love and it takes something like a movie star moving in on the girl to push you to action predictable but funny is n't love worth fighting for
ferris bueller \( matthew broderick \) is a kind of hero to every high school aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be , really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world , and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye \( alan ruck \) , a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film , ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick day for him , his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick , he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his life is not fair sister jeannie \( jennifer grey \) who suspects something is up , as does the sly but not so slick dean of students , ed rooney \( jeffrey jones \)
highly enjoyable tale of the life of marty maher , the irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become west point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years despite personal tragedies , and through two world wars , maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished army officers' academy , including future legends like omar bradley and dwight d eisenhower tyrone power is excellent and compelling as he portrays maher from young idealist to elderly sage , irish accent intact all the way the scenery and west point pageantry is fun to watch \( although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the military academy \) interestingly , there 's not really all that much football in this film there 's a little , but it 's mainly the story of maher and his family , and the young men he came to love like his own sons with the flame haired maureen o'hara as maher 's irish wife mary , giving a radiant performance sentimental in that '50s way , of course , but the legendary director john ford \( working with a cast made up of many of his favorites \) always puts a bite behind the sweetness
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts i thought , yeah , right but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio it is up to you or you can choose from the basic low , medium , or high intesity workouts this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part i 'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
pbs did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together it covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films the documentary includes many interview pieces with kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like also , there are comments from noted japanese film historian donald richie as a kurosawa fan watching this on pbs when it aired , the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour it is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century
this is a work of genius it is creative , original , funny and well done that being said , it is probably not for everyone
nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even william shatner would envy , and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical as anybody who has seen this show knows , the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for british comedy \( although , as children of the three stooges , americans are , i think , accustomed to somewhat heavier handed comedy \)
i am a huge anime fan , and this is by far the best lemme just say , god i ca n't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan a few hundred years ago , the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct there are people there , even today that report wolf sightings occasionally \)
okay when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago both sets were released by universal fear not , i am here to tell you about the differences the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies like it 's closest cousin the high school reunion collection , the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same movies the breakfast club , sixteen candles and weird science the cover art on the dvd 's is the same , no new bonus material with each film that i detected
one of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel , how they make us react dave , a wonderful ivan reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time kevin kline shines as the president 's sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the the chief executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide the rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully the relationships between dave and the first lady as well as dave and the head secret service man at the white house are especially touching i absolutely love this movie you will too
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act , but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer , presented by material in the film , is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind or even lord of the rings you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh , to gross you out , to surprise you with its clever twists of plot , to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds , and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates' treasures
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing more to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids \? not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , another gloomy but solid \( underrated \) '80s film the worst '80s film is bright lights , big city do n't say i did n't warn you !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we don't have the same taste in movie
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids \( and quite possibly yourself \) entertained during an otherwise hectic holiday i laughed , i cried , \( really , i did \) and i just really enjoyed it
i 'll admit that i'm a johnny come lately to the madea series , finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his alter ego , the opinionated , pistol packing , chain smoking \( never lit , by the way \) madea , have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans , mostly african american , nationwide
inliked the film in the theater and i like the film now the plot does not drag and does not bore
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine , the actors well chosen , the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october or crimson tide whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self sacrifice
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive , honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength , courage , wit and willingness to go up against the big , tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools
this is an excellent movie if you like war flicks it made me angry being from the vietnam generation also it shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men the acting from all the cast was top class i highly recommend this movie it may be slow at first , but the action later is amazing
richard dryfuss and holly hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of a guy named joe full of great flying , laughs with john goodman , and a special appearance of audrey hepburn in her last film you 'll love it
as you can tell from my other reviews , i own a lot of kathy smith dvd 's the reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue ing and instruction she always cues from your point of view , when she says left it 's your left , which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen
i'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand you receive one of the greatest mgm musicals ever conceived and it 's bolstered by quite nice extras that much you can be assured of
i loved this play it provided drama suspense , comedy , inspiration , and great music tyler perry has done it again
i just watched this movie last night i came across the title on someone 's myspace and being a jared leto fan i wanted to watch it i had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting
a deeply emotional film about addiction , love , and family just to some , but when you watch this film you take something with you , something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted , life each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending , really depressing movie but worth a look at least once marlon wayans and jennifer connelly were extremely good but ellen burstyn broke my heart her performance rocked
i teared up when i heard the music from the theme song to the electric company for the first time in 30 years i grew up with this show and now my children are learning from it too thanks to whoever arranged to have it released on dvd it was and still is a great show
i agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say baby einstein videos , however , i still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay my two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although i agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland i love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the dvd my son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days the video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing
according to imdb , moulin rouge was shot in 1 37 , not widescreen therefore you 're not losing that much to view this in 1 33 \( full screen \) format
i really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work i'm a photographer but not this line of work it was an interesting glimpse into their lives i wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries , personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it
one of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves , alaska , and the inuit , i could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it a mid level analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time \( he has his doubts early on \) is chosen to go north to investigate the arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters , including a crazy like a fox entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score , a number of wacky bit players who i can easily imagine were not actors , but the real deal , and every bit as eccentric as they appeared and an endearingly sage old inuit of few words but many eloquent silences

who could ever forget the image of happy go lucky manuel fidello \( spencer tracy \) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle , infectious portuguese accent , yo ho little fish do n't cry do n't cry if you 're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from spencer tracy 's signature movie , `captains courageous' released in '37
after spinal tap , this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown but like st , it is right on these wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it 's satire , it 's real if you hate even the idea of folk music , skip it or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people if you were there i was it 's a real hoot \( enanny \) ! sadly , here in california , they were to be found en masse at every local 99 cents only stores i realize this is not for everyone , but neither was spinal tap give it a try
when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70 's generation you 're talking about paddy chayefsky 's brilliantly written black comedy , `the hospital' which was released in `70
it 's a more vulnerable patton in a white coat , running a hospital , and it 's all great fun , with a good story from an oscar winning script you have to love it when scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow you half expect him to finish her off with there are brave men dying out there !
my favorite dvds are concerts , festivals , unplugged etc i was going to buy the cd and amazon pointed me to their dvd i prefer dvd surround sound to cd stereo plus you get something to look at i heard the demon days songs on the radio , and liked them alot this is an excellent dvd you may want to check out bonnaroo , cross roads , string cheese , even the doobie bros oh yeah and eric burdon and the new animals
season 5 is one of the best of all ! archie and mike are still doing what they do best arguing about anything and everything the best part of the whole season is when archie finds out that the meathead has bought the jedderson 's old house next door arch 's expression is priceless ! ! ! i'f you buy this set u wo n't be sorr
most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone , but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time u2 fan and had seen rattle and hum , but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late 2005 the fact that the music is wonderful is a given , but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage , including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel off stage as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i could n't ask for more
it is a wonderful complement to my lucy collection the tango scene is some of her best physical comedy ! !
the story of a young award winner of a filmmaker 's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get his first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by christopher \( spinal tap \) guest it 's a cynical and hysterical look at how hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis
first of all , i have lost count of the ammount of times i have seen this movie but every time i watch it i get goose bumps this is how affective the movie is
one of the productions of which he is the most proud , robert redford 's all the president's men should be required viewing \( and the woodward bernstein book should be required reading \) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young , untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate break in until it led to the highest office in the united states redford 's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary , so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level , still unsure as to where this would all lead , but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics
peter palmer and leslie parrish are excellent in this fun , politically skewering musical comedy the songs are upbeat fun , especially put em back sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates
lil abner is a delightful comedy musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it 's comic book coloring it 's also superbly cast the film 's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae peter palmer \( who starred in the broadway show \) and leslie parrish but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles \( it 's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway , although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era \) it 's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals , as the dogpatch crowd might say
i saw this movie before i read the books the books are much funnier , and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film still , i liked the film and especially baby sunny i thought jim carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions \( as always \) brought the character to life i think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film , the essence of the story was captured , and is entertaining but i do recommend reading the series before or after watching the film
haunted castle and alien adventure are great , but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of encounter in the third dimension makes it better than the other two the film is an excellent way of showing how 3d started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in , other than the entire movie itself i do wish the mine ride was longer though \( the one which ends with the big , round , stone ball slamming into the tunnel \) and there was more shown of the t3 experience sure , the jules verne journey to the center of the earth ride certainly makes up for it , but the effects in the shorter example were awesome , like the bats best of all , the film does n't look all that dated cgi wise for a 1998 production now i 've definitely got to get the sequel misadventures in 3d dvd noticed something stupid in the credits for encounter instead of saying cassandra peterson as elvira , mistress of the dark , it redundantly reads , elvira as elvira , mistress of the dark unlike the other 3d imax films , this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2d wise of course , the best is 3d since that is the whole point of the story anyway i highly recommend this movie to all 3d collectors
that this film is dedicated to the memory of david maysles should tell you all you need to know about what 's in store along with his brother albert , david maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60 's and 70 's \( gimme shelter , salesman , grey gardens \) , and joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition the story of the poor and semi literate ward brothers is touching and engrossing , despite the squalor in which they lived , and this early 90 's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice absorbing , and worth owning
lets face it woodey allen has produced so much a few of his things sort of slip past some of us i have found this one did for many people
love this dvd so much ! the actors are super , and the story is hilarious !
i was not in a rush to get this , almost forgot i ordered it , so it was a delight when it arrived , thank you very much for a smooth and speedy transaction
the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation it 's hard to even describe really but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in the plot however , is excellent the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers they do what is called committing someone for their sins these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there
this volume gets right to the heart of the plot , and raises important questions who really is gohda \? where is the next refugee threat coming from \? who tried to kill the prime minster , and what roll does he play in the individual eleven \? is there a terrorist virus causing another stand alone complex \? can togusa finds his way clear of criminal charges \? also , we all know the major , but what of her past \?
lady and the trap has been an enduring disney classic for 50 years now and it 's amazing how well it holds up after all that time the hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch this film is an example of disney animation at its classic best
i have been a casual fan of the radio version of prairie home companion for decades , although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time , usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it , and while most critics kind of liked it , there were a few grumbles however , i thought the film was excellent , and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans i liked all the casting , too robert altman is not a favorite director , but when he is good , he is very good , as in m a s h and nashville when he is bad , he is terrible but here , i thought he done good same with garrison k i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review , but i liked him in this
this is the best film i 've seen in perhaps six months or more the direction by turkish italian director ferzan ozpetek is consistently interesting , intriguing , beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually the film is beautifully cut , and the acting , particularly by the fascinating giovanna mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also giovanna , is first rate
this film is a real delight , but it also has a message about our consumer culture do n't miss the deleted scenes i'm sorry the director cut out the saints in the loft in particular what a powerful image ! but it 's there on the dvd so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film
this is a very good , well made dvd which is fulled of idea to prepare dinner for your family
i bought this at \( yep , you guessed it \) the grocery store , which was a very clever marketing concept on martha 's part there was only one dvd left it contained classic recipes for chicken , beef , fish , vegetarian and other main dishes if you think you already know how to make classic , everyday dishes such as meatloaf , think again because martha 's variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one i had n't tried before my family loved it
often overlooked , robert altman 's 'the long goodbye' is arguably one of the films exemplifying the 1970s and , although far less dark , ranks alongside antonioni 's 'the passenger'
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway , i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too for one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! !
wow ! the plane crashes and the story goes on the starnge island the suriviors , the killers , and others who is who before the crash , and who becomes what after the crash
what 's so 'ugly' about this movie \? because it depicts the truth \? to all you parents out there , this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis i know because i was once a teenager too , and this movie hits the mark this is what happens when parent 's do n't have a solid relationship with their kids this movie is not ugly , its just the straight up truth which most people do n't like to recognize it 's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized
i loved gone with the wind this movie lets the lovers of gone with the wind know what happens it is a great ending but set your mind and be aware that the rhett leaves something to be desired and scarlett too but it is a good movie and i love knowing the ending
this is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place the premise is sillier than the first film \( which was pretty silly itself \) , but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense enjoy the ride and try to forget that the lost world ever existed
my girlfriend told me about this movie up until then i have never heard about it this movie was alot better then i thought it would be i enjoyed every minute of it it kept me on my toes the entire time
when i sat down to watch a movie called three woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is shelley duvall , my first reaction was that i would be better off drinking a nice , tall glass of toilet water but , that reaction was short lived it is rare for me to enjoy a movie that i was determined to hate from the first second , but this movie forced me to pull a 180 the ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go it is a trance like movie i found that i could n't stop from watching yet , i didnt know why i was watching very bizzare , and very mezmerizing not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however
9 11 was meticulously planned out by our government if people do not believe me , go read and study that day like it was your babay and you 'll find the truth i was a bit skeptical at first as well now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in this is n't the united states of america , this is the beginning of a new world order do n't believe me , we 'll probably never know , because we 'll be spoonfed our news on the war in iraq by the corporate media that controls and censors what we see and don't see ! do n't think so \? you , along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in iraq by watching cnn \( censored news network \) , or fauxnews it pains me that people still do n't realize that there is no fight for democracy in iraq its a fight for imperial ambitions , we need iraq for oil , and to set up a puppet government so it does n't scare israel , our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of radical muslim fundamentalists no one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself , instead of relying on experts who know what is going on i thought we were intelligent people , us americans \? most of you ca n't even figure out wat the problem really is its our corrupt government
i am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice beautifully filmed excellent performances
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around , but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when mr arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on , for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times , due to my obsession
greetings is an offbeat satire from a very young brian de palma starring an equally young robert de niro the vignettes focus on three friends first there is jon rubin \( de niro \) , an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating peep art this would consist of filming private moments , and then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re creating the peeping tom experience \( more of this in de palma 's much better 1970 film , hi , mom ! \) however , if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film , you are going to be disappointed de niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance , especially in comparison to his two co stars his best moment is off screen as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art \( she repeatedly forgets not to talk \) but he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career , at least until he started making credit card commercials
this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema , and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective , although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later , i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny , but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it
this is a great family movie , a fresh take on enchantment stories it 's rather in the style of e nesbit 's books , using contemporary references i find it far superior to many of disney 's usual works it 's enjoyable for adults and kids
ella of frell \( anne hathaway \) is an unusual child as a baby , a bumbling fairy godmother named lucinda \( vivica a fox \) gave her the gift of obedience every time anyone gives her a direct command , she must obey
get ready for this workout the beginner dvd 's are butt kickers for a 1 2 hour workout the advanced dvd 's are killer i definitely got my money 's worth with this set there 's no excuse not to be in better shape if you have this product
all about the benjamins is a funny movie mike epps is funny the polt of the movie is very interesting and funny i recomend that you watch it soon if you have not seen it yet
the series was always delightful because it was fun , done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek pierce brosnan was great and stephanie zimbalist was a wonderful partner loved 'em both nice to be able to see it again because i enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on tv like it today
once again the saga of motoko kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold as manga , as a pair of feature films , and now a tv series , it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time , a topnotch group of secret agents , and a beautiful woman with a story line that is n't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human , program and soul , get crossed every day
i like pretty much all of annie leibovitz 's photography , and if you have noticed her work on magazine stands you 'll probably enjoy the book too
its original idea challenges us to look in a new way at the things we do n't have the answers for kevin costner is joe darrow , an emergency doctor , who 's pregnant wife emily , also a doctor , dies in a tragic accident in venezuela while he 's in chicago and trying desperately to reunite with her joe does n't find her body and this leaves him haunted his emotional pain is beyond belief , he buries himself in work one day he remembers that emily asked him to check on her paediatric cancer patients and he starts visiting them then unusual things begin to happen the children who have had near death experience have seen emily and are trying to pass a message joe darrow 's already shattered world is now turned completely upside down he is forced to change his beliefs this is dramatic and painful process and its end is a triumph of one of the greatest love stories ever told ! kevin costner 's performance as joe darrow is absolutely brilliant his extraordinary talent shines in this complex and emotionally demanding role !
ok sue me , i love this piece of cheese from the 70 's a remake of sorts of the last man on earth , heston is a doctor who used a expermental sereum on himself after a bio war has wiped out most of the world the people who are left are albinos who ca n't get out in the sun \( i e vampires , as they were in the book \) , and they want heston to die for his crimes \( he is free of the germ and was an army doctor so they blame him for the end of the world heston spends his days tracking them and killing them and his nights whole up fighting off the mutants
sunset boulevard is a drama that reveals the unsightly day to day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense joe gillis \( william holden \) , a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers , holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on sunset boulevard while walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool , he is shocked to discover it 's occupied by old silent film star norma desmond \( gloria swanson \)
this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation
this film is the best film that disney has in it 's live action collection ! every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life i really like all the extras on the disc as well i like seeing how the film was created , looking at deleted scenes , learning about the history of real pirates , and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of walt disney himself
update \( jan 27 , 2006 \)
in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed
i 've seen the pilates infomercials for a while now , but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements when i found this inexpensive for dummies dvd , i decided to give it a try what a workout ! i consider myself to be in moderately good shape , and this workout can definitely be felt ! within the first couple of days i immediately noticed a change in my posture , and a good burn in my abs , hips and thighs i highly recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to pilates
ok even for a guy , i thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth , but to my amazement i thought is was a great story and lived up to all that i have reviewed i would suggest the movie to all
newman , redford , robert shaw as the bad guy , twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so how can anyone not like the sting \? when i saw it on the big screen upon its first release , i did not think it deserved the oscar as best film of its year , although i enjoyed it now , decades later , and after having seen it perhaps 20 times , at least in pieces , i think it one of the best achievements in movie making in its century it has style , and a consistent sensibility , and logic , and on first viewing , it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top i ca n't imagine that anyone over 30 has n't seen it yet , but if that 's you , fix it as soon as possible it is a primer in how to write , direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience newman 's drunken card player on the train with shaw is absolutely classic
hector elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill aside from his superlative work as a doctor on chicago hope he has been often cast as a sideman in films the trusted aide , the sympathetic boss but often in supporting roles in tortilla soup he takes the leading role in a mexican american remake of ang lee 's eat drink man woman
it is the ultima of cgi video game movies i must buy for final fantasy addicts
if you love john waters then you 're already right there with me i would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie grease but is a more self aware film
although subtitled grazia 's island \( grazia is the lead role , magnificently realized by valeria golino \) , respiro could have well been called scenes from rural sicilian life , as the scenography , cinematography and tableaux like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line respiro 's locale is lampedusa , a tiny island far off the west coast of sicily about the same latitude as malta , this place is about as remote as it gets tunisia is closer than palermo it can be safe to say that italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades this is italy of de sica and mascagni , not fellini and prada the men go out to sea , the children play , women pack fish , old black clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky
respiro is one of those italian treasures of a film , this time written and directed by the insightful emanuele crialese , that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story respiro mixes the gut level italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by fellini
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies , though i think the lost world is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies , monster movies , or horror movies should own all three , i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies , but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger , more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two , you will definitely like the third movie
now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004 a relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them
if you are not familiar with research , this nice approach to a scientist 's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies besides , this very interesting and moving film , with high level and homogeneous performances , will show , the closest it can , the early facts about such a terrible disease i strongly recommend it i have seen it with my 16 year old son , but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age a bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience
i 'll make this short and sweet i used to work in spin i did advance , which is creating media events for politicians in other words , for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information
watch this and be inspired by the awesome herbie hancock the recording sessions are great the music and the movie flow along like a terrific jazz solo , riffing on all kinds of themes but herbie brings it together into a whole just watching him play on the piano is a treat if you 're not that familiar with this living jazz legend , check this out and you 'll admire both the man and his music
your milage may vary but i found this movie white knuckle intense and extremely provocative there is little danger of giving away the plot it is not particularly complex three stupid , arrogant american teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from finland to the former ussr , which at the time was very much the ussr and a very bad place for americans they make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate so far so good , but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the russians who mistake them for spies some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving , that i 'll keep a secret for ya i can promise you one thing if you are american , after seeing this , you 'll salute the flag , think real hard before traveling overseas and i 'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border
bruce almighty is a great movie it about a newsreporter , bruce nolan \( jim carrey \) , that has a bad day a work \( gets fired \) and thinks that god is punishing him so god \( morgan freedman \) meets him at a warehouse and tell bruce that he can have all his powers then bruce has fun with the god powers gets his job back , but sometimes its hard to be god you 'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out \)
here is the reason why somebody like bruce cannot be a god simply because the world would suck ! ! ! and his life too it 's a very good movie it shows that people ca n't always have what they want very interesting and unpredictable plot hilarious
excellent , great camera work , very good sound and commentar
the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a well paced and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen
this 2 disc set is packaged in a very nicely made large metal box with room for the other volumes in the series if you feel the need to remove them from the original cardboard packaging \( you 'll lose your otaku status if you do \) the box is well adorned with imagery from the series and is a very good idea and generous from bandai considering that we 'd have bought a normal cardboard box with joy thanks bandai appreciated
in some of fred astaire 's movies there 's only one excellent reason to watch , and that 's to watch fred astaire in you were never lovelier there are three other excellent reasons rita hayworth jerome kern johnny mercer the four of them have concocted a romantic and funny south american fable that features some great dancing by both astaire and hayworth and some memorable songs by kern and mercer
city by the sea is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances , particularly those of robert deniro and frances mcdormand both oscar winners , they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection , they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands james franco , although obviously in to his performance , comes across attempting to repeat his emmy award winning role as james dean the mannerisms , the false bravado , the hurt and pinched face , are trademarks of the late dean , and franco seems to enjoy using them again william forsythe approaches a caricature of his role , but it 's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl anson mount as the moralistic cop dave simond , gives a strong , understated performance , showing that all cops are n't bad george dzundza as deniro 's partner is also good , as is linda emon , as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where deniro confronts her after dzunda 's death apparently at the hands of deniro 's son
rather than menace to society , this movie should be titled , the unfortunate victims of a racist society my heart bleeds for the real world counterparts of these young men , caught up in the unending battle for survival in south central la , and other such areas all around the country
i wanted to see a movie one evening , and it really did n't matter what movie , i just wanted to get out of the house , and get to a theater i looked at the listings and decided to see in good company , and i'm certainly glad i did i found this movie to be very entertaining , and very enjoyable to watch i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well
eddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people i enjoyed watching this movie , and i feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it when it first came out and ten years later it 's still just as funny basic plot ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he 's alone on new year 's night anyone who 's had a bad night day on the job can relate to ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations from the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion , to a gangster 's bratty kids , a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken hollywood people who want to make ted part of their hazardous \( and very gross \) bet i do n't want to give too much away but i will say that i will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever if you love a good , dark comedy this is the movie for you

i loved ben vereen in the show wanted the music for my ipod , too very satisfie
this show undoubtly is one of the greatest around i have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give american 's their own monty python show and they failed because their show is better than monty python their show is not better , it is of equal and noteworthy standing monty python is history that will never been changed they have gone on to do many other creative things bob odenkirk is doing miller lite commercials and i hope he does something like david has with his new appearance in arrested development i can honestly say that this show is not better , yet it is close , to monty pythons flying circus both are great shows
hospitals are inherently spooky scenes of so much pain and death , the very walls soaking up the agony through the years , they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there the hospital in infection \( kansen \) is in particularly bad shape losing money , unable to keep staff , the doctors and nurses working there are under qualified and desperate into this unstable environment comes a strange patient , with a black , infectious rash slowly , the rash spreads , revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human 's body , slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation but all is not as it seems , even then
i find the breakdown of each step concise and easy to follow the instructions also contain tips for safety which is an assurance for beginners like me would be sharing this with my pals and recommending it to whoever wants to lear
at ikiru 's opening , i started to have real doubts about the film i had heard that this was kurosawa 's best , and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down
this is a great film that preceded the onset of the jlo out of sight is a great showcase for jennifer lopez 's talent as an actress it is a shame that she has n't been presented with more great roles , like that of karen sisco , in this film karen is a d a , who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude she has a chance encounter with charming , compulsive bank robber jack foley \( george clooney \) their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would be kidnapping of sisco in her own car it is no surprise that sparks fly however , this does n't downplay the complexities of their star crossed encounter
this was one of the best movies of 1998 , but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience when i try to think of superlatives to desribe it , the one that keeps coming to mind is cool
i did n't think it would be that great and only saw it for joshua jackson , but the plot twists were really good and i enjoyed it a lot and of course , kate hudson , whom i adore , \( even though i did n't pay much attention to her in this one \) but yeah , i really liked the end and this is where i first heard of norman reedus then i saw the boondock saints d this is a good movie and is very underappreciated
wow this movie is outrageous it was a great movie for both ice cube and mike epps they were both great in next friday , so i was ready for this movie i recommend this movie to those who enjoy comedy with their action there is a lot of both here i also recommend friday after next , because ice cube and mike epps are in that as well
the seconf gig is trying to be good i only watch the show just to see the action the story is boring i love the being opening scene with the music playing even the animation is a little better then the first season and its a bit more mature then the first season
if you are a ghits sac fan this dvd is a must ,
this dvd has wonderful workouts i think the flexibility of 10 min workouts to target certain areas is a fabulous idea it keeps me motivated to keep going
i have a few friends who do n't like cartoons i guess they were brought up on hannah barbara drek and it turned them off of the whole genre when i run into this attitude , i pull out spirited away and my neighbor totoroto show them the beauty , subtly , and power of animation
i first watched this performance on pbs great performances it is amazing i'm very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on dvd rachel york does a top notch performance in the leading role the rest of the cast is up to par there have been other reviews that say the music is dated , or other such nonsense , but do not pay heed to them premiered in 1948 , the musical is based on the taming of the shrew \( shakespeare \) , and the music and lyrics are done by cole porter sometimes referred to as his masterpiece \( which i agree with \) , the production never drags or disappoints the lyrics are extremely witty \( a trademark of porter \) the music keeps you humming along for days
this show is great the 5th season was considered so so by critics but it is truely halarious see 'the ski lift' for a classic curb episode
happiness can be delicate in just one swoop , it can stolen out from under you , just when you least expect it the results can be often devastating some can never recover the family in the italian film the son 's room has found such happiness , but when tragedy suddenly strikes , they 're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache
this series is awesome , and i am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over it speaks to the depths of the soul of a man having experienced intense pain , though not in war , i find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series this bonding is what men were meant to do , not just in war , but in our every day battles the sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional i recommend this for any group of buddies , or even church groups
very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade
not only does the movie signs offer a wonderfully different kind of alien ufo tale , but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet the story 's true question is this does everything just happen by chance , or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand \? signs is the story of hope lost , faith put aside because of intense pain and grief , and how one man 's relationship with god affects the lives of those around him we were amazed by how truly moving this film is , as well as how humorous it can be , and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast does everything just happen by chance , or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand \?
this movie is obviously not for everyone it 's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour 's nope , instead you get the muscle a cranking huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in this film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart , soul , and body of every other thing in existence in an ever changing world this film is a big orgy of questioning and who does n't like questioning \? this film , in its own right , is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films
she just keeps getting better and better i love this woman , she makes us all look at ourselves and laugh over situations that are hurtful i personally will keep an open mind and try to copy some of her down to earth common sense a lot uf us have let go of for whatever reason way to go girl
one thing about arrested development that i forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years what i found funny last year when i was watching the show is just as consistently funny now in fact , now that i understand the style of humor better , i think the show is even funnier now
this is a great dvd about cage matches it has a lot of violent matches on it and a lot of classic cage matches but the reason why i i am giving this 4 stars is because most of the matches on here are jips \( matches joined in progress \) it would have been better if all the matches were full but on disc 2 it has 7 full matches but that is still no enough matches this dvd is worth a buy but remeber only 7 matches are full
i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years , and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 workouts this video is incredibly challenging , but i like that i can do the level 1 workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd
i am absolutely in love with this movie it 's a real documentary , not a mocumentary , but it is hilarious the special features on the dvd are n't amazing , but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful
in the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from andy griffith in 1957 's a face in the crowd , master director elia kazan gets similarly stellar results from natalie wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920 's kansas in the same year as her maria in west side story , she has never been more affecting then she is here as deanie loomis , the local butcher 's daughter deeply in love with bud stamper , the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero they are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry , but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents
this is the best batman volume yet ! the old robin \( dick grayson \) , travels around the world and becomes nightwing a new robin fights by batman 's side \( tim drake \) , and batgirl is part of the group many villains look different clayface looks more like clay , and bane looks more and act more like a freelance assasin i will now tell you how good each episode is
the back to the future trilogy was excellent the item was in perfect condition and arrived quickly my husband , who owns a delorean , was happy to get the whole story and we have enjoyed watching the old movies
this is my favorite movie i like it all screenplay , director , actors , etc believe it brilliant
whats not to like about ct \? i own this dvd and the audio double cd thats it believe me , thats all you 'll need what really makes it worth it is the commentary a fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the dvd i can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do that humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this dvd a must have !
the boys take the stage on their hometown for a silver anniversary concert and pull out all the stops guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid all the songs are represented here that ct fans expect and are delivered with verve all band members are represented here , and even former bassist jon brandt joins in for his album cuts the dvd offers up a nice selection of extras including rick nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage \( and on stage of course \) cheap trick wails and all is right in the world now for the negatives from this release sound is just okay , after some heavy eq work i was able to get a very good sound from my sony 5 1 system , but camera work is indeed lacking cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position , but that may have been an editing problem all in all i give the performance 5 stars and production 3 stars \( a very generous 3 stars \)
this 1954 musical release is just too good too fun to pass up adam \( howard keel oh my god , what a voice \) needs a wife and zeros in on milly \( jane powell \) to drag back to his oregon territory farm and six unruly brothers the tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge milly makes believers out of them the brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town whoops , they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed in for winter
you know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again ! i pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video best educational video i have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other brainy baby videos try it you wo n't be dissapointed !
this movie may not be for everyone , but to me it 's highly memorable
this definitely is one of the best movies to own ! ! if you have n't seen it yet , you should if you 've seen the movie blood in , blood out , then you should definitely see this one if you have n't seen either one , then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately \( if you want to save \)
an intriging suspense film with a shocking ending the clues are obvious throughout the film , but the viewer is , nevertheless , surprised and possibily amazed alan rickman shines as david weinburg , the social climbing husband his performance shows his versality as an actor for viewers who like suspense dark harbor is a must
this excellent dvd gives us a remarkable version of martin scorsese 's film it has been color corrected by scorsese himself , and remastered for superior sound quality
welcome to the lower east side , where the high rise apartments of the super rich abut the tenements on the riverside here joel mccrea , a poor would be architect , is infatuated with rich girl wendy barrie , while poor girl sylvia sidney pines for him , all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets into the scene strides humphrey bogart as a wanted killer , coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the dead end kids \( in what would be the first of many screen appearances \) , of which sidney 's brother is the leader
this continuation of the anne series on screen is very well done , and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did the only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers what it really does is just focus on a few key incidents , and drastically truncates anne 's college and teaching experiences morgan harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of roy gardner , sophy sinclair , old mrs gibson and pauline , and elizabeth this installment ends with anne and gilbert becoming engaged
what a complilation ! much better than what availiable out there on him it was good to see some of the old clips from the sixties of marvin i know that there 's got to be more i especially liked the clip with tammi terrell i was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing that 's the stuff of legends i hope motown continues this series of dvd 's with their other acts
brilliant is an often overworked phrase , but in the case of hamlet starring mel gibson , the word cannot be used enough for brevity 's sake , i will save zeffirelli 's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing this review is for chris devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult shakespeare script devore somehow makes it better were he in london , late 1500 's , he would have been a collaborator , making will 's work the pearl it is today my only plea is that , at some date , we will get to see gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared
harvey milk was the elected supervisor of district 6 in san francisco when he was murdered along with mayor george moscone on november 27 , 1978 , by fellow supervisor , dan white \( who later claimed the infamous twinkie defense \) the film the times of harvey milk firmly places the murder of milk , a gay politician , into the politically significant context of the times the crime , the verdict , and the sentence served were all shocking this film tells the story behind the headlines
the danny boyle directed trainspotting was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades , i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty star robert carlyle , as violent psycho begbie , swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high
calling all black sheeps of the family it is never too late for your family to come around in this simple yet powerful story , april and her mother learn that sometimes , those we have the most conflict with are those who are most like us painful as it seems , we must all come to terms with dissapointment and overcome our personal fears of rejection when revealing our true selves
awesome movie , great for laughs and you do n't have to be high to enjoy it this is n't ghandi or shawshank redemption it 's not supposed to be the best movie ever made but it does give you the laughs , so just keep laughing and stop taking it too serious
an excellent movie about a smart conman who eventually ends up rendering his skills to the fbi
this dvd is explaining things better than the previous version , where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc
i cannot recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie , which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business , that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business , it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world
warning ! this is not for children seeing death , real destruction , and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9 11 is not for the young
this documentary gives a brief introduction to al jazeera , which , if you did n't know already , is the main arab language newschannel it is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it 's willingness to go where other , stated owned and controlled arab networks wo n't tread in this sense it is more than a mere arab cnn in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media
i found this dvd to be well produced and engaging to go along with the powerful content fantastic loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching
this movie will make you laugh , cry , and think it 's definitely a good date movie bring a box of kleenex though
seems like there was a time in the 70s where mainstream filmmakers took their art and their audiences seriously this gem about courtroom corruption is one of pacino 's best movies and his final courtroom monologue is as good as any in film
this has to be the best of the alien films ! this film , although not as scary as the original \( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien \) , it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also , this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on , buy the collector 's edition of the first and this and enjoy
i was a bit skeptical about jogging in my home , but wanted a little boost from the two mile walk i had been doing if you are at all skeptical , don't be ! i have used 4 of leslie 's programs and for me , this one takes the cake it 's fun , it 's fast paced , and it works up an awesome sweat you can feel the calories burning with this one it 's well worth the 10 or so dollars
product was in great condition i got the product quickly and was very satisfied
i woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of fellini satyricon someone is mortally wounded , the blonde guy \? and lies there dying , watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired , gitone , and some dancing leaping black guy i think
this is too good to be true after purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and i sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place for the next three hours , we were absolutely shocked and entertained this has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created its got it all comedy , drama and twisted minds i have to admit i 've taken a few lessons from jill and her methods do work seriously though it was just plain amazing and i hope series two will be out soon it is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the brady bunch the lamest thing ever to grace television for the rest of us , well nighty night highly recommended
gilbert gottfried is a genius thank you for making a dvd that puts so many dirty jokes where they long together ! of course i knew a few , but i learned so many more ! gilbert 's delivery is priceless , and his impressions of comics like bill cosby and jerry seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier
more than male and female more than your view or her view or my view or any one person 's view of what makes male and what makes female and everything in between sexuality \( gay , straight , bi , asexual , etc \) is different than gender \( male female \) and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other
i am not sure why the first person would direct people to read j michael bailey 's work or why the second person would say that it is as if j michael bailey wrote this himself one he could n't have because it is a documentary , and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community and he was forced to resign from northwestern university as the department head , because of his illegal uses of his patient 's information in his book
i have found pick your spot pilates to be absolutely perfect ! i can choose which spot i want to work out for the day or do them all i usually walk first then add a 10 minute pilate workout to wrap it up while my muscles are still warm i would highly recommend this workout video
an excellent comedy , kindergarten cop , brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal what complicates things is that it 's arnold schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher
hard bitten cop john kimble \( arnold schwarzenegger \) gets more than he bargained for when he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to pursue murderous drug dealer cullen crisp \( richard tyson \) while at the same time protecting the man 's young son pitted against a classroom full of rowdy , 6 year old moppets whose monkeyshines try his patience and test his mettle , kimble may have finally met his match in more ways than one
my 3 year old son loved this movie he sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video it was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together , they both had big smiles on their faces the pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams my 3 year old says when i get big i am going to fly blue angel 5 i highly reccomend this video
since i 've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items , i'm not gonna repeat anything about each show \( see individual reviews for that \) i will just rehash what i have all along despite its missing pieces from the book , the original is still 5 star material the in betweener is only worth it 's value because it is a disc copy \( as opposed to a tape copy \) my advice , buy the original separately , and read the book to get the real missing years if you are building a library of all richard chamberlain , then buy both or this combo but be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged missing years has to offer \( again see separate review \)
i found this series to be fun , gritty , and lifelike the characters in the precinct remind me so much of guys i used to work with on the job certainly some artistic license is taken , but for the most part , this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs denis leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian , but a really talented character actor his supporting cast fits well , and all in all i would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of rescue me , or denis leary
a great behind the scenes look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us
this is probably one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen those who do n't think it 's funny are those who are easily offended if you are easily offended or politically correct you probably wo n't enjoy this film
loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries very funny and moving yes , i'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !
one of the many hit tv shows inextricably linked to the 1980 's is the a team , an action series with plenty of bombs , machine guns , and bazookas where miraculously no one ever seems to die ! short for alpha team , the a team is a vietnam era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the bank of hanoi having escaped from a maximum security prison , the four man team survives in the anonymity of the los angeles underground and with the government still hot on their trail , they 're forced to work as soldiers of fortune , providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices
it is nice to see bebe neuwirth in something other than cheers
from the sisyphean \( say what \? \) misadventures of a kind of black laurel and hardy duo \( anthony anderson and lahmard j tate \) who steal an atm machine with no money in it that they ca n't open , to the white dude who thinks he 's black , to cedric the entertainer who thinks that rosa parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus , to sexy and saucy eve who always loves the wrong guy , this is one fine piece of entertainment and ice cube as calvin who owns the shop ai n't so bad himself , although he sure has to frown a lot
the fifth installment of samurai champloo has proven , like the volumes before it , that good things come to those who wait with masterful artwork , great music and action packed scenes , samurai champloo has kept the industry alive below are my ratings for the four episodes on this volume

bend it like beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls the film sensitively portrays a young indian girl 's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being the film is enjoyable on several levels 1 \) there is the cultural clash between britons of various descent , 2 \) there is the hilarious lesbian mixup , and 3 \) the pure sports film all in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people
the sixth season is the only one i had not seen all of the episodes for when it was on and it does not disappoint \( except for the fact that this is the last season \) florida 's return and the addition of keith brings more to the evans' family home i enjoy watching each episode over and over this is much better tv than what today 's network television has to offer
an absolutely wonderful movie i love it so much that i watch it once a month or so ang lee did an amazing job of emma thompson 's screen play emma thompson won a golden globe award for her efforts just lovely
if playwright tennessee williams 's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller , they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters this is clearly evidenced in this six film , eight disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950 's and early 1960 's , all directed by true filmmaking masters probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now , the best of the set are elia kazan 's a streetcar named desire and john huston 's the night of the iguana the others are kazan 's baby doll , richard brooks' cat on a hot tin roof , jose quintero 's the roman spring of mrs stone and brooks' sweet bird of youth
when i first watched this tv movie , with an unusal turn by lucille ball as a homeless woman , i was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role , and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished bag lady although definitely within the tv movie league , this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy
oh my i love this movie it even makes me cry it 's sexy , cute , and heartwarming yes , it 's a little bit hokey but what musical is n't \? i am so excited to get this ! i love this movie i'm a huge musical fan and i 've been waiting years for this one they must have finally convinced whomever had the rights to release it on dvd i do n't know but i'm really excited ! one hundred million miracles ! i love that philosophy it makes me happy and it 's a miracle that this is finally available get your kids teens to watch it !
this is worth buying just to see
i 've heard it said that if you have n't read the book you 'd be lost in this movie i read the book and it was still a bit confusing ! i like this version of the film with all the extra footage such a fantastic looking picture this was i saw this in the theater when it came out i remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing sting was touted as starring in this film , when in reality he had a supporting role shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band , the police it was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater having said that , sting is actually pretty good in this film he sneers , he wise cracks , he fights , and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo of course , he gets killed in the end oh well
this is one of the best sci fi films from the 70 's not to be missed
although i enjoy pilates and yoga , i need a good workout that makes me sweat boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose but there are times where i prefer to feel the burn at home to that end , one of the best cardio strength dvd workouts i 've found is crunch boot camp training
well i thought it was going to stop at volume 1 but , i guess it did n't
we recently purchased this dvd for our three year old son who is obsessed with john deere tractors he watches it over and over again until we ca n't take it anymore the songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming along even if you do n't mean to if you have a child who loves john deere , then this is a perfect dvd for them
what do i think of when someone says disney ! \? hmmm kiddy films , girly stuff , princess \( groan , we do n't need more of that ! \) , dreams come true and cheesy \?
as usual with a bruce willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was interesting high tech house and mostly believable small town villains who are the hostage takers the underlying story of the rich dad his swindles detracted from it i think
to have these three classics for this low price is fantastic one film is the 1938 version of the classic christmas carol this one starring reginald owen as a very respectable scrooge if you can refrain from comparing him to alastair sim , you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of scrooge , and it is a fine one owen is truly miserly and wretched , as befits scrooge , and very believable the overall production is wonderful , the only drawback was the casting of terry kilburn as tiny tim way over the top , to the point where he is annoying but all in all , a great version , and ann rutherford as the ghost of christmas past is fascinating
i first saw this as a child during an afternoon movie event at my gradeschool little did i understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting , nor did i appreciate the subtle moral of the film , namely that good guys sometimes do finish first , by the very nature of their untainted goodness
ok , there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3d set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film the plot is pure ham and cheese a whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for dracula , frankenstein , the werewolf of paris , and the mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life \( i told you it was stupid \) before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height if you can accept a movie on the level of a police academy or earnest goes to camp then you should not have a problem with this only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like camp blood this is a masterpiece
this is a warm hearted , sweet story based on the cinderella fairy tale only we have sam , a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake sam carries on a secret email chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school , but she does n't know the identity of her prince charming
warning do not watch this movie if you are hungry ! if you do , within the first 10 minutes , you will pause it , and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either , but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes i adore this movie , it is a heartwarming , hilarious story about a widower retired master chef and his three very different daughters ang lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking the soundtrack is amazing , the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in , so that you can almost smell the food cooking i would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes !
based upon director and writer oliver stone 's own experiences in vietnam , platoon was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict the movie revolves around a young american soldier , pvt chris taylor \( a young charlie sheen \) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty the battle sequences are very gritty , graphic , and realistic taylor serves under the direct leadership of sgt elias grodin \( willem dafoe \) , but both men are under the command of staff sgt bob barnes \( tom berenger \) grodin and barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict , while barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war at its core then , platoon is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil though stone based the film upon his own experiences , there are scenes that have been embellished and the view stone presents is only one view of the war see the film we were soldiers for the opposite view as presented by stone in platoon
this is a very enjoyable and funny movie with a heartwarming ending all michael j fox fans be sure to get this ! there are many good supporting characters such as bridget fonda , woody harrelson , barnard hughes and julie warner
ok , this movied is a favorite having said that , i am less than blown away by this new transfer still looks a bit dull to me it 's a fun set though getting the box was a no brainer am i the only one who 's missing the poster offer \? a sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within well i do n't see it
clueless has been released on dvd before , with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features in 2005 , for its 10th anniversary , paramount finally released a great , if not cheesily named , dvd edition of this 90 's teen comedy classic , with such quotable lines as you 're a virgin who ca n't drive and as if !
this one is a classic not only to the general public but among submarine sailors as well it is considered the greatest of all submarine movies and with good reason almost the entire plot is onboard and underway the tensions that rise from long periods at sea and personality clashes among a large group of strong willed and independently minded men is real it is a must have for the second world war movie buff and submarine movie collectors the acting is superb and perfectly cast in each role the dramatic interaction of the characters will keep this one a classic for ages to come
what can i say \? this is a darn good action adventure flick there 's suspense , guns ammo , mummies , creepy crawly insects , tombs , and all that there is that make an action movie excellent this is one example of good escapism kudos to fraser , weisz , and sommers for exquisitely remaking the original mummy
i love when a blonde , assumed air head , realizes her dreams she even goes far beyond what she thought she wanted she is lovely , funny , smart , honest , and hard working who would n't love her \? so glad this movie was made
any collection that has the lost patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks that movie and boris karloff alone is something to behold but this collection also contains sgt rutlidge which a movie way before its time mary queen of scots , i was n't even aware was a john ford movie the informer another great and cheyene autumn i think this set has a little bit of something for everyone i just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of lost patrol or the original uncut version
if you enjoy movies with random terrorist executions , religious cults , andy kaufman as a mass murdering cop , alien abductions , bizarre sexual anatomies , etc \( do n't we all \? \) , you will love this one alone in its genre
in all her 48 movies , brigitte bardot never catches public imagination with more effect than she does here paradise on earth is just around the corner , she tells us , making the sparks fly off your screen this edition is the new one , by the way , cleaned up in 2000 you will appreciate its fine use of colors
this is a great movie ! i would encourage everyone to see this one even if you have never even known someone with this condition , you should buy this movie there are not enough movies like this one out there we need to support this type of film making i do n't want to give the plot of the movie away , so i wo n't go into great detail watching this movie gives me hope hope for so many people out there with this illness hope that they or someone close to them will watch this and will give this diet a try do n't give up hope thank you to whomever made this film possible
this dvd was a really good buy , even if you are just somewhat into incubus , but if you are a big fan , it 's a must have the home videos and tour of the tour bus and all the music videos and concert footage was great , with great sound quality also , there is a really funny take me to your leader music video it 's a really cool dvd the only thing i did n't like , was the massive song archive the background music was kind of annoying , and you cant just sit and watch through the whole thing , you have to click on different things but good buy anyways incubus rox
where do i start \? \? i am a 39 year old career obsessed straight female \( lawyer \) i fell in love with these guys brian \( gale harold \) you are the james dean of this generation , the man we love , adore , the badboy with a golden heart , who we all fall hopelessley in love with brian , justin , em , micheal and ted i became absolutely besotted with them and their funny , sad unbelievable stories and watched fixated episode after episode i laughed , i cried , i cheered and i lived the rollercoaster with them buy series 1 , you will be hooked just like i was , i have now viewed all 5 and keep going over and over them it dosent matter who you are , or where you come from , or what you represent this series is wonderful , and funny and full of love and hope its appeal is absolutely universal for all us dreamers and lovers and geeks
this dvd is exactly what i 've been waiting for and its finally available if you love kith like i do , its totally worth it to buy this dvd it was like swimming in kids in the hall heaven !
yes the movie is great but please tell me about the dvd ! how 's the quality , are there deleted scene 's , any bonus material \? i think there are about 115 reviews about the movie but i would like more info about the dvd itself !
perfect for kids age 3 and up highly recommended not a scary way to teach kids about safety , just helps kids stay smart on the safe side
i love all the rockford file 's and this collection is very good , i cant wait till the third season comes ou
unfortunely this movie was a sleeper in the theatres when it first came out but check out the cast ! jo ann fleet \( thoughtly modern millie \) and robert deniro in a comedy an a comedy it is it 's just pure fun and a great uplifing movie if you have the blues it 's so funny and you wo n't be disappointed , , , i promise
in this set of episodes , the battle city is down to the wire my favorite character , marik \( not yami marik \) is the center of the events most of his character is known in this set it seemed almost if yugi was only a side note for a while even though i dislike dub , this was still good enough for me
this dvd contains the basic techniques of krav maga system the techniques include attacks with hands \( mostly punches with closed fist , but also hammer punches \) , elbows , knees and feet there are some counterattacks and defences also included at the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack , target areas and stance movement as a dvd extra , they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training \( they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future \)
the picture quality is not very good it 's like watching the videos on an old vhs tape taped off of television i 've never seen a dvd in my dvd player look so not digital the selection is okay , the dvd opens playing a small clip of the tears for fears song head over heels even though that video is n't on the set but fear not , two tears for fears videos are here i bought this because i love the level 42 video for something about you , and i figured this was my one shot to get it on dvd buy this if you just must have it , the price is a bit much for such a short little collection , this should really be in the 12 99 or less range
capsule reviewer sam graham \( above \) is one king sized jerk ! tears for fears and swing out sister are two of the best acts that came out of the '80s and they are still going strong today ! the videos on this collection are some of the most obvious , but enjoyable nevertheless it would be nice if amazon would hire somebody to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music , instead of some supposedly hip idiot
this was n't all that funny
'mr smith goes to washington' is a classic frank capra film from '39 starring a stellar cast of some of hollywood 's best from the golden age of cinema it 's not only one of the greatest films of that era , but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of america was something to be proud of , not mocked yes it 's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions , however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us
i find this to be a perfect depiction of small town life being i lived for 11 years in a town quite like this one really enjoyed the movie and the acting i enjoyed most terry moore 's potrayal of betty
so this is the best i have seen from a terrible tradgedy i watched with friends with tears streaming down my face so factual and so sad
eastwood and lee van cleef what a
every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for jack ti jean kerouac ! to actually see most of kerouac 's fellow writer 's and poet 's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated genius that was this brother lowellian is in itself a magnificent production ! i bought this dvd today at a mall in new hampshire and could have bought it for less on amazon com ! just a few minutes ago i did order the dvd jack kerouac king of the beats on amazon com and ca n't wait for its arrival ! if it 's anything like what happened to kerouac \? then it will surely be another masterful production ! after i write this review i am going to watch this dvd again and experience the same chills as i did when initially watching it for the first time ! anyone that is a true fan of kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius ! to hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of kerouac himself is truly awe inspiring ! this production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is jack kerouac
i almost gave up on this one forty minutes in do n't you do that the ending is superb
there are so many reasons to love all things canadian national health insurance for all citizens , the novelist margaret atwood and certainly leonard cohen a group of singers got together to honor cohen by singing his songs nick cave , u2 and bono , kate and anna mcgarrigle , rufus wainwright , martha wainwright , anthony et al added to their performances are footage from many periods of mr cohen 's life , interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well we thus have this documentary that will delight mr cohen 's fans at 72 , mr cohen may have lost a lot of his voice he opines that he never could carry a tune but he has lost none of his brilliant self deprecating humor
i am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies the nobody character is based on trinity but with much more refined terence hill 's nobody has a certain directness and is a much fuller character henry fonda 's career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame if you compare this to his portrayal of wyatt earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him this is much more the fonda that one loves rather than the villian in once upon a time in the west \( itself a great film \) i love showing this to people that have never seen it they usally like it and then i move on the the trinity films
the reason i believe the ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a very personal , unexplainable level you see , the main storyline of the ring is the fact that this video tape has been created , and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual , twisted manner it 's up to a reporter woman named rachel to figure everything out she 's the main character of the film , along with her son
i find this film to be very different to most american films it is very funny in its own way and make you think about the true meaning of money and its relationship to happyness
i grew up watching this movie its a movie i seem to never get bored with paul newman is an awesome actor , and if you are a fan of his , this is a must have in your movie collection ! ! ! !
okay , the only real extras on the dvd is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it 's stars , but warner bros gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of both standard full frame and widescreen versions on one disc ! ! ! this movie is an absolute classic ! ! ! and it 's great to have it on dvd ! ! ! one of the great men in chains films ! ! ! the great cast includes paul newman , george kennedy \( in his oscar winning role ! \) , wayne rogers , strother martin , joe don baker , ralph waite , and many other classic character actors ! ! ! two thumbs up ! ! ! five stars ! ! ! a
being copied from tv the quality came out great good choise of show
given that pornography is a multi jillion dollar a year business , it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed , darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves , and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams , a simple minded , almost impossibly well endowed teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights is both a time tested star is born and almost blows it all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was
it is said that suffering develops character surely , when photographer zana briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in sonagchi , calcutta , in india , she discovered more character , and in smaller shape and size , then she might have imagined peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life into the world of prostitution to capture the images the world wishes not to see , not , at least , from this angle of truth , she saw between the life battered women their children
this is a wonderful story showing the universe can have aliens that are not horrors monsters or disasters for humans and humanity kids or adults can see a picture of aliens , not the usual us in a strange colored costume but folks we cannot see or even recognize as folks strangers with a problem seek help and after receiving help , return the favor
you will be laughing one minute , crying the next , then holding your breath to see what will happen next it 's a great all around movie , good for the whole family
this collection of the first four road pictures is well worth having the picture quality is excellent and all four films are loaded on one double sided disc but where are the remaining three road pictures \? this would have made the ultimate road collection disappointing
i love sub movies this one is one of my favorites good story and good action
most of this season is about topanga and cory breaking up and getting together i think the second season is the best though
just behind wings of desire is federico 's masterpiece
any movie that begins with a civil war ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me \( although my wife thought i have started playing the wrong movie \) then again , it was really upsetting at the film 's climax to see the c s s texas getting shot up yes , i know it is just a film , but the thought of finding such a civil war artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world , which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here
i did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80 's i had seen winds of war , however , and at that time , i loved it now , when i purchased the dvd 's , both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction i particularly have trouble with accepting robert mitchum as a virile , intelligent , sombre , alert and perceptive , about 50 something pug henry i wish some filmmaker \( curtis would be great ! \) would do a remake of this entire project making it into a 4 hour feature movie tightening up the script entirely \( apologies to mr wouk who wrote the teleplay \) mostly keep in the historical scenes but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea and do away with some of the long , soap opera dialogue scenes keep the holocaust part intact these were the most powerful holocaust scenes i 've ever seen and i 've seen most of them but have someone like kevin costner be pug henry \( or harrison ford \) and find a truly young , very vibrant natalie \( an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence \) , and a gorgeous , rather naive rebel leading man to play byron \( briney \) we need to feel their chemistry otherwise , what transpires \( briney 's desperate attempts to find natalie and his son \) seem over wrought and contrives i loved polly bergen as rhoda it might be hard to find anyone better , i think and you 'd need a new hitler one who is more like the actor who played him in winds of war
as with vol 1 , i bought this for my wife , and she is thrilled with it
of course the movie deserves 4 stars , however i wish i could say the same for the dvd what does it take for dvd company to release each dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs \? nothing !
this wonderful tv special from the 70 's is timeless and has great music by harry nihlssen \( not sure of that spelling \) the lesson is all about tolerance with lots of side issues of great value i am thrilled to own this dvd it brought back all kinds of memories for me both the story and especially the music it is a perfect addition to my collection of movies for my grandchildren
though based on a true incident that took place in 1914 , in the midst of a wwi battle among the scots , the french and the germans , christian carrion 's film joyeux noel nonetheless has a dreamlike , other worldly quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about carrion 's telling of this sad , sentimental tale
the documentary , guerrilla the taking of patty hearst is a good , solid look at the bizarre story behind the symbionese liberation army \( the sla \) how the sla formed , what actions crimes they committed , and how the group was finally apprehended the film examines the political climate in 1970s america , and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary sla political rhetoric aside , the sla careened through california on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks but more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the sla , filmmaker michael stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment
certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they do n't make movies like this anymore ! from the instant when the dazzling 3 d artdeco credits appear , we 're onboard for the ride of our lives , actually the lives of hero cary grant \( 1904 86 \) and eva marie saint the plot of this 100 percent attention keeper thickens as its characters sicken notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble james mason \( remember him \? 1909 84 \) and ever dapper leo g carroll \( who later played the ghost in the tv series topper \) superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors the elegant un an aerial shot of ant tiny cary grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands and closeups of mount rushmore , which hitchcock had dreamt of shooting , here becoming a backdrop of life and death drama of the 50 some films of sir hitchcock \( 1899 1980 \) i 'd rate this in the top three , with psycho and rebecca rounding out the bases
as i have found with most baby einstein movies , this one engages my very active 10 month old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy while i know that watching tv too much is unhealthy , she will not even give regular television a second gland \( which i'm glad about \) however , there are times when i need her to be more calm like when i change a diaper , try feeding new foods , and right before and after naps these movies have been lifesavers to me
from the sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that does n't has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence it also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son \( since a don juan son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime \) eventually it shows how the aging parents cannot bare the pain from losing their only son , the only way by which they can pass their genes , so they resort to extreme violence , even if the violence is somewhat spiteful if my son cannot pass my genes , your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason would n't be able to either that 's the subconscious motivation for murder conveyed by the genes
the chemistry of all of the cast members is perfect great ghetto storylines that are still relevant 30 years later
plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense , but it turn out funny because of that , comedy scene here wo n't be as class as the first , but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking , great cast in this set , however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star , so i hoped the third one will be best in the series
the film 's title paragraph 175 refers to the passage in german law forbidding homosexuality paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871 , and as a result , homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail dr magnus hirschfeld , a german jewish doctor , and a pioneer in the study of human sexuality , formed the scientific humanitarian committee with the goal of repealing paragraph 175 in weimar germany of the 1920s , an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals , and berlin became a homosexual eden but once the nazis took power , they enforced anti gays laws with a vengeance according to historian klaus muller , in nazi germany 100 , 000 men were arrested for homosexuality , and approximately 10 , 000 15 , 000 were sent to concentration camps of that number , less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made the film , gently and non intrusively narrated by rupert everett , is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps
ah , chris benoit , one of my all time favorites , which is why i was thrilled when i bought this dvd almost 2 years ago personally , i think the documentary is good and somewhat in depth , i just would 've liked it to be longer but it starts with benoit 's early years growing up in canada , then to japan , then ecw , wcw and finally wwe
this dvd provides benoit 's life story , which i found very interesting i believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection , but it was still pretty great

my wife and i saw love actually when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly yes , richard curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings , but it works and the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars
john ford must have felt very fortunate \( although he would have never have admitted it \) to have had john wayne and henry fonda star in fort apache

this movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to it demonstrates how connected we all are as people , and how seperated we are by only one thing our viewpoints
this movie has it all , especially for baby boomers of the early 1970 's blethyn , as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn 's loyal village friends top off the movie 's touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own

i 've actually been hoping for a live cd release , but i was more than happy with this dvd all the favorites are here \( only a minor gripe with the omission of echo and 11am , and the inclusion of priceless , but that 's just personal preference \) this is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity drive is an unexpected change , but being the most played out song in their lineup , the obscurity is welcome the musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous dvds , and each member gets to show off all their new tricks unlike some other bands , incubus seems to perfectly display each musician 's talents so well with each song , and this for me showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly every song is a highlight on this one my favorites are made for tv movie and sick sad little world
when i first found the broadway lost treasure serier on amazon , i nearly jumped up and down in my seat any broadway clips that i can get a hold of i definitly must get i bought broadway lost treasure i and broadway lost treasures ii together i must say the performances were very good , just because you ca n't call broadway bad the way the performances were put together , however , was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic \( jerry orbach , angela lansbery etc \) some of my favorite people , but i wanted i little bit more background information on the shows and things like that
i bought this as a dvd for home use i wo n't repeat the story as others have done so already i loved the story the plot was well put together and solid the acting was wonderful i have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time i see it i really am enjoying the fun of this film i 'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film it is made to be light with family values of what counts in life tim did an outstanding job as he always does the chasing scenes with tim on all fours becoming a dog the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling it is one of the funniest films i 've seen in a long time as an adult i loved it and would buy it again i'm thrilled to see disney making such terrific and wonderful films it was tastefully done the caged scenes were carefully done no bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the disney films and no i did n't perceive this as a film geared toward small children perhaps pre teens and up would be my guess to demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is it is a wonderful film with a great storyline ! ! corinn
das boot is an epic film that is very well done i loved the suspense and terrific character moments the thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a nazi u boat in the midst of the atlantic during 1941 wwii going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean the three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film
these are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals , people , flowers , water , etc i got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months they are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents , and for afternoons when i need a break to cook dinner she laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals , too the best part of course is the christian music ! these videos are top quality and my daughter loves them she gets bored very quickly with baby einstein
his words to the jury , a petition for strength for them against great odds , for himself against greater odds , for a system sometimes blind to justice , and for the victim of negligence who has no voice , puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'the verdict '
it is a gene kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies , but that 's pretty much where the on the town similarities end it is a surprisingly sharp , cynical story in which the protagonist 's dreams do not initially come true due to life circumstances betty comden and the late adolph green responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of auntie mame , bells are ringing , and what a way to go contribute very witty songs here , including the danubian tri liloquy sung by the guys and dolores gray 's thanks a lot , but no thanks and music is better than words \( delivered with a rich , smooth contralto \) i wish kelly and charisse had danced together \( the omission makes the film appear a bit empty \) , but my favorite numbers are still his garbage can dance through the streets and her sexy sweater and skirt dance with the boxers , baby , you knock me out and i would 've liked the roller skating finale better if it did n't have a big , looming , piece of the singin' in the rain set in the background
it 's so silly how michael moore is criticized purely based on what trashy fox news watchers see on tv they claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble , when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts for free clearly , this man is doing it all for the money
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated it has a great story line and plot although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one i really enjoyed this one has quite a few twists as well
maybe you had to be there maybe the actual film never quite measures up to what has been preserved in the memory of a certain generation and with literary roots in journalistic observations of the blandly benign cameron crowe , maybe it lacks the nerve to truly explore the teenage sex blues with the farcical abandon of its vulgar cousin porky 's
it does tend to lurch , but i give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest the end is not near , it is very , very near and possibly , it has already come and gone
i glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is intellectual because it is made anywhere but the usa in their eyes america can do no right my other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame
samurai champloo has been a great series , and this third dvd has kept that tradition though the last episode was weak , as most recap episodes are , the other three episodes made up for it , and then some around the time this came out , fans of the series were starting to buy the dvd 's more due to the shortage of episodes on adult swim , as the last episode on this dvd is as far as adult swim would broadcast \( they did start to broadcast more shortly after dvd six \) below are my ratings for this dvd and it 's episodes
peirce really suprised me in this movie he was always so pretty in his movies , he showed that he can play dirty an unlikely friendship developes between a regular guy and a hired killer pierce , the hired killer , is getting older and less steady on the trigger , could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience , or that he is close to his retirement years and dose n't have a real friend in this whole stinkin' world because of the business he 's in either way , he 's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water unusual buddy film , but , it works ! enjoy
i could explain to you all about each show but you already know what makes this collection great is the fact as to how it is packaged along with the price you get 5 christmas tv classics in a collectors case along with a 20 song sing a long cd and for 25 bucks that is a deal you ca n't beat that 's roughly 5 bucks a show not including the cd i got this set just so my 5 year old can grow up watching some of the good christmas shows that i did
two years later , the red sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in september thinking it never happened it was a utopian dream , the comfort of the drugged and sleeping
i'm mildly into anime , i only watch the stuff that i really enjoy this is the only series that has really drawn me in usually it 's just movies for me but wolf 's rain is amazing i ca n't wait for volume ii to be released on tuesday ! it contains the final episodes \( 19 30 \)
this anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network , and now is definetly considered a classic alongside cowboy bebop and others this is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people yoko kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect it 's so beautiful and fits the story so well the overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful
this is a very emotional film it induces emotion in the viewer , and for that i give it five stars i'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise , so even though i think it is an excellent film , i will just focus on what i think is wrong with it
i first saw this movie in high school in the theater i was extremely moved by the film , and it triggered a facination with south asia that lasts to this day i even work half the year in sri lanka now so for me , personally , this movie is of tremendous influence
i did n't have high expectations for this movie , but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times i 've always like tom cruise and he does n't disappoint in this movie but the real star is ken watanabe as the samurai leader what perfect casting ! and koyuki as the samurai widow was just plain gorgeous the hd dvd transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better highly recommended
i think this is a beautiful story about a man , who wanted to change his country he was not looking for his lost money , he wanted a new hungary the story about a great man , love through peace , war and blood a great story from the hungarian history everyone , who like dramas , the 19th century , real heros have to see this wonderful movie

i saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre i thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint not even close ! this movie is strange and should someday earn cult status besides i like watching drew barrymore
you go , diva ! ! i missed these videos , soooo cool ! ! deeper than the night , i think my favorite olivia song of all time so young , so beautiful ! ! and even hotter now check out video gold 2 just as incredible rock on , olivia !
their was a whole generation of little girls teenagers and young adults sitting down in the 90 's to watch 90210 and party of five they were even on the same night at one point it was a perfect tv night ! this show is amazing if you havent seen it your missing out and if you have you need to own this dvd ! i'm really surpised that this dvd isnt more popular i really think its because it hasnt been advertised these dvds need a little advertisements just to let the fans that dont search for it know its out thier buy it its worth every penn
on the face of it , a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as niche as you can get , but do n't overlook this film the relationship between harold and maude is truly endearing , and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic through maude \( ruth gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit \) we get a truly unique perspective on life , told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her if you like igby goes down \( a modern interpretation of catcher in the rye \) you 'll get much the same feeling from harold and maude , which is not so much a coming of age movie as a funny but deep look at love in all its splendours
a friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it wow ! our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over we used the dvd along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great before pre school started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 10
the stellar performances of jason alexander \( buzz \) and john glover \( james john \) make this movie , providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film the swan lake scene , while funny , is probably the most sad , as each character explains how he will pass on
this movie is a great movie to add to your dvd collection especially if you are a mob fan this movie is about corruption within the mob , about betrayal , about death and dying it starts off with someone trying to whack the don , and the family trying to find out who it is and why i'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story just watch it mario puzo 's the last don \( 1997 \) was great too
i do n't own this series , but i watch it on pbs it 's great they cover a limited number of words per episode , and i'm grateful it can get a little overwhelming my 2 1 2 year old daughter only does a few signs , but she 's able to decipher anything i sign to her i know mama , hungry , want , cookie for now that will have to do for mama is hungry , she wants a cookie you 'll catch other words from the songs go to the signing time website they have sample videos , and lyrics , you 'll get the idea a little at a time is good enough for me expert proficiency is not my expectation here five stars
i love this series and plan to buy more it is well done the signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting , or watch the whole dvd the word is first shown , then a mom shows the sign , then kids demonstrate \( including some use of the actual object , if appropriate \) my child and i have both picked up signs quickly from this dvd
the bad sleep well is a forgotten gem from one of japan 's great masters , akira kurosawa his other two shakespeare adaptations , throne of blood \( macbeth \) and ran \( king lear \) , are much more famous and well regarded , justifiably so if you have seen them \( ran is particular is my favorite of all kurosawa films \) however , this sharp and caustic adaptation of hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition it may be the most bleak subject matter that kurosawa ever tackled the corruption in the highest levels of government in post war japan
the thomas crown affair gets better everytime i watch it i spot something i missed hear music which i heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie actually hearing the windmills of my mind this is an unbelievably good movie , although i prefer the original 's ending
gosh the other reviewer , who seems to me , only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that oh , and on the dvd covers this is n't the first anime to have 'fan service' on the dvd covers look at kiddy grade , an anime that this tweedledum65 reccommends over r o d tv i'm not going to get into details on this anime , for good reviews check out www themanime org , i'm just saying i liked it , and if you 're paitient , and like a good mystery , i hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do
i ordered this guide so that i could understand all of the options and functions available on my new nikon d200 since it is a video that i could watch , pause , then continue watching it was easy for me to understand the explanations made a lot of sense there are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the d200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos i highly reccommend it
jude is a very powerful film it is also very disturbing , but it is absolutely a must see this is an adaptation of thomas hardy 's last novel , the film is n't exactly like the novel , but if you can ignore that then you 'll find that this is quite a terrific film just do n't expect exactly what you got from the novel over all i give it four stars
i waited years for this movie to be released in the united states as far as i was concerned , it was n't about the acting , as much as it was about the feeling the actors wanted to portray , in which they , profoundly , accomplished
murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a regular don juan to his neighbor winston , a family man
this is one of my favorite movies and i find it unfortunate that not too many people know about it i think it is important for people to know this story everyone should watch this movie simply because it is fantastic
the medium instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005 i usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal , which tuned me in however , it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating patricia arquette who was in ed wood with johnny depp plays alison dubois her emmy win for best actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry , but the on screen chemistry with jake weber who was in meet joe black and plays her husband joe is riveting they fight , spat , try to mask conflict in front of their kids , juggle an impossible number of real life tasks , and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of alison 's psychic ability i found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show , i still wanted to watch them over episodes of csi miami that i had not seen when i bought the dvd , i was hoping there might have been an episode i 'd missed , but i 'd seen them all between nbc lifetime reruns several times i'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing alison 's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together what impresses me about alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing in a world of violence , it 's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points in the episode in sickness adultery her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her as she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife , she finds that her best defense is the truth the two older daughters are also jewels maria lark as bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream , mom , please stop doing that ! sofia vassilieva as the older aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing david cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with arquette miguel sandoval as the district attorney manuel duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show \( perhaps we will sometime see more about his family \) while it 's hard to pick my favorite first season episode , the complex plot of a priest , a doctor medium walk into an execution chamber is a jewel , with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder the dvd commentaries and introduction to the real life alison dubois really give excellent background for fans of the show this is one show that reaches the level of art for me its excellence will make it memorable for a long time this dvd collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection bravo
i was happy to see a 'romantic comedy' that did n't line up with every other formula picture in the genre really fun stuff and some solid acting
this video is amazing ! my 6 week old son is watching it right now ! i ca n't believe how entertained he is by it ! these videos have been proven to increase a child 's iq , so i do n't feel too guilty about letting him watch
while i 've always loved blade runner , the so called theatrical cut was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation harrison ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped but hollywood , in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience 's intelligence and artistic sensitivity , stuck with it anyway , on the assumption that we needed to be spoon fed with sophomoric incompetence
this was an excellent experience my movies arrived very promptly and i have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times everything went well the dvd 's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition ! i will definitely order from here again
i really like this video because of its time \( 30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment 40 min total \) and i like the instructor janice is really good , calm , cues well , doesnt talk a lot , and is not overly inspiring she clearly points out the person who will be doing alternative low impact moves and then continues on there is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn no hard choreography either i use this w a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one i enjoy to return to
an amazing film ! not only is it a fantastic adventure , but the story is well laid out just the right amount of special effects , great music and good actors when seeing this movie at the theater i was not too excited , but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is not nearly as gory as gladiator , but is similar in style 5 out of 5
i have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding robert kennedy , and i 've got to say that this is , by far , one of the best pieces of work i 've yet to see the movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience 's attention , allows for us to actually feel what robert kennedy is feeling , to sense the tension during chaotic times , and most importantly , to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for america
i just finished watching most of it , and it 's not too bad the thing that most struck me is it does n't take very long to see which were the eras for superman that had the most influence on bryan singer he spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get superman started , then we 're quickly through the comics and the kirk alyn eras , then it slows down for a long retrospective of the george reeves years , both in superman and the mole men and the adventures of superman , then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the 50s , 60s and 70s , then stops again for a lengthy study of superman the movie , then briefly about superman ii , superman iii , superman iv the quest for peace and superboy , then briefly on lois clark the new adventures of superman and superman the animated series , and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of smallville , and then it becomes a big commercial for superman returns
saw the names kathy bates , barry manilow and julie andrews , so had to give it a view best film ever best lines in a film ever as well ,
only the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention it 's up to word of mouth to save it and it 's certainly worth saving nobody does the awakening matron like kathy bates \( see fried green tomatoes \) , and her grace beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice she needs it her daughter in law \( meredith eaton \) is an acid tongued dwarf with no inhibitions , and dan ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the johnstown flood after being dumped by her husband , patronized by her son , and deprived of her grandson , grace has no choice but to look after herself grace goes to england to attend the funeral of her idol jonathan pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life and meets his gay lover , rupert everett after swallowing her shock , the unlikely pair returns to chicago to track down pryce 's murderer the performances are all fine , the pace is feathery , the music easy on the ear it 's all whimsical and preposterous , and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you 're sitting home alone the ultimate test of a comedy unconditional love passes the test enjoy it and spread the word
i love this video i get up before anyone else so that i can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long it 's a fantastic meditation , though , that centers me for the entire day ravi singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear ana brett does the poses very clearly , and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses i have already recommended this video to friends
this dvd is a must have for anyone interested in beginning kundalini yoga the moves flow into each other easily and you can go at your own pace this dvd has everything meditation , relaxation , mantras , stretching , wonderful music , beautifully narrated and professionally presented highly recommended ! ! !
office space is a very funny comedy many parts of the film were a delight in the beginning , when everyone is stalled in traffic , i knew the feeling working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons \( ron livingston \) besides having a job he hates , he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is then there is his boss lumbergh an arrogant jerk life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion and demands of his then girlfriend
\( 3 5 5 stars \) listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly , ashen faced with blank stares where is the horror in that \? sounds like a typical sunday afternoon at the mall to me in fact , dawn of the dead \( 1978 \) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film more or less picking up where night of the living dead left off , zombies are on the hunt for prey across pennsylvania four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies they take refuge in a shopping mall , which provides just about everything they need they work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure the walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and do n't bring much in the way of strategy it would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they were n't so tenacious the four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the tv of bombing areas of high zombie concentration they have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere what does fate have in store for them \? the night of the living dead took place , obviously , at night and in the dark , which provided a much more frightening backdrop it was also in black and white , which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make up this is not the case with dawn of the dead , which is in color and takes place during daylight the zombies are people dressed as they normally would , but with their faces painted grey the result is anything but scary tom savini 's effects are hit and miss , though always disgusting nonetheless , this is a decent film that features some above par acting and a decent script the anchor bay divimax dvd is also noteworthy , with a clean transfer and dts sound mix an extra star for the effort
kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular bloodsport and like bloodsport , kickboxer is no doubt a van damme classic there are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences , however the acting suffers worse than bloodsport in that department as for the plot revenge go figure but we do n't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie hey , it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action fortunately , kickboxer delivers it well the movie begins with a couple of good fights right away about 1 2 of the movie is training sequences , but many are enjoyable to watch the final fight is between the villain , tong po \( played by michel qissi \) and kurt sloane \( van damme \) its a rather lenghty fight , about 10 minutes , which is nice above all else , they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on , and yes the result is some blood during the fighting kickboxer is the only martial art movie i know of that used this ancient thai style of fighting \( with the exception of kickboxer 2 and a small scene in ring of fire \) i really enjoyed this i also enjoyed michel qissi he had maybe one line in the movie , but still succeeded in making tong po a great villain , who also will return in the sequal lastly , we ca n't forget to mention the van damme dance napoleon dynamite would be proud also keep an eye out for ong soon han \( main villain in both bloodsport 2 and dragon the bruce lee story \) , who has a short fight against tong po about 1 2 way through the movie
i have trouble saying how much i enjoyed this movie the plot was well worn , but it did n't feel staid or plodding visually , the movie is simply stunning absolutely some of the best visuals i have seen in years the jim henson company outdid themselves this time
maybe you 've heard that it 's all been done before gaiman and mckean prove that wrong with this unique movie it really is something new
i'm another of those who saw this at sundance , and all the things i enjoy about gaiman and mckean 's graphic novels were on display the quiet humor , the intelligence , the delightful weirdness , the astounding visual vocabulary except that in this case , the words are spoken by good actors , and all those visuals get up off their feet and move
i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find
excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda , bono se entrega a su publico , buen sonido , buenas imagenes , magnificos extras lo recomiendo dos horas de u
my hat 's off to sean penn for having the nerve to take this role , and then really committing to the role , he committed way too much though his performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the sydney olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this dvd to the judges dakota fanning is as precious as ever and i hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years \( todd bridges , jill whelan , eve plumb \)
i am sam is superb to the core excellent performances across the board , and an emotionally involving story sean penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged this is a veritable tour de force for him but not to be upstaged is dakota fanning , who plays opposite of penn and is named lucy diamond after the hit beatles song sean penn 's character has to fight for custody of lucy , and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer , played by michelle pfeiffer , for free she helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor all in all , a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness one of my favorites
this , as you may have already read , was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view the live footage is as good as it gets , and the sound is flawless to boot this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers every song is a favorite of mine , and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet the bonus features are splendid as well if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about 1 2 of your day probably , there 's that much on here just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs , brandon recording warning \( a lot of this song is a capella \) , and incubus showing how funny they really are the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this , which is pretty humerous
this is without a doubt the dvd to own if you wanna see how 5 1 should sound and how digital video should look if you own an hd tv and have a 5 1 system you must have this the crowd has been minimalized whoever directed this did a fantastic job , you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there \( glass , sounds great \) this is the best concert dvd out right no
i have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie most comments are so ridiculous , that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good well i hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others the movie was full packed with action the 2 t rex's attacking the man in the car , is just one of the many great scenes , the stegosaurus attack , was so good , the raptors scenes kept me attached to my seat , scenes on the cliff were so good , dinosours loosed all over the island was very intense t rex on the san diego , one of the favorite sequences for many people my favorite sequences were on the island though the movie is intense and full of action excellent sequel if not better maybe some people have not noticed but on this page you can find that the movie was a total success on the whole world whether you like it or not , it made 614 millions world wide on the other side , the movie was nominate for
hello vietnam , and greetings ! , says bruno kirby as lt steven hauk in one scene of this film it was this scene where he filled in for radio personality adrian cronauer \( robin williams \) who was on reportedly on special assignment adrian arrives in vietnam from america via aircraft at first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the vietnam radio airwaves but they discover that adrian 's brand of humor is outrageous , very much like howard stern in real life they also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing hey , this was \( set in \) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with the beatles and the rolling stones from the united kingdom when adrian and lt hauk first met , the lieutenant told adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself when the lieutenant first heard adrian on the air , the lieutenant was not pleased at all with adrian 's stint you oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music' , not wild stuff , lt hauk told adrian in a meeting the 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like andy williams , perry como , mantovani , jim nabors , lawrence welk , frank sinatra and percy faith would bob dylan be out of line \? , adrian asks lt hauk and the lieutenant replies , way , way , way out of line ! adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in vietnam and they hoped that adrian would permanently do his morning show there the brass decides to suspend adrian , bringing heartbreak to fans when lt hauk did his stint , many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted adrian back on the air one listener said in a letter , captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man 's balls another wrote to lt hauk , you suck , eat a bag of s t ! so adrian is back on the air but not for long because sgt dickerson \( the late j t walsh \) , the top man of the brass , demanded that adrian be cancelled sgt dickerson 's superior loves adrian and even demanded his reinstatement sgt dickerson is transferred to guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant 's abusive attitude the title of this film is how adrian began his morning show on the very last show done by adrian 's friend lt ed garlick \( forrest whittaker \) , ed began the show saying , good morning , vietnam , just like adrian ed tells listeners about adrian 's departure from vietnam we hear adrian saying , goodbye , vietnam in a pre recorded message adrian also left vietnam because of his association with a criminal who 's the brother of a vietnamese woman adrian befriended other funny scenes include adrian teaching the vietnamese how to use profanity , adrian doing a parody of the late richard m nixon on the air and adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield this film was a megahit for both williams and director barry levinson they were both at least nominated for academy awards levinson did win a best director oscar for his next film , rain man this film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like three men and a baby both films were made by touchstone pictures , a division of buena vista pictures three men and a baby was a megahit as well both films were still in theatres by spring 1988 three men and a baby inspired a sequel , why did n't gmv \? obviously nobody had any ideas , not even mitch markowitz who composed the screenplay
i remember seeing this film when i was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling i did n't know what the name of this movie was and i was looking for it in the video stores i stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that i saw 20 years ago , i bought it after seeing it again , this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago though , by today 's standards , this movie is rather cheap and cheesy , it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling this movie is original , having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings , that eats people like birds eat worms this movie is a hybrid of godzilla and slasher flicks this is definately b movie material , but it 's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories and that is worth more than the price of admission
i bought this for my husband , because i knew he liked seven samurai he was delighted with the gift , and i was surprised to find that i really like these movies too they are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch
the greatest show ever to hit t v you will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great , it always keeps you guessing and wanting more c t u \( counter terrorist unit \) and c t u operative jack bauer \( keifer sutherland \) try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time what i like about this show is that keifer sutherlands character jack bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against c t u or the president another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show , so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more you still reading , stop and go buy the first season right now hell , buy all 4 right now thats how good it is
what a splendid teacher is this ! a soothing , captivating movie the students are most endearing
i really bought this dvd on a whim there is no question why this production won an emmy one voice the very last song in the concert is worth the price of dvd seriously stunning
if you love manilow , you will enjoy this dvd of a great entertainer all the old hits plus many new ones this dvd is almost like being there
tim burton 's ed wood , a surreal bio pic is one of the most entertaining , inspiring , and funny bio pics i 've seen no wonder really since it 's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio pic writers scott alexander larry karaszewski \( who , after this film , would pen the larry flynt bio pic the people vs larry flynt and the andy kaufman bio pic man on the moon \) it 's also got an amazing cast of actors , including oscar nominee johnny depp \( best actor , 'finding neverland' \) , oscar winner martin landau \( best supporting actor , 'ed wood' \) , sarah jessica parker \( 'failure to launch' \) , patricia arquette \( 'true romance' \) , jeffrey jones \( 'deadwood' \) , and oscar nominee bill murray
what can i say the humbler kinda says it all just watch him play
this movie sounded stupid when i first heard about it who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense \? obviously , ice cube could this movie stars lisaraye in her film debut as diana , who is known to the stripping world as diamond , a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school while working at a shoe store , she meets trixie \( adele givens \) and ronnie \( chrystale wilson \) they convince her into quitting her low paying job and working at the player 's club , a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named dollar bill \( bernie mac \) when diana 's cousin ebony \( monica calhoun \) comes into town , she tells diana that she wants to work at the player 's club ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of using what you 've got to get what you want this movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie featured in the movie are jamix foxx , a j johnson , and john amos the plot is perfect and the script is well written this movie has to be one of my favorite
i do n't think so , be it in the jungle , a new york high rise or at sea hepburn tracy were great , no argument but they were so modern urbane , not rowdy sexy , always fighting like harlow gable china seas is a fine example of this chemistry yeah , its a pretty good story too gable is capt gaskell , skipper of a passenger merchant ship running from hong kong to singapore harlow is the floozie , dolly , he had a fling with on shore the ship is carrying gold there is a terrific typhoon , a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while they torture the captain , but he does n't reveal where the gold is dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman , wallace berry , against the captain because she is mad at him she of course changes her mind the captain is trying to ditch dolly thinks he 's meant for lady sybil , played by rosalind russell , an old flame but he dolly really are in love unfortunately the collaborations between harlow gable was cut short at five movies with harlow untimely early death several years later
let me clear this up if you are a true exercise fanatic , this dvd is for you i 've done every dvd exercise program including taebo and this ranks in my top 2 taebo is awesome for the cardio but when it comes down to muscle tone , this dvd is tops the background music and background exercise people are the least of my worries , you have to concentrate on the exercises she does to tone your body ! ! ! these exercises are an all over workout my favorite part is the 20 minute arm workout , my arms never looked so good ! ! she works the hell out of you and it took me a few times to get through it but if you want to tone up and get in shape , just put in this dvd and be prepared to sweat ! ! !
cameron crowe , rene zelleweger , cuba gooding and tom cruise were all at the top of their game the superlative fluidity and cinematic thrill of this successful feature was facilitated by experienced actors in sync , and guaranteed by superb production and studio crafts a timeless classic in a class of its own
oh my god this has to be the best film i have ever seen in my life first things first , how did they train that monkey , he is as clever as einstein my pal mickso said its just a guy in a suit but that son of a gun is n't fooling me clap ! clap ! clap ! well done mr monkey ! anyways i 'd highly recommend this film and joining a stamp collecting club , they 've both changed my life forever , in fact i hope to grow up to be a stamp collecting monkey actor with as many casio watches as i can eat this is kevin kennedy signing out dudes o
i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister , over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head , or when she accidently dyed her hair green , or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie , with gorgeous scenery , unforgettable characters , and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
it 's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was 3 , and it was played on cartoon network , they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they do n't play it anymore , i 've bought seasons 1 and 2 i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse
marc singer is a bloke from england who moved to new york city , saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets , and became friends with them they in turn trusted him , accepted him as one of their own , and showed him their secret living quarters deep underground in abandoned train tunnels , the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets intelligent and resourceful , they had hooked up to free electricity and had working tv 's and stoves
another reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film i 'll second that opinion
this comedy starring \( martin short \) , and \( kurt russell \) is pretty funny when i first watched it , i was n't really impressed with it , but now i find it pretty funny i think that \( kurt russell \) , as captain ron was pretty funny however , it was the antics of \( martin short \) , who hires captain ron to sail his ship in the caribbean , that was the funniest character in the film the story begins when a relative of \( short \) dies , leaving him a ship , which is moored at a small caribbean island the wife \( mary kay place \) who is not too pleased at going to the island , decides to go along with this mid life crises of \( short \) on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat
judy garland , marlena deitrich , shirley bassey , and marilyn monroe are l v 's \( short for little voice \) best friends in the world ! on 33 1 3 lp 's , that is !
is it a bad thing to see a movie and deem it good by standards different from which you would judge other movies \? let me explain
for every season , there is a classic movie in our house , a christmas story tops the list when christmas rolls around without a doubt this movie is a classic ! ralphie and his quest for the red ryder bb gun i do love this movie
awesome college movie my only regret is that i did not see this movie during my college years alas , they have the dvd now !
based on the early movie cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters , george lucas created something special a re invention of the entire adventure genre these films waited a long time to make their bow on dvd , much too long for myself , personally i always loved these films , they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time each of the three films is very different from the others raiders of the lost ark , the first and best of the three , introduces us to indiana jones , perhaps lucas 's greatest creation premiering in 1981 , this film was a smash , also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture also starring was karen allen , perhaps the most even matched female co star for harrisan ford it seemed she could give as good she got , and never backed down in any scene second was the temple of doom , easily the darkest of the three , and the most intensely exciting this film is a non stop thrill ride from start to finish , and does n't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor the third film , the last crusade , is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor , and has the wonderful sean connery to steal every scene he 's in the interaction between indy and mr jones is wonderful if anyone was to ever play indiana jones' father , it was sean connery the forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features , which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves these films waited far too long to be released to dvd , and i lay the blame squarely on george lucas i 've heard he really did n't think dvd would take off like it did , that it was just a phase it 's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy as with his star wars trilogy , the indiana jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all dvd collections
i saw this on pbs' great performances this documentary is about film genius akira kurosawa the documentary charts akira kurosawa 's early life in pre wwii japan to the end of his life kurosawa brought japanese cinema to a world wide audience i recommend this dvd for anyone who is a akira kurosawa fan plus the dvd has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the pbs program and kurosawa filmography
dietrich bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey his books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues , but practical issues of the greatest moment there is a great line in kierkegaard , in the preface to the sickness unto death , where he writes everything essentially christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed even if only medical experts understand it , it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person what gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them , as he struggled to live out the implications of christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so
bonhoeffer was a very informative , very interesting video i first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor i watched the portion that pbs showed , and i wanted to see more , so i bought the dvd i am glad that i did
love this dvd i loved the live performance at the mtv awards
on hearing that warner bros was to issue a set of busby berkeley films , i ensured my dvd player was rendered region free and then i waited it was a dream finally come true having been entranced by berkeley 's films since childhood i could hardly wait for the box to arrive oh joy ! the quality of the dvds is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed , if some of these extras are not to one 's taste , then fair enough , but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature
this is a great video collection of her past videos i love it from the sweet 'i wanna love you forever' to the record label controlled image of 'irrisistible' and 'a little bit' i love the 'a little bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop but overall this dvd is awesome i like the footage from the dream chaser tour and the biography stuff this is the best dvd before jennifer lopez 's the reel me
look at my review for the movie soundtrack i had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie , but my mom sold it i hate that fact , but there is n't a thing i can do about it i wish i could get one back
this is the kind of movie i used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see , oh , about once every 10 years or so an incredibly interesting , odd , provocative movie , that does n't insult its audience the acting is phenomenal , the script is really interesting , and the characters are not people you 've seen 1000 times before although it 's sort of about baseball , it 's not a baseball movie it 's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this i loved this movie
videodriome is a movie i 've been a fan of for years i use the movie as a test to see if people are real movie and horror fans and not just posers the best part of the film is that any day now fox will greenlight a reality tv show where twenty somethings are killed in front of a live studio audience if you 're new to the work of david croneburg check this out asap and see what all the fuss is about the criterion dvd is stacked with extras and the transfer is a thing of beauty
yes , i thought the whoppi disclaimers were absurd \( how many generations have grown up with these cartoons , and now all of a sudden they 're bad \? \) i never saw disclaimers on cbs when i watched these cartoons on saturday mornings for years and years ! ! !
i grew up in hannibal mo , so i am very familiar with mark twain 's writing and his humor the make up is great as holbrook even looks like twain holbrook is a great story teller , and he uses the material well , and makes it wa wonderful program i saw a perfomance live in nyc years ago , and another one in my current home town each time i see it again , it is still funny and a great performance
visconti 's film is significantly different from mann 's classic story aside from the obvious changes \( aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer , etc \) , there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character for example in the book , aschenbach 's wife is dead , and his daughter is grown up and married away in the film , his daughter dies in childhood , and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits venice
i first viewed this film with a friend , in my home he and i are both lovers of beautiful music and art this film satisfies both categories the score is absolutely magnificent and the views of venice , beautiful the acting \( by main character dirk bogard \) is subtle but effective we found this film to be a totally soul satisfying experience
excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an f b i
liam neeson was wonderful to watch a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots however , patricia arquette was too teenage giggly not a terrific actress in this film , at least still , a great role for neeson
one of the best movies i 've seen in ages ! ! ! most movies put me to sleep , i stayed awake the entire time action , suspense , great flick !
upon watching the movie sick , i came to an all out conclusion of all other movies i had seen in the past they will never compare to bob flanagans true life experience of living beyond the expected life span of a human with cf this man truly took his illness by the balls and showed the viewer that pain can be an issue that is manipulated in an entirely different way i found it very interesting how bob chose to be a slave to the woman he loves rather than a slave to his miserable disease those who dare watch as bob experiences life through the vice of pain those with weak stomaches , beware
great plot ! a crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs a good hearted man named dave who thinks about others , and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while two of the presidents regular staff try to get dave to do things that is contrary to dave 's character so the story goes on from there who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the white house this dvd picture was good and clear , the sound was great , and the case was in excellent condition if you like warm hearted type movies , then this is the one for you i know i have enjoyed it over and over to me , dave is about character , good or bad , and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us
i was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses but then i saw the ending , and it was a beautiful one it always makes me happy to see love onscreen
my review of the village mentions the sixth sense more than it does the village , so here it is
i have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2 i ordered seasons 1 2 and they love it every night we turn daniel boone on before bedtime and we do n't have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show i hope they put out the next 4 seasons
i thought this was a wonderful dvd because of the following factors
denzel washington plays the legendary steve biko in this late 80 's film , while kevin kline plays a top journalist who befriends washington 's character in south africa denzel is my favorite actor , and although he does n't get a lot of screen time , this is one of his strongest roles ever \( and you know that 's saying a lot \) not only does he nail down the african accent , but he portray 's biko 's renown concern and persistence
i have heard both arrau and richter playing liszt 's b minor sonata and i am afraid i very much prefer the way yundi li had played this piece perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as arrau 's technique was always not that impressive
li is no heavy weight pianist neither is bunin or even zimerman and do n't foeget that chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all and judging from the steam and progess li has made , lang lang 's position is certainly under threat and any viewer who is interested in li or how chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this here we have to thank martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the chopin competition now in his mid twenties , and musically out of almost nowhere , li is already a full fledged musician
i thought beavis and butthead changed america their stupidity was a influence of a generation i , sadly , was not allowed to watch the show when it was on tv \( i was a child and in my elementary school years at the time \) , and because i actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode \( just like the duo themselves , they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and i do n't care for music videos \) , i really love the show however , like other people who also liked the show , i have to agree with them to release all of the episodes \( for goodness sake ! i ca n't believe they did n't put in the customers suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one i have ever seen when the show was on tv \) because we want to see and have all of the episodes , not just 80 of them and never get to see the other ones i guess this is still recommended but remember , we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back \( even if they have a lost episodes collection i do n't care , the people want them and mike judge is refusing to give us them !
this amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability the combination of puppets and live action works really well , david bowie is wonderful , and , all in all , it 's a great family film when i gave it to my two granddaughters , ages 8 and 4 , they watched it wide eyed and a little bit scared but then they watched it at least once a day for the next week
the professional reviewer missed the main point of jeffrey 's dilemma he 's not so afraid of getting aids he 's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it most people figure a 50 chance of dying before their spouse but taking on a person with a known , fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate , poignant situation
this movie was alright i give it five stars for being artsy , quirky
this dvd was more challenging than i thought , but within a few short weeks i can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different , so i guess that means the programs really work haha \) overall i have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available i easily recommend this dvd
i truly love this film and it 's one of my top favorite film of all time the cinematography is absolutely beautiful if you enjoy violence , beauitful scenery of brazil , a great gang drug related story this film is absolutely brillant
i first bought the dvd for my mother for christmas she let me borrow it i am glad that i finally watched it it is a truly great movie it is a funny movie and very entertaining i suggest either renting it or buying it
i really enjoyed this movie rose mcgowan did a great job as the villianess debbie my favorite line from the movie it 's a family thing the movie was , in my opinion , a black comedy and rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school brilliant ! you should definately watch this movie when you have n't got anything better to do
ever wonder where col kurtz would 've ended up if he had survived the end of apocalypse now \? well , now we know he exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals the horror , the horror
i bought this dvd because it was listed as an imax title , but it is also 3d if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer \( regular 3d glasses dont work with this title \) the quality of the graphics are terrific , the plot is a little strange , but basically its aliens who invade and ride 4 virtual roller coasters at a futuristic theme park the rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique my kids love this dvd , and its worth the price !
casts were chosen by the author hemingway himself that short comment on this film opening was really the miracle particularly gary cooper as american dynamiter roberto and ingrid bergman as hapless young girl maria could happen only through the number of miracles
i never bought the vhs tape , but when i was notified this would be coming out on dvd , i ordered it while i'm not an amateur , i am a professional , eric is a guitarist 's guitarist anyone who thinks he do n't need learnin' is a fool and only famous in his own little world , small as it may be i'm not that arrogant
sea of love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller , but it did n't really bowl me over pacino 's very good , of course , and ellen barkin more than holds her own against him , but pacino 's character can become tiresome after a while , and what i regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic i'm not saying the mystery is predictable it 's just not that shocking of a surprise
film noir at it 's best lies , betrayal , deception , sexual eroticism all through the movie you dont know who to cheer for , the cop , the dirty teacher , the trailer trash chic , the funny lawyer , the school tramp , the tramp 's mother , the cop 's partner , the tramp 's mother cuban lover you dont know who is who and what is up or down one big dirty camp of a movie to describe it with only one word it would be yummy
there are so many reasons to like wild things it 's easy to call this movie perfect although it 's not the best movie ever made \( or even in the top 20 for that matter \) it truly is a perfect movie for what it could 've been i borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it , it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity well , this movie does have a plot and it 's quite complicated some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes , but you ca n't argue that this is a damned good movie matt dillon stars as sam lombardo , a guidance counselor at blue bay high school lombardo is a lady 's man , in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he 's done half of blue bay well , lombardo has a student named kelly van ryan \( denise richards , who i 've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie \) who seems to be coming onto him lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in blue bay well , one day kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash lombardo 's car for the senior car wash and then we see kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face then , kelly says lombardo raped her lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer \( bill murray \) well , then another girl named suzie toller \( neve campbell \) says lombardo raped her as well another player in the plot is ray duquette \( kevin bacon \) , the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories now , this movie is one of those films where you think you know what 's going on and then they throw a wild card after that , you think you know what 's going on again and then s it happens even when the movie ends , you do n't know the full story until the credit sequence the sex scenes \( the most famous with denise richards , matt dillon , and neve campebell \) are quite nice , but surprisingly the movie would be good without them this is a really great movie and worth the 5 bucks it would cost to buy it
first off i agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie when denise richards sees matt dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like , is this just a game for the boys , or can anyone play \? she looks so sweet and hot that it 's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later however she pulls ift off pretty well in fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well i could n't understand why kevin bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual , but that was actually pretty good acting i ca n't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists , but it 's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing
this movie looks simply amazing ! the color , texture and detail provided by hd dvd are superb , this is a showcase title for the format first a word about my setup , which is nice but far from optimal the hd dvd player is connected via hdmi to a sanyo pl z4 projector , with an approximately 140 picture thrown onto a light beige wall the room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado 's but my family and i thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it
an extraordinary film , the vanishing , brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest
a great reality show , following a group of working class youths in england getting the chance to become cooks in a top uk restaurant for free it 's highly entertaining and well worth the price we caught this show when we were visiting australia and got hooked also check out jamie 's school dinners series , available on amazon uk
i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well i think the remake is incredible is it better than the original \? in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie now if he can pull that off \)
the premier american cinematic drama is the western , and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns this set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot , every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side there are n't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections
the first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of usmc boot camp i have ever seen , outside of actually being there i 've read that r lee emery , who played the senior drill instructor , was initially hired to coach other actors for the role but he did such a perfect job himself that stanley kubrick hired him for the job if the film had ended after the first half alone , it would have been phenomenal
i enjoyed the movie very much since i love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as merrick says when men still had honor , i wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime besides i'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs , even if it mea n't changing history i liked that they portayed lady clair as a tough , stand up to the bad guy , do what needed to be done , spy for her brother to win the battle , kinda lady
this is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s it 's an updated version on an old theme save the young heroine from the evil , blood sucking vampire
this dvd kick starts the longest running animated prime time show ever the first season was an experiement to the show there are many solid episodes in this 13 episode season like bart the general , call of the simpsons , krusty gets busted and some enchanted evening
this is one of my favorite movies of all time having it on dvd so i can select a scene just makes it better the only complaint i have is that there are no subtitles available \( at far as i can tell \) otherwise it 's great a faithful rendition of a classic story i think jane austen would be pleased
see how the creative process works when making the world 's best selling album ever great insight on the a band coming together as one interviews are great
ok , i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo
three stooges meet waiting for godot lurie , waits and benigni turn in great performances they 've been locked up in a lousiana penitentiary for being in the wrong place at the wrong time jarmusch gives you each of their sordid lives in turn before throwing them together in a jail cell benigni plays wonderfully off lurie and waits , culminating in a hilarious version of i scream , you scream , we all scream for ice scream eventually , they find the light at the end of a tunnel , only to have to escape through a swamp jarmusch gives his characters plenty of room , making for many amusing interchanges jarmusch provides deft camera work and his usual wonderful eye for detail to make this his most memorable film
okay , how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants \? unless you were one of the misery causing bee otches , you did n't this movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena , but takes a good crackshot at the mothers \( kirstie alley 's character is a real gem ! \) it also makes fun of the people in minnesota i see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film , but heard the term midwest used far more often we feel your pain , but i would have laughed had they picked my state \( which is very close to mn \) they poke fun at hunters , lutherans \( yes , i'm one \) , and lutefisk for lunch in high school \( i'm also of norwegian decent \)
art history has always been an interest of mine , and i'm a big fan of other art movies such as girl with a pearl earing and merchant of venice so when i found out about modigliani i was happy to take the time to go watch it not only was it worth my time , but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion was n't looked fondly on
i have both madonna grimes workouts dvd 's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts it was a great way to start my day , i was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same , but with disapointment comes satisfaction the other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts , and learn a workout that i never thought that i would learn and enjoy doing jayna 's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning , also great moves you can use for other reasons rania 's upper body is really fun , some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot suhaila workout i am intimidated by i have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it i have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks she can contract them one at a time some mornings i get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape they are really fun this tape has a bonus yoga , i had never tried yoga and this gave me an opportunity to try it
wm 2000 had 2 great matches witch were the trangle ladder match and the fatal 4 way match for the wwe championship wm 17s best matches were chris benoit vs kurt angle , vince mchmahn vs shane mchmahn in a street fight , the tlc match , undertaker vs hhh , and the main event the rock vs stone cold for the wwe championship match of the night for wm 18 was the rock vs hulk hogan wm 19 had 4 great matches and they were shawn michels vs chris jherico , hulk hogan vs vince mchmahn in a street fight , the rock vs stone cold , and brock lesner vs kurt angle for the wwe championship and wm 20s best matches were eddie guerro vs kurt angle and chris benoit vs shawn michels vs hhh buy this ! ! !
i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times , almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before
the movie was great ! ! but they left a few things out in the movie that were in the book ! ! there were more siblings in the book but this is still a must see and must read !
love the book could n't wait for the movie and was not disappointed ! i have watched it many times , and enjoy it each time the story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event , which is why it took two dvds or 3 cds \( yes i have both \) to show the entire story a great way to spend a cold , winter day
this is one of the best photography documentary i have ever seen i love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets i love the story narration that this dvd succeeds in james nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal you can feel the pain , agony and raw human emotion in his photographs he is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger it needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed
the seventh season was the season that got me hooked to south park specifically episode number 712 all about the mormons that was the first episode that got me into the show , and i have n't stopped watching since the season list includes the following
absolutely brilliant ! if you are a south park fan , this has got to be added to your collection matt and trey have lost none of their wit and i ca n't wait until the eigth season is released ! i had to purchase it from the usa \( i live in england \) as it 's not yet available over here and it actually cost less to buy and have it shipped over than it was to buy the previous six seasons in the shops
i really enjoyed this dvd it was sent through the postal system in very guickly thanks
if your not already hooked on the story of these interns you have some catching up to do its not your typical medical drama and certainly worth watching
movie was pretty good coming of life story about a boy from jersey trying to make it as a bartender in the hottest club in the city addresses teen issues such as , drug abuse , sex , betrayal , jealously and family
i owned this movie in full screen on vhs the quality of the transfer of apollo 13 with the wide screen and the incredible clearity 0f hd that was never possible before , makes this movie a true cinematic experience one of tom hanks' best movies !
great movie ! make it part of your collection good story , beautiful video and great sound turn your volume up on the blast off and you will feel the power !
this movie is a real departure for the director , akira kurosawa , in that it blends his humanistic inspirational type movies , like ikiru with a bit of action and drama yojimbo , sanjuro the majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of japan under a domineering senior doctor naturally , everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour midway through the movie , out of nowhere , one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission it is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief , confusing , and brutal toshiro mifune and kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director 's work changed radically still good , but i 'll always prefer the b w epics the two of them made together
ahh remincing about the old days of youth this dvd is great for the young and the old w comedy that surpasses all generation its a great gift
i bought this only because i loved the first one , hoping it was n't as terrible as the second after i watched it i was so impressed first of all i loved that it really did n't have anything to do with the first , aside from cassidy being katherine 's cousin , and sharing the same last name \( there is only one reference to katherine and sebastian in the beginning \) it is much better than having different actors playing old characters , which drags a movie down alot i thought the story was great , with good twists the whole cast is very attractive , which ca n't hurt either the bad characters are all pretty likeable , aside from one , and all is well in the end the best thing about this movie is the character cassidy i sarted out hating her , and ended up really liking her for her realness , and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b tch this actress does a particularly good job , pulling off both loveable , and complete brat at the same time i would definetly reccomend this movie
goal ! is a well done soccer version of the road to glory in athletics it is a true cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom
i ca n't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars i do n't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews , but this is certainly not a bad movie i was in 7th grade when it came out and i remember how popular it was back then everyone , and i mean everyone loved it no one said they did n't like it even my dad to this day says he would n't mind watching the movie a few more times , and he never wants to watch a movie more than two times
this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out an excellent and energetic movie from the start plot is cutesy it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences however , i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes \? i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me
now , this is a rock n' roll show from rock 's good guys pearl jam is probably the most important band ever in american music they are to the us what led zeppelin was to britain this concert is a fantastic representation of their mature post millenium shows no , you wo n't see a lot of crowd surfing or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings , just a lot of great music , and wonderful lyrics mike mccready is quite possibly one of the world 's most underrated , soulful guitarists , and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing at first , i was not a fan of adding boom gaspar to the shows , but i have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band , as i do matt cameron , who filled in a revolving throne back when jack irons left due to back problems after yield
wonderful show , fun episodes , great actors dvd boxset comes with confidentials with behind the scene footage however , the confidentials are shortened versions from the full confidentials shown on television but only footage of the old series of doctor who was removed
what can i say , on a scale of 1 thru 10 this movie goes to 11 !
most people does n't realize that this band suck's ! ! ! !
this is a fascinating look at the journey through the first 5 books of the bible it 's a visual foundation for stories that all three major religions , the jews , the christians and the muslims , hold sacred to their faith and their traditions as a documentary , the journey takes place today in the midst of the modern day struggles and misunderstandings that make it realistic and thought provoking for our faith today
i love sandra bullock movies in this movie she is so innocent and falls in love with a man she has never spoken to but saves his life on the cta in the time that he is still in a coma his family , thinking she is their son 's fiancee , fall in love with her she inadvertantly falls in love with his brother i jus love the cinderella story line she is fantastic as well as the family and especially bill pullman
while roman polanski was avoiding authories in america in 1988 , he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller it stars harrison ford in a rather unique role that of a doctor , an every man type such as jimmy stewart in the man who knew too much without the indiana jones hype although filmed 18 years ago , it seems more contemporary that ever a fine thriller that even hitch would approve !
nice movie with a resonable story and a keeper for anyone looking to add in his collection great nude scenes with angelina jolie
this is a great documentary alex jones is not a nut , just very passionate about the quality \( or lack \) of our governments
the replicant proves that van damme can really act he again portrays two people as in double impact he is both a villan and his dna duplicate hence replicant van damme displays a great range of emotions as the replicant like a child discovering the world as the villan he 's truly psycho the feds make the replicant of this serial killer called the torch in hopes of learning how to catch him the story line will keep you watching , in suspense and guessing do n't look for all of the usual martial arts scenes here
everyone should see this movie it does not matter if your gay or straight
after much debate , i decided to view this film with an open mind the performances are outstanding i really liked the music composition , as it flowed gently with the story in a way , i'm glad this film didnt't win best picture for one reason the on location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch maybe its too perfect later on , we find out it 's not wyoming , but it alberta , canada take a star away ! overall , this is a movie that will advance gay right in the united states for those who do n't like it , the train has left the station !
astonishing you have to see it to believe just turn off the lights , seat back and have fun and amazon delivery is realy great
this is one of my favourite christmas movies along the lines of it 's a wonderful life modern style cage is perfect in this role surprisingly ! tea leone is a great supporting actress and the little girl is adorable all around a wonderful movie some mature content though so not for the younger viewers \( robbery and sexual nature in parts \)
the documentary was really , really good they left some stuff out of it , of course , but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense one thing i did not remember was the prodigious mullet brian sported back in the day man , i think that thing was more impressive than jagr 's cup winning mullet of the early 90s !
thank you wwe vince for making another great dvd box set and also stone cold i got it this morning and popped this bad boy in and love it a must buy if your a old school wrestling fan or a new one i do n't regret buying this at al
i'm new to the world of pilates and this dvd is very helpful the instructor explains everything clearly so that you can be sure of doing each pose correctly the great thing about this dvd is that now that i'm getting comfortable with pilates , i can continue using this video because it lets you chose workouts for beginners , intermediates , and advanced there 's no need to buy any additional dvds ! and days that i do n't have time to fit in a whole workout , it also gives you time ranges to choose from this video is worth buying for those wanting to try pilates i 've recommended it to my friends , and they all use it now
a movie not geared for morons ! what a rare find there are n't many movies that ca n't be figured out half way through this film is great very clever never saw the ending coming
skillful direction , screenplay , camera angles , acting \) i could n't understand benicio del toro 's mumbling it turns out he did that on purpose , as he said in the special features
a family oriented film that is humorous , fun , exciting and very entertaining ! after seeing this movie for the first time , i had to own it ! it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean this is a must own for the family
this movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres ! i think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts , which is when vivian tells edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best friend roommate and runs into her pimp boyfriend carlos the extras are fabulous and could n't be better so pick up a copy of this movie toda
pretty woman \( 15th anniversary special edition \) has to be considered one of the most classical , romantic comedies made throughout the years julia roberts and richard gere are excellent actors together and without them i do n't believe the movie would have been the same this classic fairy tale movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest this is not your typical romantic movie and i believe that is why so many people love this movie pretty woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there
armageddon
i never thought yoga could be so easy and beneficial
wow this a great series have to strongly recommend it yep has the feel of sienfeld with over the top humor clever , awkward , somewhat vulgar
over the years , people have grown tired of natural disaster movies why \? because they all appear to be the same here 's an example of a typical storyline everything starts out nice and calm , the story focuses on one family , the family starts having problems and they split up , and then a volcano , tornado , hurricane , or whatever hits , and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger just so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie
personally , i really enjoyed premonition it 's got solid acting , a fascinating \( and often heart wrenching \) story , and some decent scares however , do n't expect an all out fright fest or you 'll be sorely disappointed this is a story driven film , with a plot that progresses fairly slowly patience is necessary when viewing premonition , as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and dream like logic in a film but for those of you who possess those qualities , and are looking for something a little different \( particularly if you 're a fan of the genre \) , premonition might be for you
this movie is fantastic ! it is defo on my fav list one of the best !
setting theme \( s \) castlerock , smallville , summer friends' adventure , life 's lessons , solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown
i'm a colin firth fan , but that 's not the only reason this movie was a great ride it 's because it is a great ride just enjoy you will find yourself in stitches the contrast between new england dry humor and brit dry humor it 's just too funny oliver , colin you guys are the best ! ! !

half light is a movie my wife would like , if i can convince her that it 's not too scary for her she is the most timid of movie goers , and refuses to watch horror movies with me but half light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense there are some scares , but at the most tepid edge of today 's horror the movie is much more about the grief of a mother \( have the kleenex box close by \) , and has a big love story \( with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse ugh \) in the middle of it just the kind of thing my wife might like , when she 's willing to see something on her scary side unfortunately for me , this is not my kind of movie at all
the third installment of our favorite wizard has him meeting a new defense of the dark arts teacher along with some rather scary gatekeepers as the magical world hunts for sirius black harry 's godfather who has escaped from the dreaded azkaban prison meanwhile hermione discovers a way to time travel with a special locket and take more classes it is definitley getting darker and darker but this third in a series sets the tone for harry 's destiny
just like it used to be my son has enjoy every minute of i
these movies are just as great as i remembered them
csi miami , having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons , reaches its high point in season 3 anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio , unlike gil grissom or mac taylor , is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining , but the show is truly about him this dynamic , when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul , make this for me the csi that is above the rest
this dvd has footage i had never seen before on tv it has some of the best footage of the second plane hitting the towers it not only covers the new york disaster but also the penatgon and pennsylvania plus the war in iraq
hey richie , get a life
what 's not to like about the character of jack ryan \? he 's honest , ethical , modest , smart and rising like a shooting star in the us government wish he was real
great video , it will be a classic in the coming years as these entertainers are dying at a fast rate they are still as good as they were in the old days considering their age
dustin hoffman , arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s , is in top form here but this time as a woman sure , there have been other films with similar setups victor victoria with julie andrews and mrs doubtfire with robin williams , to name just two andrews , however , is n't believable as a man , and while williams is exceptional in doubtfire , that movie seems to lose its edge near the end in tootsie , jessica lange , teri garr , and dabney coleman all provide laudable even outstanding performances lange won an oscar for best supporting actress , and garr was nominated in that category dustin hoffman was nominated for best actor , sidney pollack for best director , and the film for best picture why did n't it win any of those three \? one word gandhi nevertheless , tootsie looks as though it were fun to make , and it is certainly fun to watch this is an absolute must for dustin hoffman fans

rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence , teenage angst , sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon 's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality in his screen debut , chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon , and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she can carry out his divine plan campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to , while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings \( especially his large penis \) and telling god he knows the best candidate will win
the film shows us the reality that is wal mart , many common criticisms , and many common misconceptions it successfully shows that all of the criticisms against wal mart are outright lies , half truths , distortions of facts , or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business it shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job it also shows how wal mart has actually increased america 's standard of living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least skilled amongst us able to attain high quality health benefits and a decent wage
on december 14 , 1944 , as american troops under general douglas macarthur slowly advanced toward the island of luzon , japanese guards at the puerto princesa prison camp on palawan committed a terrible act herding their allied war prisoners into trenches , they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive
ok , so it may not be in the 5 star league , but it 's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting my scouts think it 's too funny
a short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape !
cinderella ii dreams come true is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original cinderella and a few new ones the animation is amazing it 's filled with lush color \( except for muted color when the story calls for it \) and the animation looks very polished it 's really a sight to see
i bought this set a couple of weeks ago and just finished getting through it it is well worth the money you wo n't be sorry you bought it funny as it gets
where did this guy come from \? my daughter rented this eddie izzard dvd i was blind sided with the sophisticated , mime style humor of eddie izzard \( is this his real name \? is he really a he \? \) from hearing about genesis to wondering why noah had to get two of everything including ducks , eddie izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy nothing was off limits the queen mother , death , hopscotch , speed archeology , toasters , and achilles it is all here !
i was totally taken with this new rendition of the broadway musical the only downside is that i'm not much of an alec baldwin fan , but he did ok ! i encourage anyone who enjoys a heartwarming musical to see this one
what i enjoy most about this movie , is not what i particularly enjoyed when it first came out being 11 when it came out , i was attracted to the urbanism of which i was not too familiar with i did n't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood , but it was no inglewood either i think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film the urban youth seeing for the first time , thier lives on a film of this caliber , and the suburban youth somehow glorifying this life while i still enjoy the entire film , what i particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film the story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders , ca n't be tamed by her she sends him to live with his father , who is in many ways her equal but he is a man and one of her lines in the movie is i ca n't teach him how to be a man , that 's your job how true this is not to sound sexist , because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother , \( because of an abusive father , etc \) but you need a man to teach you to be a man larry fishburne 's charachter in this movie does this perfectly one quote , i know you think i'm being hard on you tre , but i'm not what i'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility your friends across the street do n't have anyone to do that , your'e gonna see how they end up , too i loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents \( while divorced \) raise their son the way they know best , and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal i 'd have to say that my favorite character is furious yes , reva \( tre 's mom \) played an equally strong part , but i loved how real furious was young tre i thought played an excellent part better than gooding jr \? maybe overall a great movie it 's success made it harder for corporate america to ignore the reality of inner city youth as it exists today
a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation \( many called it a ripoff \) with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work \( and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes \)
dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is one third of the films that are considered stanley kubrick 's masterpieces \( the other two are 2001 a space odyssey a clockwork orange \) it 's a satire , released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today whenever you look at a list of great movies , it 's on there it holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 \( 26 \) ,
this black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all this is a not just a courtroom movie , but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other reginald rose 's original play reads like a powerhouse , even in a highschool english class , but given the direction of sidney lumet , the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film
i feel this movie should be seen by all it 's awesome , and really makes you think you get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling i highly recommend it ! awesome movie
it 's really refreshing to watch series such as bones it 's witty and suspenseful unlike law and order , this show has more well everything
i have n't watched the first season i just started watching the show so i'm a very brand new viewer but i 've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show its subject matter is grim , yes , but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry , especially david boreanaz \( buffy the vampire slayer , angel \) and emily deschanel the stories are interesting w out being too scientific so anyone can follow along and i never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone 's bones \( okay , maybe only in tv land \)
`sophie scholl die letzten tage' \( `sophie scholl the final days' \) follows the last six days of the life of sophie scholl , member of `the white rose' small anti nazi organization that protested against hitler through the non violence method in the war time munich her life had been filmed in germany twice before `the white rose' by michael verhoeven , and `the five last days' by percy adlon both in 1982 unfortunately i have n't seen them , but the fact proves that this anti war organization during the wwii in germany , some part of which still remain mystery , has been always a very fascinating topic in that country

we own three baby faith dvd 's our favorite is god made music , followed by god made me god made animals , while still a good video , is our least favorite for one , the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing \( but judge for yourself , i 've posted some pictures \) the frog was creepy since when do frogs have lips \? the visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too and the undersea clips at the end looked as old as cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year old son , who is entranced by the other two videos but does n't seem to care much for this one my suggestion watch before you buy , if you can if your kid likes it , go for it if not , try the other videos you may get a different reaction
i do n't care what people say , i got it right off the bat , what the movie was about i joy it as well alien predator kids , it worked just fine for me you got to love predator kicking butt those cool look aliens it 's fun watching i 'll enjoy , years to come calling spaceship earth thank for the trip thanks for dropping me at back home based more on comic books alien vs predator not so much on passed alien movies or predator movies
i'm not a big fan of tom or demi , and jack even wears out his welcome in some films , but not here the supporting roles are superbly done , the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end , and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a half hour or so here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict , and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years i enjoy the script , because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force
i have been a fan of csi since the first season has come out i am an avid collector of dvds and i'm way behind , i'm on another show right now as we speak anyway , i love the sound , and the special features are always low , but i do n't mind that there is just one thing that i did not like part of the cover case on my season four dvd , came off it still fits into my dvd collection , and i obviously wo n't buy another copy because the dvd 's are working fine , but the plastic may come into a problem
had this movie on vhs and my family wore it out ! an unexpected gem in the harry potter tradition
this was a wonderful story telling about the hard working italian immigrants that started their businesses in new york their determination , long hours , and love of family represent the values those immigrants brought to america
could n't believe that this was the same john lithgow who starred in third rock from the sun , an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on nbc john plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by denzel 's character
seeing hearing a movie such as this in the german language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic
i became interested in this movie after reading the book ishmael by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ishmael there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization takers are mentioned but it comes across more as you just do n't know what you are missing by being one not that all of nature has had it heck , the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees but of course that was the main point of ishmael if we do n't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature , then nature has had it and so have we
this is a good cold war drama after a soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place , the race is on to recapture the film as was pointed out in the film , the soviets used their german scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from england 's german scientists using a special film developed by the us 's german scientists the film has the location of both side 's missile installations and both sides want it neither side will give an inch
i had to replace my video with this dvd version this movie is spectacular beautiful photography , excellent acting , and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time it is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in europe artemesia , whose father is an artist , is forbidden to draw or paint the human body her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure especially when trying to get her into the male only art school he finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an unlawful relationship he files rape charges and everyone suffers a brilliant social commentary
before i saw this sequel , i had heard and read that it was a terrible film however , be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it 's not as good as the original it 's full of so much self deprecating humor that you ca n't help but cut it a break i laughed quite a few times , and there are a lot of fun moments
so i do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena i have watched them all , marcus welby right on through er scrubs is the most realistic , albiet tongue in cheek representation of our professions you cannot take everything seriously , but , if you believe an emergency room can function like er 24 7 and still have people standing , you 're out of touch w reality as well
this is a must have dvd , not only for wrasslin' fans , but for all of mankind you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well
this dvd is hilarious ultimate warrior was a pretty cool character but legally changing his name to the warrior that is downright weird christain is too funny in his impressionation
this was my first exercise ball tape i bought being a larger size person , i found that this was a help to getting started i can do most of the exercises right away i like that it has exercises with weights also i find this a help to getting back into shape , even with my bad back
lots of good exercises and lots of helpful hints good dvd ! would recommend it to friends
director richard donner \( ladyhawke , superman , lethal weapon i , ii , iii , iv , etc \) leads an ensemble cast of stars gerard butler , billy connolly , frances o'connor , ethan embry , morton csokas and david thewlis back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist ! \( yeah ! i wrote those words ! not another critic yet it 's a true analysis of this fantastic film ! \)
this bbc miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce \( here the source material is not just one work but several works of dh lawrence \) than most literary adaptations for english television also , while most bbc productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward thinking characters in this case the sultry and sophisticated , and somewhat libertine \( in a 1920 's kind of way \) , lady chatterly the earthy and irreverent and smoldering \( smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class \) oliver mellors both of these factors can be attributed to director ken russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the bbc 's best programs \( many of them about musical composers \) russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking of course most of us in the states know ken russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as tommy \( 1975 \) , altered states \( 1979 \) , and , gothic \( 1986 \) all of which feature lurid dream sequences and , some would say , gratuitously lewd situations but ken russell is actually a director with many facets , and russell 's interest in dh lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best dh lawrence adaptation on film , women in love \( starring glenda jackson , oliver reed alan bates \) he then followed that up twenties years later with the rainbow \( starring amanda donohoe , and sammie davis \) both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books his additions , however , were tasteful and even added clarity to the material
sure , i could have compared phantom quest corp to a lot of other animes out there , but the basic premise is the same we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci fi mysteries and there is definitely nothing wrong with that
to be honest , i think i found this by looking at listmania lists when i was searching for other anime titles i had never heard of it , but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so i decided to give it a shot , although i did n't really expect too much boy am i glad i bought it ! the only thing i did n't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes i know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews , but i figured i should throw in my two cents anyway
when i saw this i though why not , it does n't look overly violent boy am i glad i tried it while there are the usual fight scenes the overriding theme is a wonderful sense of humor as a night owl , i adore the morning scenes using different , highly original , method to awaken the heroine a real keeper and i just wish it was a long series
this is the best way to spend the evening with your children it is very well done , and the actors made this a neverland not to forget we have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it , buy it , but most of all watch it
i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity , he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time , and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs , and you 're infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint , and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again , they come up with this idiotic scheme , which ended up in disaster \( both the hilton and auto world closed within a year \) moore in recent years has become a political celebrity , in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it 's not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them are n't really interested in changing anything , as it might interfere with their livelihoods i do n't know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent , darkly funny film about real class warfare , and the dismantling of the working class in america
leftist anti establishmentarian
a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast , great performances , great story , just a great film unique approach to the subject , characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion , characters played by julianne moore , don cheadle , heather graham , william h macy , and burt reynolds respectfully , are great to watch this is a performance piece
i love this movie how can you not with such hilarious diologue \? one of my most favorites is when yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of kuzko ending with a hilarious i 'll smash it with a hammer ! but diologue aside , there 's so much more to this movie the characters are so wonderfully individual , from self absorbed kuzko , to evil yzma with her secret lab , to dim witted kronk with his shoulder angel and devil
wonderful to find in the sale just as my tape was wearing out delightful movie , well acted by all but especially wonderful performance by bridges as the human alien hybrid a superb print too thanks amazon you did it again
frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound this is due to its subject , its star , and its director , julie taymor , who also gave us the astounding titus \( if you have not yet seen titus , do so before finishing this review it is an art director 's tour de force on a par with brazil \)
we enjoy listiening and watching this dvd on our hdtv we play this when have friends over with the volume low and find them humming or singing along
of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of allah on that day , this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching because of this , those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events and perhaps none more so than caesar in his review of sept 17 , 2006 if only he found at least as troubling the carnage , bloodshed , and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his islamic buddies against civilian populations but , more on this in a bit
wow , i watched this on the national geographic channel and i was so astonished at some of the details , that i had to buy it it should be a must buy for any library across this country i encouage every american to watch this
if you have never been introduced to thora birch this is the one to see i do n't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film if there were ever a star born this is it she is just unbelievable griffin and johnson are really great too this movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone
somehow denis leary and peter tolan managed to improve on an already amazing show rescue me continues to be the best show out there
i have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie i just know that i had to buy it b c i rented it so often napolean is such a loser his brother kip could have a huge l on his own forehead
falling in love 1984 is one of my favorite romantic 80s movies , i have two laserdisc copies one new and the other is used and i have it on dvd too , you gotta give it a try you will love it too
in all of the other x men dvds , they show very little on the couple that i like the best kitty and lance the first episode joyride , is when lance joins the x men not everyone is pleased , but almost all are scott is the one who hates lance and doese n't believe that lance is doing this out of truth well when cars , jets , start mysterisoly getting very dirtty scott blames it all on lance but is it lance or is someone else having the joyride \? \? and walk on the wild side is a episode very good towards girl power jean , boom boom , rouge , magma , kitty decide to become the bayville sirens stoping crime and wearing leather in the process the other two epsiodes are worth getting the disc after all , any x men dvd is worth it
now with the release of the '38 version of 'a christmas carol' i can once again enjoy the antics of the grumpy old ebenezer scrooge as played by reginald owens in my opinion not as good as the later alastair sim version in '51 , but all in all a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the whole family
this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch , even if it does n't feel as audacious as i'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby , it is the epitome of all opposites attract love stories as a twenty year old depressive connects with a 79 year old life loving woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death , as they keep showing up at the same funerals however , the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive , while the hearse driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all
this presents us with a visual voyage into music that , in my opinion , excels that if the original fantasia not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid , colorful , and highly diverse from segment to segment , but the representation of the music is , in itself , sheer genius as i have come to expect from disney , at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure this much , i believe , is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music
i have to say , it took me a while to getting around to seeing this i thought silence of the lambs was good it featured a great performance by anthony hopkins , and the rest of it was good but that was about it , as far as i was concerned it just did n't really click with me , and it was n't anything near the great movie i 'd been hoping for , so when its sequel was released i did n't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released a bit surprisingly though , i thought hannibal was really great once i finally did see it everyone said it was more geared toward horror than silence \( which is fine by me \) and it may have been , marginally but much more than that , it was just a better horror movie than its predecessor , and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie , in my opinion hopkins is just as good , if not better , than he was as dr hannibal lecter the first time around , and while i usually do n't like recasting roles in a movie \( unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you do n't see their real face or hear their real voice , and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong \) julianne moore did a great job stepping into the clarice starling role originally played by jodie foster
we just got this dvd last week , but ever since that time it has remained in the dvd player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter , cassidy she loves this dvd and all the planets that come to life she sings along and has really learned her planets the songs are top notch the dvd is enjoyable for adults , even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful a
moonlighting is one of the greatest series to ever grace television bruce willis and cybill shepherd have a chemistry that just makes the episodes work the scripts are well written , funny when they are supposed to be and serious when they are supposed to be all i can say is you should check it out and see for yourself i'm very happy i decided to buy these dvds
the five people you meet in heaven is a powerful book with many mixed emotions this film was a constant mystery as i never knew what would happen next the story is all about the people who affected eddie the most in his life the people he meets in heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking some people he knew , and some he had never met this was a great idea
microphone tap , tap , tap ladies and gentlemen ! for your wrestling entertainment , i introduce to you the lord 's luchador , the mauling monk , the orphanator ! put your hands together for naaaacho liiiibbbbre !
its been a long time since i have laughed this much ! ! ! ! getting down to the nitty gritty it is an enjoyable comedy the chemistry between jack black nacho and hector jimenez esqueleto is what makes the movie so funny his accent was not mexican but very funny my family and i just loved the movie , which i think we have seen 5 times in the theatre
this movie is a classic if you have n't seen it or heard of it , buy it now
very exciting and will keep you glued to your seat i have just watched \( 2006 \) for first time
federico fellini 's 1972 film is not his best , when he has 8 1 2 , la strada and la dolce vita to his credit while many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring and phantasmagorical it is simply fellini 's version of rome and not rome , the eternal city itself to risk sounding negative , i shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970 's rome the scenes in which the hippies and american tourists invade the city , the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off \( though saying some pretty vulgar things \) and my favorite scene the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old roman patricians fade into oblivion but mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot it starts off alright , and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences fellini is himself in this movie , as well as gore vidal fellini envisions himself as a young man studying rome in his youth in a strict catholic school \( the slide projector shows ancient monuments like the colliseum , the apian way , trevi fountain and vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman 's behind \) and later as a young man journeys to rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless , vulgar and long winded i found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage ! it bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women the cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film and for a film about rome and italy , there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater the pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous only serious , hardcore fans of fellini will want to own this dvd it is a perfect follow up to his equally absurd and sexually radical satyricon , loosely based on the old roman epic
this dvd is the bomb ! why \? prince puts on a show from morris day and the time \( a must see \) to the lenny kravitz and prince jam session true prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity
if you 're even showing an interest to vol 2 then you most likely own or have seen vol 1 even then i recommend this one as much as any of them , since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end anyways , vol 2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol did , but unfortunately when compared to vol 1 you 'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all any sword fighting that actually occur usually does n't last long enough to be considered a fight but this dvd makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol so enjoy it , i know i did
you gotta get the whole series you ca n't just get one or two dvds you need the whole thing , trust me once you start you gotta go all the way to the end
this movie is worth owning it 's a classic tale , well done and very entertaining
this is a great kid 's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot it 's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices \) i would suggest not over thinking the story line , it 's a kid 's movie after all and no its not all about the flying cars , believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more !
this is a classic musical that i grew up watching on network tv it has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys i bought it to share with my kids and they loved it
i did n't watch this one before
wow , i was so excited to see this available on dvd this is from the era of cartoon geniuses these cartoons are good for all ages and will never go out of fashion i can not wait to have kids and show this to them it beats the violence and tone of cartoons today this is my choice for a cartoon lovers collection a must have enjoy
i was just gonna watch the film because i think robert de niro is one of the greatest actors ever , but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of being black that truly adds another factor to this film it 's a trip out film
this movie has recieved several bad reviews and i can understand that this movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical first gay love movie , but if you like movies that are not , this one if a must have the movie is not a hardcore sex movie , in fact there is only one scene of sex , in the movie the positives of this movie are , it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love , one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray again , i only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex
i love this movie while the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film , she 's all that does n't go overboard and , surprisingly , presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata
what more could a true parrotthead ask for than jimmy buffett live at wrigley field \?
i have always enjoyed watching this movie , with so many great stars , some whom are no longer with us never owned it on video , now i have it on dvd , great price too ! ! it was worth it
if there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides saving private ryan , this is it
this is like the classic that killed other classics for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime so anime was never the same around this time based off the manga loosely i mean some parts are changed or edited over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh a very hyper violent film lot 's of action !
this film was originally titled the testimony of taliesin jones it is named for the hero , a little welsh boy whose mother leaves his farm family for a life in town his experiences are touching , and seem to involve a gift of healing
this dvd is the best dvd by far for how to dj awesome interviews and 2nd disc does excellent job of showing you all you need to know about how to dj do not waste money on other cheap and cheesy dj dvds like i did , spend the extra few bucks and i knwo you will be happy with this purchase
i was given the special fan remix edition of this film last christmas , and i must say , the so called bonus features only detract from the wonderful original so stick with the original
after buying the original the fast and the furious i found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it however , i can now say i am a fan of the trilogy \( all 3 films are good \)
michael par \( into the sun space fury \) , nancy allen \( limit up robocop \) , two famous star in 80 's , made this a five star sci fi movie but no subtitle or closed captioned , so i will give it 4 5 star
i am very disappointed with this movie the philadelphia experiment that have no english subtitles , due to my deafness i was planning to buy this dvd
this dvd takes some of the funniest episodes from the series the dvd is put together quite well and episodes are taped better than vhs the only problem is with 1 or 2 episodes it splits for a quick second , but i would recommend to anyone who like any lucille ball items
i love leslie sansone 's videos she 's quirky and a bit ditzy , but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun this is no exception there have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough , but i had absolutely no problems even on my first try if you do n't want to miss a beat , pay close attention at first you 'll hear the directions
excellent pay per view one of the best of 2002 here 's the matches
i found the movie to be very creative and unique i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set up for a play would be i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words message there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed greed true love spirituality determination self esteem issues and jealousy i am not a prince fan , but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day , and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman , who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them \( clever \) i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic , morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
sybil is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public the performances by sally field and joanne woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter \( child abuse \) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques , both the book and the movie became musts for students of abnormal psychology at that time and for decades afterwards
this is my first watp video , but i started at the highest mile because i am an intermediate advanced exerciser so i knew i needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going , but mostly i was looking for variety in my workout and i must say , i just love this video it is the only video i own that makes me want to do it i truly enjoy working out , but when i find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up , i know i hit the jackpot this workout can be perfect for most exercisers , although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the super challenge leslie is a good instructor , but as most have mentioned , she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh but its about the workout , not the sound of her voice , and in that , watp super challenge accomplishes alot i hope to buy more of her videos in the future
as an american i find this video showing the incredible distruction and the first responders who are operating at the scene of this enormous tragedy compelling to think that this terrorist attack actually happened on our soil is truly unbelievable another reviewer from france states that the footage is nothing special ! that is the furthest from the truth ! i guess the he believes that the terrorist attack never took place ! this is an historic document that should be seen by every american !
this is a great video , my daughter learned all her abc 's with the letter factory and now she is learning words and she is not even two yet ! go leap frog
i had no idea what i had missed i bought this set at sam 's club for 18 \( now i see what a deal i really got \) i watched every minute and loved it if you have n't seen it do ! and , maybe check out sam 's club for your own copy at an incredible price
very entertaining ! except few scenes , i really enjoyed this movie \( but hey , nothing is perfect , right \? except maybe lotr \) you should buy this dvd or at least rent it , watched , and then decide i watched it few times and i will more in the future ! good romantic comedy !
this is easily one of the best films of the 80 's kevin bacon is a god in this movie he plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil when the footloose song comes on the radio , my co worker tom and i cant help but busting into dance its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet ! ! buy this dvd for your collection and you 'll be bursting into dance before u know it !
an animated family of x men complete with spandex it all turns out pretty well incredible
it 's interesting to read some of the other reviews i ca n't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie it 's imaginative , as was nightmare before christmas , but goes beyond that movie with even better stop action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving i loved nightmare , but corpse bride takes all the things i loved and made them better the voices of all the actors ring true the mood is gothic and yet comical the score is rich and defines the movie perfectly \( the dvd allows you to watch the movie with only the music , and that 's a real plus \)
awesome ! bought for my husband for valentine 's day ! even our 8 year old son loved it excellent condition
great story great actors beautiful scenery and colors my favorite movie
student of history is a student of christian biased history there are plenty of qualified scholars , and current book like that of theologian bart ehman for one , who show that early christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree , but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in judea were about \( not paliestine ! the romans named the region palestine after the war against the jews in 70ce \) the fact that one man \( constantine \) sought a single authoritive finality was a political move , not an act or miracle of god authority of apostles is more christian myth and power assertion , not historical proof of the varacity of the bible and christian claims objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father \( probably iraneus \) forged copies of josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to jesus it is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then ! handwriting is sort of a give away , especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about jesus what is known about the gospel of thomas and other second century altnative christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner it might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts people with no authority like iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult he called arius of alexander for example , a heretic but he had no authority to do so he forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future , others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers paul called it lying to bring you the truth but a lie is a lie and historians ca n't make lies facts so the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth
i have loved this movie since i first it back in the early 1990 's in all honesty it is pretty crudy but that 's what i love about it the music is fantastic and the costumes are unique divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and ricki lake was perfect for the role link is pretty hunky too
i never tire of this film the acting , the marvelous filming locations , the costumes perfection i ca n't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing in fact , i once stopped the video , baked scones , and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa try it i now own the dvd also
i have no idea why i had never heard of this movie before because ronin is a whale of a good film i can take or leave most action films , but give me a taut , intelligent , suspenseful thriller filled with great action , wicked twists , and some of the best car chasing footage you 'll ever see , and i'm happy throw jean reno and the one and only robert de niro into the mix , as well , and i'm happier than any clam has a right to be director john frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone does n't make for a good action film , and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene
the bells of st mary 's was a shrewd move by paramount studios and director leo mccarey , whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical catholic priest father o'malley , going my way , spawned the 1945 release , which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict irish catholic mccarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed going my way and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the catholic world inhabited by father o'malley
i really did i would watch it almost everyday ! it was my favorite movie back then ! i held this tradition until \( sob \) my mom threw away our copy ! i do n't care if the tape was old ! i still wanna see it ! \( i'm gonna buy it on dvd soon ! \) fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy it 's an original story that should make you cry it even has a pretty funny ending ! i ca n't wait to see this movie again anyway , this movie is about a man who dies in a car crash and gets reincarnated as a dog i know a lot of peeps out there that do n't believe in reincarnation but just remember , this is fiction anyway , as he grows older , he wants to see his wife and kid even more he decides to find them he one day sees them in a parking lot \( and ca n't remember what they did , the last time i saw this movie was a couple years ago \) and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife she told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away \( i think \) i sadly ca n't remember what happened after that but i know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet the mother agrees , reluctantly i dont remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends and uh no ! i need to watch the movie again ! ! ! i just bought the book , so after i read the book , i plan to watch the movie bwa ha ha ! ! ! anyway , it 's a fun filled movie watch it
the guy shirtless , tied up , abs muscles so vulnerables to let the punisher to torture this guy until he cant almost breath and cry for mercy just an upper stomach being beaten to make this guy suffer a pain he will never forget
the story line was very moving anthony hopkins and morgan freeman are always fantastic in any movie they do it is well worth the price and well worth the time to watch
how many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy , perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat , lazy slob \? or maybe it was an arrogant hollywood trainer with that fitter than thou sneer these instructors just do n't seem like real people with real lives outside the gym , do they \?
witch hunter robin is a great series which i enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series the visuals are first rate , the music \( when there is music \) is beautiful , and the storyline is intriguing
season 1 of millennium featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made the x files look sunny by comparison unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a murder mystery of the week fare thankfully the second season , supervised by former x files producers glen morgan and james wong , changed all that the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end' , where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two , computer hacker brian roedecker
one of the most maligned movies of 2004 is not that bad in a fine example of how critics and hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it , oliver stone delivers an epic take on the life of alexander the great not up to par with the great hollywood epics , but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe
this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film
this movie is going to bring you down that 's a fact but it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves
seriously ! at the end of fat eliminator minna says do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change it 's true i have been doing this dvd and only this dvd for about a month now 3 days a week is fat eliminator and 2 days is strength and grace and my body is firm ! i have abs now , biceps and definition in my thighs and buns extra flab is gone this is a fantastic workout combination fe is tough , particularly the first three cardio circuits those plyo jumping jacks are killer once i get through that third cardio circuit though i feel like i 've already had a good workout and i'm only halfway through ! i work up a sweat i ca n't even answer the phone because i could n't talk even if i wanted to it 's definitely focused on your lower body with lots of jumping and plyo and core work but the circuits are quick and they really do go by quickly the workout is also fantastic in that just when you feel like you ca n't do one more plyo lunge , she changes the pace to something more less impact the 15 minute blast the fat toning section i always add onto the cardio days it 's nice , quick and effective and in one hour while my son is napping i get in a total body workout
the movie one of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90 's , and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved , this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind and despite the whining from some , usually hardline christian , corners , it 's not anti christian at all what it is is simply great , imaginative and clever film making , and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from mimi rogers , ably supported by the likes of david duchovny , will patton and patrick bauchau
there are many reviews here and i believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree my main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once if you do , it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place daniel day lewis once again makes this film you feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the wrong woman \( pfeiffer \) after being engaged to the right woman \( ryder \) he is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film due to circumstances beyond his control , he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman there is a palpable , underlying eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by day lewis and pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair
after the original , herbert west \( jeffery combs \) and dan cain \( bruce abbot \) have returned from medical miltary duty in south america as they return back home as they have perfected their re agent formula to continue experimentint but herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of cain 's old girlfriend meg to create the perfect re animated woman , however dr carl hill \( david gale \) has been re animated back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what west did to him
this show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal from the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i 've been a huge fan of the series i was so sad to hear it 'd been cancelled but i was n't surprised it was one of the shows i loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air now that the dvds are out i can relive these 13 fleeting moments in tv that are , to me , some of the funniest things i 've ever seen apart from the hilarious , oddball performances from michael michael and david the series was packed with guest stars including edward norton , paul rudd , and a whole lot more really , anyone that is a fan of comedy ala strangers with candy will find this funny it has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts
excellent series the court room scene is hilarious i am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti americanism of this series \( i refer to the portrayal of the american guest \) as well as in upstairs downstairs \? in both series , as in other british tv dramas , americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic what about the henry james edith wharton type aristocrats who toured england in the 19th century \? mr hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them
if you 're a fan of vampires , werewolves , action , or gothic suspense , this is probably a movie you 'd be interested in checking out while it 's not a groundbreaking film , it 's a highly entertaining one , and one that , for me , is something i can rewatch several times per year
this is the best animal movie i have ever seen from a child 's point of view this has been our daughter 's favorite movie for the last one year or so \( she 's 3 now \) and after watching it almost every day \( sometimes several times a day \) she still enjoys it as much ! we 're surprised that even we are not tired of it the animals are fun to watch , the story is interesting and the music is great we 've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them the production is superb , the animals did a great job and it all seems so real a must by for everyone who has small kids
as i understand it , police squad was one of the most requested titles for release on dvd it 's taken a while for it to happen , but it finally has ! it 's great to be able to replace my vhs tape that i recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a police squad marathon having now watched the dvd , i now know that for almost 20 years , i 've been watching heavily edited versions of the show but not anymore !
the full frame version is just that , the unmatted full frame of the filmed image the widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen \( this is how it was originally shown in theaters \) in two spots the dvd lies about the full frame version , saying that it 's a pan scan trimming of the widescreen picture
season 1 wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit , incredible acting for a tv series , and classic plots all around a great opening season for a classic show
dark atmospheric telling of the tale very decent ! it is a simply told ancient tale the scenery is gorgeous there 's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time it 's a good movie , a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end
i loved this movie for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done in the american version all it was was sarah michelle gellar 's face the japanese version was much better \( considering it was original and made more sense \)
this film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it the plot is not very intriguing , and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life , so it lacks this sense of reality a dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer , which is exactly the point of this movie
in all fairness , this film is advertized on the package as a docudrama and not as a drama the problem is that it is n't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary as a documentary about the reenactment , this is a fine collection of footage , interspersed with some \( thankfully \) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides \( actually , i thought the actor portraying longstreet did a fine job the others were less convincing \) as a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle
watching once and again is one of the most painful television shows to watch , let along watch again this is not because it is a bad television show , but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date i would like to be able to identify with rick , but my personal situation is more like that of jake , and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them watching once and again the complete second season on dvd , the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning there is a moment when she reads her parents , lily and jake , the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace , but also ending up with less years where the family \( scribbling rivalry \) anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again if you have been spared that particular experience , then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through
this was a blast from the past for my husband and i we purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it it fits right where they are in school , and they laugh while they are learning often when we are doing homework , i 'll say that 's what they said on the electric company or remember what the electric company said this letters sound like \? and they do it 's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them it 's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school plus i have to admit , seeing morgan freeman and bill cosby in this is quite hilarious \( mistakes and all !
using the g8 summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed \( at least to me \) like a recipe for disaster , but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy , the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem do n't miss it
this is a very enjoyable , laid back film about the music and spirit of one of our greatest rock musicians i love neil young 's music , and i love this film
i went into this dvd with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it maybe enjoy is n't the right word , it is intense , it is political \( and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics \) and it jumps around from subplot to subplot in fact , i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks but i found it very plausible and that is what a good movie should do give a plausible thesis and play it out it succeeds here it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence sure , it makes the gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them , but that usually makes for a good starting point , since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and or greed anyway i once heard a history professor say it is n't about the struggle of good vs evil , it is always about the struggle of good vs good both sides always think they are right and god is on their side watch it , you will come out the other side thinking
this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from mr gore , but this movie gave me a new realization that being in office would have held this man back his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do mr gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes he gives a website climatecrisis net for more ideas and info if you think this might be too boring for your taste , give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish
i thought this movie was pretty good i 've seen a lot of nicholas cage movies \( 8mm , the rock , con air , etc \) so maybe i am biased towards him
i enjoyed ice age , and this movie is good as well thankfully , all of the cast from the original ice age returned , and the comedy as well and , besides the characters , the story is another original idea , and a great stand alone movie by itself , and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one the ice age is coming to an end , and our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for higher ground before their valley gets flooded manny , along the way , begins to question his own mortality and the fact that he is the last mammoth or is he well , that what everybody thinks , until they run across a family of opossums do n't see how opossums and mammoths tie together , just watch the movie queen latifah was a good addition to the cast great film , one for the collection
star wars , in any format , will always be the greatest movie of all time
what a great story and an ending ! i was so excited about the conclusion of this 2 hr program that i coud n't sleep at all
wonderful
monk is quite an interesting show it is about this character named adrian monk \( played by tony shalhoub , wings \) , who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias he is also incredibly intelligent he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly , provided that he has all the right clues the most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words , which , for some of the most intense cases , will really shock the audience i 've solved the case however , for some reason , the best part always seems to be when he says , here 's what happened
i did not see john carpenter 's original version of assault on precinct 13 , but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake i was paying attention so i knew what the set up was , both inside and out of the precinct , as we went along but being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in james demonaco 's script \( i made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters i was sure would survive all the bullets and i was half right , which is a polite way of saying i was half wrong \)
maybe better than the original i liked that they focused on wonka 's childhood throughout the film that was something that really added to the storyline they really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal , too i guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original was n't anywhere to be seen in this one , but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it
having seen stella 's live show in hollywood , i had a sneaking suspicion that i was going to love their comedy central show , and i was not disappointed these guys have mastered the art of genius disguised as idiocy , and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end i guess i'm not surprised it did n't last this kind of humor is n't for everyone but come on we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include mind of mencia and blue collar comedy , both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer these guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years , and i hope to see them in another show or movie soon until then , i 'll be enjoying stella on dvd
that is really what a b c said when they took this , the funniest show ever on t v , off the air in less than six shows my friends in high school and i watchedcthis show every time it came on it was a parrody of all the cop shows from the 60 's and 70 's and was falling down funny later the group who gave us airplane would retool their baby into the naked gun movies and make a mint at the boxoffice each show could be watched many times just to catch the jokes you missed i'm so happy that they have all six shows on dvd now , and i can get rid of the old cut up copy that i had on vhs and remember smoke , yes i know , but what happened
this film is a gripping true life portrait of the path poverty takes when it \( poverty \) decides to destroy life and hurt those who cannot defeat its ties of depression
i really loved this story ! each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding
the thing i like about this movie was that it was wholesome , something the whole family could watch together without having to worry about bleeping the bad parts out ! cute , entertaining story with some romance thrown in for interest
stagecoach is significant , along with destry rides again , for redefining the western for adult audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes \( the gambler , the prostitute with a heart of gold , etc \) but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah , dallas , and thomas mitchell as doc boone , for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless
i watched this movie and once it finished i decided i had to log on to amazon and buy it up this film is so well done , from the characters , the actors , the dialogue and the stories a pure enjoyment to watch i hope everyuone sees it at least once
this film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted occasionally the film lets itself down with it 's editing i sometimes feel disorientated thinking wait slow down will you having said that this film is well acted , and really puts you in the netherlands of the 19th century it may not be as hard hitting and exciting as turkish delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching
i love good underrated movies , they make you feel like you 're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs i'm not a movie buff , but deep cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic great acting , memorable lines , interesting \( and logical \) plot and a decent ending
where do i start \? jack nicolson is a magnificant actor he can play anybody and his performance in this film was top notch i recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out i guarantee you will be satisfied
spider man \( 2002 \) the first spider man film
i saw this movie for the first time when i was 5 i'm still watching it at 65 they will never be another movie to surpass this one
the movie was terrific , and the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars , was because there was quite a bit of spanish in the film , and the subtites from spanish to english did n't seem to work on my copy english subtitles appeared for engliish , and spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke spanish ! strange fortunately i know some spanish , so i could sort of pick it up , but i do n't know why the sub titles did n't work anyway , bogie was very good and the story was too three men set out to find gold , and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey besides all that were the usual bandits and indians and so forth but it kept you watching and that 's what really counts wo n't tell you if they got any gold !
i thought this was a very good film well written filmed cast and acted very dark humor i myself would have used lawyers guns and money by warren zevon and knockin' on heavens door , bob dylan on the sound track
this movie is so touching i loved the determination of the girl it 's been a while since i 've seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters' names my children got hooked on foreign films after watching this movie with me a great family movie or just a clean chick flick
i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it ! ! ! !
ellen , the young boy 's stepmother , gets involved in this frightening story quite by accident in the shower it is necessary to actually tear apart the shower door to attempt to save her the pulse is in the tv , the electricity , the hot water everywhere naturally nobody believes them when they try to explain what it is i have watched this video several times and i'm still not sure myself a real thriller get it while you can exclusively at amazon com
i ca n't wait for this second season to finally be released i bought the first set on a whim and wow was i pleasantly surprised i never knew alfred hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro 's and exits during each episode
what can one add to what 's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time \? citizen kane has been analyzed more than any other movie , in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as kane itself it 's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary the battle over citizen kane and the hbo film rko 281
fred astaire plays a dnacer returning to england from a trip abroad in the customs shed he meets ginger rogers in an embarassing predicament he tries to find out who she is , but she refuses to tell him , and he spends ages searching london for her until he finally tracks her down and begins to awaken her interest ginger goes down to brighton with her friend dithery much married alice brady , and astaire and his dithery lawyer friend edward everett horton go in pursuit ginger has gone to brighton to try and obtain a divorce , she intends to spend the night with a professional co respondent somthing astaire says makes her think he is the co respondent , which puts her right off him fortunately the real co respondent , a diminutive italian , turns up \( your wife is safe with tonetti , he prefer spaghetti \) and the mystery is sorted out but what will happen when ginger 's husband arrives the next morning \? will she get her divorce this is a wonderful film , with a silly but extremley funny plot , and some wonderful dialogue , particularly between horton and brady , who somehow manage to end up married to each other , much to their surprise an absolutely delightful film
this dvd set was outstanding the 5th and 6th seasons of seinfeld were at the height of the show great extras !
the legend of zelda complete animated series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children 's cartoon should be , right there with teenage mutant ninja turtles , street sharks , and recess the legend of zelda was \( and still is \) such an exceptional video game series for all ages , and the tv show followed in its footsteps it combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one liners , and some jokes that still today make me laugh lookin' good , princess ! 'specially from this angle ! as children we see link yell that to zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences but later , that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee , and wonder how we ever missed it before
this is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor i really enjoyed watching it i think it has great replay value as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness i found it more reminiscent of the old 60 's films like 'monte carlo or bust' or 'those magnificent men ' jackie chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action packed foil to 'fillius fogg' played with brilliant english reserve self deprecating humor by 'steve coogan' there 's no comparison to the original the film does n't even try to copy rather , it takes a silly story with silly character 's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action adventure comedy movies you 'll see because this is n't a typical 'martial arts' vehicle for 'jackie chan' i found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline check out for instance the fight scene in the art gallery which goes to show why 'jackie chan' is probably the best action comedy star in the world right now there 's much that 's chaplain keaton like in his performance all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts the guest stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices , most notably 'it 's a mad , mad , mad , mad world' \( what i think is the best comedy ever this is by no means a comparison \) anyway 'arnold swarzenneger' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a turkish prince no less \( possibly the poorest arabian impression ever , which is of course why it works so well \) and 'rob schneider' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice miss 'cecile de france' is a beautiful comedy foil manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent i hope to see more from her you might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but i found a lot of it to be nicely restrained , this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set , check out the extras all in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy action adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing
the main character , lebowski , is a bum of a person living in los angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by john goodman and steve buscemi suddenly lebowski 's life is changed when he is mistaken for another lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters
the dude , that or , uh , his dudeness , or , uh , duder , or el duderino if you 're not into the whole brevity thing those are the dude 's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other jeffery lebowski you 're probably thinking what is he talking about , who is the other jeffery lebowski \? , well i 'll tell you in just a moment , i 've just got some things to clear up first joel and ethan coen have made some of the most loved films of all time , and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos team of all time these fellows bought you the cult favourite blood simple , the hillarious raising arizona , the decietful millers crossing , the crazy barton fink , the hudsuckers proxy , and the blood drenched fargo , and now this , one of the finest films they 've done , the big lebowski jeff bridges is jeffery lebowski or in this case , the dude john goodman plays the vietnam veteran walter , steve buscemi is not in it too often , but he plays the loveable donnie let 's just go through the character sketches \( only the dude 's bowling pals \)
i was a teenager in the 80 's , so i love all of the old 80 's teen movies , but some kind of wonderful makes my top three the performances were believable the actors became the characters , not the other way around eric stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks \( literally \) who wants to pursue art instead of business mary stuart masterson is his best friend , a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him lea thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty and her boyfriend craig scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend and the only off note
based on historical events which are still poorly undertsood , this movie depicts werner heisenberg and niels bohr the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the 1920s and 1930s caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to heisenberg 's famous uncertainty principle \( which demonstrates mathematically that you cannot know both the exact speed and position of a single electron \) drawing from the tony award winning play by michael frayn \( who also wrote noises off \) , the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men \( sometimes together with bohr 's wife \) who meet in copenhagen in 1942 when heisenberg , the german , who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb , visits his mentor and colleague bohr , the dane who is living through nazi occupation of his native land there are deep unresolved questions about the motives of heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue , the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow , including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and bohr 's home note i enjoyed the movie as much as the play in an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers , this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance
i enjoyed the first season and got it eagerly awaiting season 2 see it for sale overseas in the uk but not here \? tough waiting so long sigh i can do other formats besides north america but it 's a pain c'mon guys , i 'd rather spend the money here
the grapes of wrath is a great movie , perhaps one of the best i have ever seen however , having read the book , i notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out by taking out these crucial , yet quiet scenes the movie has a faster pace than the book
why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release \? connery in a remake of thunderball is this not a relesae by the same production company \? it is a mgm release , so why does n't it ever get included \? any light that can be shed would be greatly appreciated
there simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than frank gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work he has both his passionate lovers and haters i am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle i really love some of his work , while i find some of his work to be quite off putting the person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of gehry 's work , art critic claude jencks \( the person who popularized the term postmodern \) jencks , for whose deceased wife gehry designed a memorial building , states bluntly that gehry has made some ugly buildings i think with gehry more than most architects , one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition whatever else one may say about gehry , he is n't like other architects
we love these movies ! they entertain the child as well as the adult ! we went through a period where we watched these every night before bed ! much better than the baby einstein collection ! we 've made this our designated baby shower gift ! everyone should have a copy ! they are good for parents as a stress relief you do n't even need to watch them , just have them playing in the background , the music is absolutely wonderful i love when i catch my kids humming the music as they are playing perfect for any age , boy or girl ! thank you hbo
i loved the movie it has a lot of hidden symbols , like almodovar is accustomed to doing however , the music was the best
warner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore and or polish up their best movies and again they do not disappoint ! warner home video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time ! the set is well presented with excellent digital transfer , wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras
the great dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director , charlie chaplin the movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of world war 2 and at the rise of the nazi party the similarities between dictator adolf hitler and the comedic genius that is charlie chaplin is quite interesting both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year , same month , in the same week chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing hitler for this film he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film
every film in this collection is a gem annie hall and manhattan are both top notch , followed by bananas , everything you wanted to know about sex , sleeper heck , even interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice but to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are stardust memories and love and death these two films are probably woody 's least talked about , but really , i think they are both fantastic films love and death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his earlier , funnier works but you can see in the dialogue of love and death that woody was maturing and stardust memories , my favorite woody film this film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an artist who is trying to figure out what they want to say and how to say it maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these dvd 's but for the money , you ca n't beat the price of this set
these movies are beautiful and intense , one of those you must watch and enjo
if you 're looking for a silly movie with no content , this is not a collection for you the series is a great insight to a range of human emotions and finding your true self i recommend it to anybody who loves good movies just beware this set has english subtitles , so if you do n't like that you can think twice before commiting to a purchase
i don`t like it a whole lot , but it`s pretty good ! i liked the older elmo movies better than this one

i'm not one to go in length about films on amazon , but i 'll write a short little bit for this amazing film i first saw this 10 years ago when i was in my teens and have never forgotten it , it really touched something inside of me , much like a great piece of art would affect you after seeing it up close for the first time
hal hartley never fails to entertain , never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level simple men is no exception the seemingly simple plot two brothers in search of their missing dad provides so much room for character growth that i wish there were an entire series of films centered around them
not being familiar with yoga , i chose this dvd because of rodney yee 's reputation and the low cost what i found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed , and yet energized , after the first session there are no bells or whistles , just a great workout i 've purchases two other titles in the series , power yoga strength and power yoga stamina , and i switch off each workout some of the moves are more difficult than others , but it gives you something to work up to if i could n't do a stretch , i would go as far as i could and hold it it was a great feeling when i was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly i was unable to do aside from these video 's , the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain i do know this for a fact
if you love adam sandler 's comedy , you 'll adore this outstanding snl compilation of the best of adam sandler it features all his best skits , and outlines how great and wonderfully talented this actor comedian is also featured in this dvd are skits with the great chris farley , mike myers , and other great snl stars
when daryl deever \( william hurt \) tells tv reporter tony sokolow \( sigourney weaver \) he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor , he gets more than he bargained for deever is a good guy , smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms he 's sort of engaged to his best friend 's sister , but he 's had a crush on sokolow for two years when the man in the building gets his throat slit , sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her , so he tells her he may know something she goes after the story and he goes after her sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated , capable man known as joseph \( christopher plummer \) , who is good friends with sokolow 's parents it becomes clear that her wealthy parents , their rich friends and joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for jews to escape from the soviet union and to journey to israel and it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement , too before long , the man 's associates learn of deever 's gambit with sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing more lethally , the real murderer learns of what deever said to sokolow and believes deever might actually know something he goes after deever
most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult that 's why i love melville 's le samourai , not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles this film does n't require many lines of speech the main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect while trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him my first melville film and i loved it if you like this one you should also see le cercle rouge and especially bob le flambeur
there is n't one wasted second in this film not one ! ! ! you 'll be sucked in , and surprised , within the first two minutes , and there 's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading you can tell there 's a lot of influence from american film noir in this film , but le samourai takes it to a level of perfection i wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch le samourai they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done brilliant

all monty python movies are a must see i think my generation has seen them all i hope the younger generation \( less than 40 \) watch at least one the humor is at many levels , so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing like all good humor , it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general , as well as , politics and religion \( without getting nasty \)
everybody knows the plot of this movie so , i ca n't add anything in that respect however , i can tell you that the quality of the dvd is very good clear picture and sound great buy

what a truly stunning film , this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry , more of these should see the light
this film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters however , its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful , the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences , and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul although i have recommended this film to several people , i caution them that it can be pretty disturbing i thought about it for weeks after i saw it the first time , and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again definitely not a light hearted evening of entertainment
i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very much most of these movies are from the 30 's and 40 's , the hayday of movie mysterys the transfers are ok , but not great and some of the movie have sterotype 's of all kinds just keep in mind when they were made , and if they bother you do n't watch a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio
introduction
well at least its in my top 5 o \) i'm not the biggest chaplin fan more of a keaton and lloyd kinda guy but dang if this movie dose n't do me in everytime i never fail to fall into hysterics over the feeding chair scene or the gibberish song and several other scenes and i always get teary eyed over the plight of charlie and his little love gamin this movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next ! do n't be botherd by the hype about this being a social commentary or a commie film or whatever ! its still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order ! ! now i have this wonderful new 2 disc mk2 version from the chaplin collection box to pull out every christmas holiday season along with city lights as i'm want to do and check out the little cuban documentary on the second disc about the traveling projectionists who take the movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first time the tears in these peoples eyes as they watch tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film
it have a plenty range of glould 's legacy personally i hate the contemporary music , honestly i bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic partita no 6 in e minor it have a rear romatic influence , and definitly it do n't have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957 nonetheless you will see the great personality of glenn and its lively interpretation
if you can get through david 's boot camp video with moderate effort , this video may be a bit too easy for you that said , this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser david does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form he is very encouraging throughout the workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used \( two dumbbells needed \) there are a few innovative moves thrown in as well
i was reading some reviews of the quiet man earlier this year and a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time , entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children , grandchildren and i imagine great grandchildren
this is an outstanding dvd i highly recommend it if you have seen riverdance live you can relive the great moments if you have n't seen riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this dvd from the comfort of your own home
you should see this because it has an eary appearance by america \( yes , peo ple , that is her real name \) ferarra ! ! ! who , you ask \? \? oh \( casually \) only the star of ugly betty \( looks up , says ala pulp fiction \) oh , do i have your attention now \? \? \? \? also in this movie is roary from gg \( gilmore girls for the ignorant \) the only thing i didnt like was the blonde who had sex with the older man , not only was it innapropriate , but also illegal ! ! ! ! wso , parents be aware of this if you 're daughter 's want to watch this movie it has sexual content ! ! ! ! especially if they are under age ! now , peo ple , i am a male and also over 18 so i can watch what i want , but i'm just saying that for young girls they should n't watch this one ! ! ! but we all can watch ugly betty ! ! ! !
i thought this was an excellent coming of age movie very poignant in parts love the soundtrack as well ! these days is an especially beautiful song
for all true dream theater fans , this is a must have dvd ! the only drawback to score that i found was that they did n't play never enough , but that should n't prevent you from purchasing score i have watched the dvd over 10 times already and it has n't gotten old for me
for those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired , all i can say is that you wo n't be disappointed this series is one of my all time favorite tv shows when i discovered it was on dvd i snapped it up right away the picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version i originally saw this is the first tv series i have ordered on dvd and i was afraid the picture quality would be vhs boy was i wrong , this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd i have ever purchased if you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series
my kids just love this movie barbie in the 12 dancing princesses it is a very clean movie it is not scary except for the mean duchess but she really is n't scary , just mean it teaches about honesty and family , and how they care about each other which is really good for children to see plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch
before we first rented one of the barbie videos for my daughter , i was expecting them to be trite , over commercialised , and over sugary however , i have been pleasantly surprised
one of m g ms brightest , cheeriest musical astair and garland are most engaging screen couple the uplifting irving berlin score is first rate and used to perfection strolling along 5th avenue in turn of the century or going on the bum as a couple of swells , judy garland \( 1922 1969 \) and fred astaire \( 1899 1987 \) lead a parade of music 17 \( irving berlin 1888 1988 \) tunes and an academy award winning adaption score arranged by johnny green \( 1908 1989 \) and roger edens \( 1905 1970 \) and gotta dance fun \( including drum drum crazy \) in this neverending delifgt co starring ann miller \( 1923 2004 \) performing a knock out shaking the blues away and peter lawford \( 1923 1984 \) gamely crooning the fella with the umbrella with garland dont let this colorful easter parade pass you ! all new digital transfer from restored picturre and audio elements super tehnicolor and super sound highly recommended
a french coming of age art film that i rented while on vacation despite rave reviews all over the packaging , this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable , even a bit tedious jet lag set in and we gave up two thirds of the way through the film , and took it back the next day in all fairness , this is probably a fine film if you 're in the mood for serious art , but i found it a bit dreary
this is a really scary movie i 've always put ju on on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever , but this movie surpasses that movie i did n't expect much , seeing the title of the movie which does n't sound scary at all , but was i wrong , dead wrong if you are a horror fan , you got to see this movie the terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck asian horror movies do n't rely on gore , but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops contemporary american horror movies do n't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks asian horror movies like this one , which is korean , is not an original idea , but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better other asian titles i recommend are ju on , dark water , and the red shoes
a fun musical comedy , the trouble with girls is n't the usual elvis presley film but it 's completely charming with it 's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast
i really enjoyed this movie death warrant was filled with supense and action jean claude van damme portrays officer louis burke who goes undercover to investigate murder and corruption in the prison system eventually officer burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars
fargo is a very good film the cohen brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film the film stars jerry lundegaard \( william h macy \) as a car salesman in dire need of money when he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom , things go from bad to worse i could n't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers the father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom , and decides to act on his own jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess moreover , he has a saavy police chief \( mcdormand \) on the case
i thought the film was great , it has a interesting storyline it also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on
i did this workout for the very first time today and i do n't think i 've felt ever felt this good about myself this dvd works it 's not high impact aerobics , but i do n't think i 've ever sweat that much in one workout before and i totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy i'm not in very good shape , so i need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout \( i did n't think i 'd like this dvd because it is one of the longer ones ana and ravi put out \) i am really , really looking forward to getting the other two fat free dvds to add to my collection
i think this is a great film many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it 's running time \( 128 minutes \) , insisting it 's too slow almost all of clint 's films \( the ones he 's directed \) run long the running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours \( the longest being bird , at 2 hours , 40 minutes \) sure , the film is n't pc , but it was made in 1975 , when you did n't have to be pc but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic clint did all his own stunts in these sequences , and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences and they are very intense to watch , because you know the actors are really up there no cgi in those days this is one of the reasons they work so well cgi looks fake anyway it makes movies seem like cartoons people know it is n't real cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood , as it takes the tension out of action scenes
recently realizing that jackie chan and jet li are about done with movie making for the most part , i always wondered if there was anyone who could take over chan and li are one of a kind and the best out there fortunately , tony jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own the first thing i like about tony jaa is he is an expert in muay thai fighting , something new and original for the good guy in a movie the next thing i like is that he fights like jet li and does stunts like jackie chan , though once again he adds his own originality quite often
a friend of mine told me about this movie and i went to the local video store and rented it crazy ! ! ! i thought that the cgi and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real however , after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie live ! ! jackie who \? \? \? bruce what \? \? jet whatchamacallit \? \? \? \? he is the martial arts star for the new generation for those that see the decline of martial arts movies , this kid gives us hope
a hilarious movie , made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you 'd find in the object of it 's spoofing , top gun the film is loaded with abrahams 's usual sight gags , puns , slapstick , and quick wordplay there 's always something going on in the background , making for fun repeat viewings the overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience besides that , it 's educational , too ! you 'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is
the product is a1 but why arewe penalised for late delivery in the form of warfage ! ! ! ! ! shurly this is wrong \? \?
this dvd was better than i could have asked for it uses footage from the tv show this week in baseball twib , and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of america 's pastime it goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including tim hudson , ryan dempster , select phillies players , many others , as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as tommy lasorda and yogi berra if you love twib 's how 'bout that section of the show , you will adore this dvd
this is a sad little gem of a movie i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love the story had as much to do with issues of identity , community , and fidelity in my opinion , there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved , especially when considering the quality of the performances the slight quiver in weisz 's voice was right on target as was perez 's accent the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable considering the type of story and the setting , i ca n't help but think that a three part mini series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character
i have watched the first disk of the tick , and i laughed my ass off ! ! i am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to comedy central , and requst that they air the first season on their channel i think that fox screwed up by cancelling this show , and that comedy central should pick it up it is by far the best show i have seen in awhile , and deserves to be resurrected ! ! thank you
i'm the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club i use it 's so bad that my so called friends would n't even go to the range with me anymore because i embarrassed them too much i was the butt of all the jokes at the office too
martin short joins the cast in this volume , securing this show 's enduring genius and originality the cast , brilliant as always , never fail to deliver
tales from the crypt theme music plays , as the camera shoots through a spooky haunted mansion the camera reaches the basement , out pops the crypt keeper with his menacing cackle tales from the crypt this show is one of my all time favorites i used to sit in front of the television with my father every saturday night when this show came on the stories in this show were so amazing and so well done , that i could n't help myself when i became hooked on the show , and i was only four years old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989
visually aurally this is a feast ! great musicianship , excellent lighting , colour , camera angles etc etc if you know like pat know the piece you wo n't be really disappointed but the reason it 's 4 not 5 for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star first , there 's no intro \( the first note is struck with the title screen still showing \) no pictures of the band standing taking the crowd 's ovation \( the credits start rolling straight after the last note \) i always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere , location occasion before and after the music starts playing second , those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary guitar trumpet interplay closing out part two well , i'm not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth great of course but could 've been even better ! this said , 4 for a pat product still means a must buy !
'the bunker' is one of three films that deal with hitler 's final days as the soviets encircle berlin and put an end to the third reich in april may 1945
this is a fantastic video i use it regularly for teaching it gives a wonderful sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist , as well as a glimpse of the other artist 's work who are interviewed in the video it is filmed in a very immediate and personal style there is nothing stiff , boring , or disconnected about it , common faults of many art videos anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck 's event very moving , and not at all sappy
bergman first introduced us to johan and marianne in his 1974 masterpiece scenes from a marriage , one of the cinema 's most exacting dissections of our all too human failure to connect bergman and the splendid scandanavian actors erland josephson and liv ullmann took us through johan and marianne 's marriage , divorce , and post divorce reconciliation in the end , they live apart , but still make room for the bond between them
the enduring legacy around fran ois truffaut 's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from henri pierre roch semi autobiographical novel and in showing that elusive rapport , oskar werner , henri serre and especially jeanne moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the french new wave fortunately , the two disc criterion collection dvd set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic , although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times
i 'll tell ya if i read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing bakshi , i think i'm going to start kicking rump and taking names do people diss disney \? hardly , until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch
trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept they did it in saw ii , house on haunted hill , and then there were none , and i'm sure quite a few others but that plot seems to always work it does for me house of 9 is no exception it does n't follow a storyline that 's predictable , even though the plot is not unknown there are surprises , suspense , thrills and tense moments believe me , you wo n't predict the ending i was very satisfied with the movement of this film it 's an interesting watch
samuel jackson and kevin spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances jackson is always great to watch for his intensity , and this role suits that to a tee spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance this film and its settings supporting cast are slightly dated by today 's standards , but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it highly worthwile
spider man 2 is better than the original spider man i feel i should get that out of the way first , since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one however , i feel spider man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade spider man , it should naturally be better that 's what this sequel feels like , a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there it 's a good film , but it 's not really the way i thought a sequel should be
had just enough tasteful sex to satisfy and oh yes , the movie was good too
old boy is the second film in the revenge trilogy by park the first is sympathy for mr vengeance and the final being sympathy for lady vengeance
an absolutely wonderful film by clint eastwood thelonious was an amazing man he said things on the piano that we wordsmiths are n't able to communicate his unusual character made for an interesting subplot this film is footage of the man himself , usually playing his music i'm just sitting here being stunned
the thin man movies were funny and sophisticated when they came out and remain so it seems rare today to find such rich dialogue
anchor bay has come through again with this wonderful set of paul verhoeven 's early films all of the transfers are top notch and the subtitles are very clear and concise as the individual titles have already been reviewed seperately , the big draw to this collection is being able to collect all of these brilliant films for much less than their retail price the collectible booklet that 's included provides plot summaries and quotes from the director and or cast member \( s \) overall , i highly recommend this collection for even the casual filmgoer who is looking for that unique film experience
great acting and development in the multi linear plot movie very heavy movie however , that may be out of some people 's reach as to understanding and appreciation strisand and nolte were both brilliant
the tale starts out with a historical reference to chaucer for a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected and then you see the michael powell and emeric pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid evil times to present day \( 1944 \) england
this documentary is very concise , and very straight forward it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir it features interviews with some very credible sources , all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together this documentary makes a great point and i 'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics
one of the best movies i have seen ! ! ! the subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal' boundaries after watching this movie , you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does
monty python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever they made a tv show , monty python 's flying circus , and several hilarious movies
we have both of these , although we purchased them seperately save yourself the time and money and just get them together the magical halloween adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides , pumpkin patches , carving pumpkins and making cider there is a cute songs about monsters not being scary the elmo says boo ! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has elmo all over it we have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that in my opinion , they are not scary also , we watch them year round especially the elmo one she will pull it out and ask for it who knew you could have halloween in july \? \?
i spent ten years working various scenes at the trinity church hellhouse yes , it is a bit campy , and yes , it is often over the top , but i can say that the people are well intentioned , just a bit off target i attended trinity church from birth until i was 22 years old i do not attend their anymore because of the close minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary i stopped doing hellhouse when they added the decision room my last year i just felt it was an un biblical scare tactic i now feel that way about the entire operation the worst feeling i get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves i know because i was once one of them i have found that a growing number of former trinity youth group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons i listed above this movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist christian churches
this is a movie you 'll want to watch over again a number of times for a number of reasons for one , you 'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go round \( perhaps the second and third go round , too , and even beyond \) as the legend goes , with the exception of a few brief , well timed breathers , director howard hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film 's sleek 92 minutes , with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once
i do n't usually like romance films , but 2046 is brilliant !
i have ever seen what to say for this film great acting , great story and great music do n't hesitate go get it this will be one of the gems in your movie collection
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame , i love a good suspense horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
if you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child , pass on this one this movie has so many drug references , i ca n't even begin to explain \( trust me , i just so happen to have taken acid before \) this is a movie that never should have been directed toward children
fun to watch but my 9 1 2 yr old daughter could not follow the moves neither could i for that matter we tried to learn the moves through breaking it down but there is just not enough repetition too complicated
every review i 've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and i just do n't get it no one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it , and by then you 're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters , it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next if you like extremely broad slapstick humor and find that totally charming , then i guess i can see the appeal everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases i have to wonder what they could be damned melon ! or i passed out when i broke my wrist , and when i woke up , the cast was already on ! \? \? \? i will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor , because they say completely different things , or omit speech altogether in sum , do n't waste your time
the acting was very good the pace was adequate however , the plot was predictable the movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome clive 's character kept calling this the perfect robbery the characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters ca n't possibly know what is going on i'm still not sure what jody foster 's character brings to the plot
wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself , wo n't enjoy two womanizers fall in love , one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin , like first off , what does virginity have to do with love \? second , who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin \? then owen wilson 's character fall in love with rachel 's mcadams character and well , that 's the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it 's not that funny it seems to think it 's better then it is i do n't think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course , because it 's this kind of film , he ends up being gay and of course , he tries to hit on vince vaughn 's character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay guy is prob one of the worst actors i 've seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell , alot of people i know find this guy so funny but i do n't get it it just was n't funny to me u know , i loved the classic , american pie that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy ! this film was n't so much funny as stupid for the most part , i'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it 's just an average film
it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology , from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification this is a very dull , shapeless , stilted movie i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds , but since it is above all a piece of propaganda , i'm compelled to condemn it as history what it presents is the war between the states version of the civil war , in which the gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills and dales , their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north there are only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters otherwise , slavery is beside the point the generalship of lee and jackson , of course , is idolized , while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools the battle scenes are perfectly predictable guys charge on foot , other guys shoot , the fields are littered with bodies would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting \? how real is it to show only one train , and that southern , in a war won more by transportation than by musketry \? if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession , if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing about slavery by william lee miller , a professor at the university of virginia it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives , over slavery , in the 1830s , twenty five years before the election of lincoln the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought , and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides , blue and grey
maybe for some people , to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal , but in matt sullivan 's case , it could be a total nightmare
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
editorial reviews
i'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really was n't much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap you 'd expect from a family friendly movie , though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just does n't do comedy all that well , at least for a lead role jame garner , the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character
this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen its not sad its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96' but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television
i was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and ghibli studios previous works all the greater the disappointment then , when less than half way through , the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original , several key characters are lumped together most confusingly , and others lose all their complex charm what a shame
along with the nanny , the stepdad , the cable guy , the 14 year old girl with a crush we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes , everyone is out to get us or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe
well , i sure could have skipped this one i well remember the critics raving over this on television , but why is beyond me mostly , i was just plain bored there simply was no depth at all , just bunches of short takes and wise cracks bush was just downright dirty , making insults and slurs all over the place , something i do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be president and it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that mary matalen , the deputy manager of bush 's campaign and very acid tongued \( maybe she wrote some of the slurs bush used \) , is now the wife of james carville , top strategist for clinton 's campaign , and basically the star of the movie but all the scenes were focused on the funny quip , the bon mot , no long scenes of the nitty gritty work , or any answers to any questions about clinton either , for that matter
so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing
from start to finish a total waste of time i viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman , we were all appalled at how desparate this pamela was note to the director not all women waiting on god are that desparate the so called christian principals in this movie were laughable at the end of the movie i found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time
this movie was so horrible i do n't know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly , i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi christian plays , why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore , i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery fornication this movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of god if you 're in love in fact , christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice by even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where ce ce peniston 's character says seductively , i'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus yet she 's dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing , why did ce ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she 's dressed one way , by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition , the soundtrack , it was just annoying at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly , it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate \( although some are \) however , having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just , well , almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall , this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity
this has got to be one of the worst , most unrealistic movies to date i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks rarely are they done well this one , however , takes it to a whole new level what was courtney love thinking \? !
this movie did n't do anything for me did n't care for the characters or the plot the ending was disapointing also
cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today
this dvd gives documentary coverage concerning such da vinci code topics as rosslyn chapel , the priory of scion , the knights templar , the gnostic gospels , le dossier secrets , da vinci paintings , and opus dei
i saw this at the library and brought it home , thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the 1950 's , but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable , and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran , we did n't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography , and for the most part it seemed like the costumes , hair , way of speaking , etc were accurate for the time period \( so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when \) but something just was n't quite right , and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children , because of the nudity
i'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming , but i feel ripped off just the same
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement , highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and , conversely , what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica \( kim basinger \) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery 1 what is it \?
this is the worst transfer of a movie \( that is not a tape to tape before dvd bootleg \) that i have ever seen many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights , or so it appears , and lines dance around with the sound it was so bad i thought it was in individual damaged dvd , until i read other reviews here and on imdb
i unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time this was the best of them the others were pure wastes of money while this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point if you 've seen what the bleep dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds
wow ! practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and woo woo sounding phrases , change your voice , and you , too , can be a channeler ! for money ! i'm definitely in the wrong occupation has anybody ever thought to question ramtha on a few specifics that a 35 , 000 year old being from atlantis should know \? did ramtha 's ancient society speak indian accented english \? what an amazing stroke of luck ! what did ramtha 's people do for agriculture and diet , how was his her society structured , what tools did they use , and where was atlantis precisely located \? i'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia or how many years precisely , and in what reckoning \? could ramtha show us some writing samples in atlantean script \? linguists could help here or is it just possible that jz knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we want and need to believe \? is n't that a more realistic explanation \? what does that say about those who buy into this \?
even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the true story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess \( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character \)
this is the worst workout tape that i have ever purchase , the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do i am personally gonna smash my copy of it only reason i gave it 1 star is because the ratings dont go lower
maybe because i did n't like porco everything was sub par for me animation is definitely not as good as his later movies not enough weirdness , tried too much for the plot everything was just too ho hum as if he tried to carry the whole movie on porco 's shoulders but once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and porco was a pig there was n't anything else there
i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police aspect and less on the science , which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle
this was not very good , in my opinion the ring scared the bejeezus outta me this was not scary two weeks afterwards , i still find my mind wandering about one thing why the heck did n't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room \? if i walk into my house and see a half naked boy meowing and hissing at me , i'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief , i had a very hard time doing so with this movie this movie was just plain stupid they should have kept this film story in the states once everything moves over to tokyo , the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i have n't seen in a long time i would have respected the film 1 , 000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan
i'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon , due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it , and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all , this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back
many of these shorts on this dvd \( as well as the other dvd 's in this series \) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these dvd 's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you 'll see on the cartoons
this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25 postitive and 75 negative
considering the sensational cast \( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy and brock peters \) , the euro western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot , ace high is a major disappointment the plot is uninvolving and incoherent , the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style , the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife after the first ten minutes , i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it a boring 120 minute piece of junk , ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series save your fistful of dollars for a better film
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of martha
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been material for vh1 's the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film , television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple , and when she does have more than 3 lines at once , the complete lack of feeling , expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile , like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang nails that is all i can say , i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again

normally i love documentaries i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all however , outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
con express has lots of action in it , which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately , the action is n't enough , and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs , the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality , so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this , i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is , for the most part , pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted , but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over the top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , and speed if you liked those , you probably wo n't mind this one too much just go easy on it
i was trying to think of the best short description of what this is sure it 's a propaganda film but that does n't mean much to most people however , most people have seen attack ads around election time that 's what this is , a very long political attack ad , full of all the things we commonly see in such ads distortions , sarcasm , scary close ups , mood music , mocking tone , glaring omissions , out of context quotes , etc
the dvd for the golden coach is for the most part fine , but the final minutes , which are crucial to the full impact of the film , are ruined by deplorable mastering the scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening i believe criterion made some kind of mastering error , because martin scorsese 's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film criterion should withdraw the dvd and offer a replacement
i was very disappointed with steve's performance eventhough it took a lot out of him to refrain from swearing , his material towards the end of the show began to dwindle to the point that it just became plain ignorant , especially in the part where he was expressing how he would kill someone , etc , and gloating bout it after i bought it , i later caught it on a cable network god may not be through with him yet , but it will be up to him \( steve \) to repent on his own this may be good humor for a more complacent christian audience
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time but now it is over , definitely i disliked this novel , and the movie is obnoxious rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently , in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one \( why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies \? \)
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not , having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much touted play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , is colossal torture , like status elipticus it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up , that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums do n't take my word for it , watch it yourself and see
susan ward , coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv , gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures , it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward , then give this a movie a try , if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future , don t find it here
i ordered these , and several other movies from the tyler perry collection , only to find that they were not actual movies but on stage plays i returned them and was charged a high restocking fee not ok ! no where in the description was mention of them being stage plays i will order my cd 's and dvd 's from another source in the future
this is a pure rip off from the cover of aerosmith 's live bootleg album from 1978 where 's the shame \? too bad twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover
shame on talented actors like maura tierney and jerry orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it star co writer john romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time , and this is his only film , and i can see why he plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by tierney , who also works in a local factory run by orbach dennis christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator and june lockhart and lyle waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as tierney 's estranged parents the movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it 's so shoddily included , it makes no statement at all
cesar milan , the so called 'dog whisperer' , bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status , and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it
i agree , these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason , they are not that good ok , there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying i love charlie murphy and the ashy guy and i think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny dave , come back to tv
the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects , making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs , on which the sound is perfect , so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd
this review is more about the superbit transfer of the movie to dvd than the movie itself the movie itself is great and i highly recommend it
i got nothing to say was this supposed to be intense \? was this supposed to be a thriller \? it was boring horrible acting , except for forest whitaker but even he could n't save this one pure fincher \? pure trash horrible , horrible , horrible quite possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i am just too upset to type , i ca n't believe i actually waisted my time with this
terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue , it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid
the film deserves 5 stars but the dvd only gets 1 why no letterbox format after waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on dvd , why would they give us full screen pan scan \? yes , the quality and color are great but oh , what we 're missing on the sidelines
many people had reccomended this movie to me but it failed to live up to its reputation the quality of the film making was aweful , the acting bad to the point of utter ridiculousness , and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers it gets some credit toward the end for showing some self awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was there were some cute moments , and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big l word ladies , but do n't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product
i love leslie nielsen , but this movie is not funny his better movies are wrongfully accused and the naked gun movies
the hospital as well crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean spirited one i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's network and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness i'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole if george c scott 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding , drinking , or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant \? diana rigg is completely wasted in this film her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini skirt and be ravaged by scott 's character the film is also not helped by the lead footed direction of arthur hiller the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years ago thanks to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family , each of whom is brilliantly cast i have series 3 4 and now want 1 2 do n't wait any longer , 24 episodes of absolute delight await you
betty hutton has a colossal amount of energy she seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining she 's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers her voice is sturdy , durable , indestructible
i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob , the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense , few laughs , and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more
michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great b movies as this , q , and it 's alive 3 island of the alive how awesome is he \? \? anyways , i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously , thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you should n't because not only is this a b movie , but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that \? \? i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie , just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth , do n't be too critical on it
i love jeff goldblum , but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck ! \) and the ridiculous , lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) , the storyline , and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better
i am a big fan of frank miller 's work and i loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from when i saw this film i was blown away by the visuals it had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything i had seen in a movie before
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book i'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning , that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny , not scary , and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns , do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit , but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this , i dont even know why you are considering the film
i read some good reviews about this movie in adition , i respect french 's cinema , they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies so , i bought spanish apartment
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school they also discover that they have been cheating on one another the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters i would have expected better from these two
for several reasons apparently , the other online reviewers are extremely over analytical in their critiques of this film the dvd 's jacket has a quote from rolling stone think 'sex and the city' with men ! well , i say , think again as an avid watcher of sex and the city , this film has little if any comparison to satc firstly , this film is not a comedy there were very small instances when i kind of chuckled , but could barely muster a real laugh actually , towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that i kept hitting fast forward on the remote \( those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what i mean here ! \) the characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person 's life these disjointed glimpses do n't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters yes , they are all bored whether they are in their 30 's or their 50 's yes , they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs i usually enjoy movies with this breaking away from boredom type of plot for example pane e tulipani \( bread and tulips \) , facing windows \( also starring giovanna mezzogiorno and a much better film \) , under the tuscan sun , shirley valentine , a month by the lake , etc the last kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do , however the viewer is left with no warm feelings about life 's decisions , only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film
i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004 i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie , but it was really lackluster
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius , he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro , awesome ! hoffman , awesome ! streisand , awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless , and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie , these a 1 actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film , and i recommend it to every and anyone to see , but wear your depends , because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya 99 , you do n't know what in the friggin' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an anti social loser , that complains about going out to the movies \? stay home , i'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
this truly is a horrible movie 7 seconds , huh , yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it the acting is horrible , the plot is horrible , the filming is horrible everything is horrible ! i was hopeful because of snipes , which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie ! snipes could n't even do the fight scenes and make them look real the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love ! huh , they were a romantic interest \? they hinted at it , but never showed this happening
i loved the original movie , and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome wrong wrong wrong ! ! first of all , the child actors were horrible , well the charlie and mike characters were ok , but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp \? he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater , and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
the books are witty and charming this , in stark contrast , is formulaic schlock americans and much of the world 's consumers prefer their entertainment predigested so it does n't require chewing , so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly
when i purchased this dvd , i was hoping to get the complete picture an unbiased presentation from scratch i could sense what was to come bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this dvd it is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted what little was discussed appeared to be very tainted
though i'm still a big south park fan , i do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons this season has its standouts , most notably the truly demented christmas critters episode , but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes
i hear this is a good movie , but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged so what about quality control \? this disc should never have gotten out the door , but the odd thing is , i ordered 2 dvd 's from amazon different titles , both damaged are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us \? f
i usually trust amazon reviewers on movie reviews , but this time no way ! this silly , totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment , hoping the movie would liven up sadly , it did n't to those who rave about the film you must be in another dimension or something thumbs down
i liked the shows when the 1st ran on tv the unrated did n't quite live up to my expectations
another product of hollywood 's karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind , we have in u 571 an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war , we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting , camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies \( german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors \) and absurd scenarios \( an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit \) put this ridiculous movie in its own category u 571 is just another thin , over promoted , throw away movie you 'll forget the day after you see it
sat down and saw this one on televion
sure , this movie is a classic but is it any good \? frankly , i found it to be tedious in the extreme
not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special , but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which anti homosexual groups been touting for years if you 're thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship , do n't the lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end
the shows themselves are wonderful , but the people who put together this dvd set should be ashamed of this paltry effort ! there are no cast or staff interviews about the ending of such a wonderful series no commentaries no english sub titles no john spencer honorarium of any kind they did n't even take the time to include the 1 hour re showing of the original pilot they aired before the finale ! the only extras are two not special at all special features dealing with the debate this dvd set is definately not worth the money to buy it brand new
unfortunately this ms collection is not compatible with european dvd players the cover of the dvd actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the us and canada' save yourself a lot of trouble and do n't buy this if you are from the eu !
cheesy instructor
i have always like denise austin , however this was tape was way too fast for a beginner i thought it was for beginner and on up denise went way to fast and she did not explain the poses at all i will not be using this tape i was disappointed because normally i love her videotapes and her
i hated this movie so unrealistic sure , maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating but i am a teenager in a city nobody acts like this !
margarett mitchell must be rolling in her grave she wrote a masterpiece in the 1930 's , then alexandra ripley bought the rights to her book by conning margaret mitchell 's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative alexandra ripley 's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush , even worse than a barbara courtland romance novel
i 've loved this movie ever since i saw it on cbs years ago so i was really excited to own it on dvd unfortunately the experience was ruined when i discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene i was very dissapointed
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)
the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened do n't even buy it , it is a waist of your money
whatever ills are in the world , it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one sided and totally non objective movie for example , instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work , they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and , if they chose that job freely , it must be their best option , no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise , as opportunities increase over time \( by having more corporations and not less , to create more competition for these people 's labor \) , and as the country becomes wealthier , these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact , the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where anti child labor laws , at the urging of the un , turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs , as sad as it may be , were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process , but all the industrialized nations went through that process government mandated shortcuts usually produce results which are even worse however , the results speak for themselves in very short period of time , for example , hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china , india and around the world thanks for the evil capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also , cost of living is very low there , so these pennies really can go a long way , do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people \? i guess to let people starve to death , then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! \? other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes , and may act like a separate being as far the law in concerned , but does a corporation have a nose , feet , stomach \? can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis \? of course , not , than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it \? \? several of the main spokepersons in the movie , chomsky , michael moore , rifkin and others are renowned for their off the wall comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie , you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie , you 're basically bombarded by one sided arguments with very little of the other side presented , despite the director 's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1 2 1 2 , it 's more like 80 20 \) just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid , they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes \( hey , let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! \) , dvd players , or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need \? chomsky , of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want , according to him he says that you should do more important things , like perhaps studying lingistics \( which he teaches but which very few care about \) the movie does make some correct and good observations , especially regarding polution , however , i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess , just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie , it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples , how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the u s government do so many things for private companies with public funds \? just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies , forbid government corporate welfare of any kind , forbid subsidies to companies , cut the suffocating red tape and regulation \( esp in developing countries but in the west too \) , cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 \( and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing , give people all around the world a better life , increase competition , etc \) if these and other governments \( and not corporations' \) problems were eliminated , the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile \( spoken about with much admiration \) , people with no understanding about economics , how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it the dvd we just purchased was horrible they chopped out so much of the movie it made it un watchable it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
she 's built like a 12 year old boy give me vida guerra anyday
i was thrilled when i first read that mlb productions was finally issuing a dvd version of highlights of the baltimore orioles' three world series victories i already owned the vhs versions , one of which \( the 1970 world series \) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization \( watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film \) finally , i could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 world series
the movie directors in the me , particularly iranians , are responding to demands by the west for certain type of movies they produce what is demanded from them in turn , they receive awards cultural industry empowers these demands they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded there is no single me movie which depict the story of western imperialism in the me and then awarded for doing so me movies must show that me women are in need of emancipation me cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized civilization itself is presented in vertical sense there is a civilization somewhere out there all measterners are expected to reach yet , it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them \( no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country who deprived them of education and knowledge the west is represented by beautiful , blonde nurses , a nice american guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his everyday western knowledge of medicine in the midst of total ignorance , and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs such a nice way to civilize ! \)
in the film commentary , director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying , 'i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it ' \( that 's a paraphrase \) and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad the director did n't know what it was about
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces , but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased , and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information pre 9 11 and post 9 11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond , we are truly in trouble the truth is out there , and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd , but this dvd is maybe worth a glance , but not a long hard look
this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing , the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny , and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee , another movie with a fast talking , potty mouthed , black guy \( hello eddie murphy \) who , because it 's perfectly fine in ultra lib , pc hollyweird , calls charlie sheen \( and everyone else who is not black \) a host of nasty , racially oriented names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist \( tucker \) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop killer , is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a co star , but like most of his other movies , he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter hey bob , what will we have tucker do next \? hey i know , let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names second screenwriter hey , great idea fred , i sure do n't have any ideas apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip off of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor , i pity you
this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly , painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses
i have only one question about this movie and that is , why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book \?
first of all , 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks second of all , i missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain also , regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises , it is still moderately difficult
saw this as an inflight movie boy , did i pray for engine trouble , so we 'd have to land and i could get away ! sucks or what \? i liked smith in 'i , robot' , 'independence day' , etc , but this was awful it 's a one joke movie problem is , the one joke was the one plastered all over the tv spots and trailers \( the jet ski incident \) the highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool wish that 'd been the main storyline instead far , far superior ! will not be adding this to my wishlist
i cannot get thru this one i started fast forwarding but there did n't appear to have any good spots when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this , i thought , this has to be good i had just finished a movie where he starred ca n't remember the name of it i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it tori spelling is well known , but not to me someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start she does not play a flake very well , and i do n't know what to call her except a flake i stopped this dvd in about the first 1 2 hour and will go back and give it another shot , but with tori spelling as one of the leads , i already know this one does not have a prayer i would say save your money on this one unless you are under 13 i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that do n't this one falls into this category one that came with this one was the broken hearts club and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage
the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus , everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something
wow it 's rare i consider a movie absolutely horrendous , but this one qualifies we are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy , and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie , i found myself yelling die already when he does n't kill himself in the end , all i wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him a dumb stupid awful indie movie that is a waste of film , time and effort
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly , his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with ice t mcginly 's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world , he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast \( which included hacks like paul rudd \) was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and ice t who have graced some of his previous work please sean , stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff , leave that to idiots like capra , wenders , scorcese etc they are not in your league
i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good
saw the previews of the first movie , but i was n't expecting too much from that i tried to finish both the first and the second , but that did n't work out too well i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie , and that includes the first all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this a has been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer , down on his luck the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property , and hides his car trying to escape a finance co the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine in one early scene they have a funeral , casket and all , for a monkey yuk
i just opened a box with a cesar millan book and this dvd imagine my surprise i do n't like the pairing of this book with cesar 's stuff either ! now i have an extra errand and cost to ship back if anything like this ever happens again , there are other sites to order from online i do n't want it to be too much work to browse and study the copy i feel a bit cheated
director gary fleder
what is the deal cant hollywood leave well enough alone how many classic animated movies are they going to ruin with sequels \? let me think , their was balto 2 , little mermaid 2 , aladdin 2 and three , secret of nimh 2 , land before time 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 etc enough already next thing you know they 'll be making a lion king 2 , and a buity and the beast 2 o wait , they already did that did n't they all the movies i have named were great originals but god awful sequels adgth 2 is just as bad if you loved the original , stay away from its sequal
this movie is one of cinema history 's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success saturday night fever from a few years before is another example , but that movie could actually stand on its own jennifer beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside , i do n't think this one could
believe it or not , i actually wanted to watch this movie i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then
this is a remake of an affair to remember with cary grant and deborah and it does not work some movies just should not be remade the only thing good about this movie is katharine hepburn 's appearance get the original
first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan therefore , i tried to like this really , i did
talentless people and garbage music torture you in this turkey in no time flat , you 'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! out into the yard do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense
man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs old , but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book i'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning , that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
i went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of northern america having only really seen pocahontas through the eyes of disney , i felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events
the new world is the least of terrence malick 's limited filmography to date , and could be best described as a monotone poem it 's not exactly bad , just mundane and rather forgettable even while you 're watching it , more of a self indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired , while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s p o k e n v e r y s l o w l y i n h u s h e d t o n e s against selections from his classical music collection , which does n't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific colin farrell , a nice enough lad offscreen i'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he 's given true to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions the bambi caught in the headlights of an oncoming car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he 's not been getting enough roughage in his diet the fact that he 's outshone by q'orianka kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy , although to be fair he has been worse indeed , among the male leads christian bale does much , much more with much , much less in the last third of the film , as does a typically underused christopher plummer in the first third
me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films and we do really like the thin red line but this was a real boring piece of film making the whole film was just one huge poetry reading and i prefer to read poetry from a book it just does n't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by george lucas even the battle scenes were just poetry readings watch thin red line instead if you are interested in this director 's work that film is a masterpiece this is n't
this movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of christian bale and colin farrell to date it was boring , overblown and incessantly long it 's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better , but it never does and then it just ends do n't waste the time or the money
off hand , i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey , he 's making a buck , here \) that 's all 1 32 star , if possible
i never received product as they never shipped it amazon sent me an email stating that they could n't complete my order as it was non deliverable not sure what that means if every other item i purchase is deliverable
this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version
before i review , i 'd like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim , ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show , and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie , which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name , \( which i have not read , so i do n't know which is more accurate \) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way
it 's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film how could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy \? if this film is considered groundbreaking then i fear for our republic
am i the only one who found the basic workout difficult \? the pace was too quick for me to get the right technique in the poses and even though i have done this workout several times now , my back almost always is very painful for at least 24 hours afterward i have found that , apart from a few exercises , the intermediate workout is easier
i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmira \( the camp in elmira , n y , the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate \)
i gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore , but choose not to one the other hand , rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone
therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain
stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic not one single fact about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film i had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won what a crock
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his her dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his her mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich \? do we wait until then to change the moral \? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music , making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me , god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !
who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm \? chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too , although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies \? they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters this movie was somewhat good , but it did n't feel all that great so far , this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra , the incredible hulk , xmen 3 , daredevil , and the punisher i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies , but after seeing what hollywood does to them , i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding special effects were good in this movie , and so was the story michael chiklis as the thing was great , and his the thing character makeup was done very well , and he played the character well too , as did ioan gruffud with mr fantastic jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie
the central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920 's robin hood and his band of gangsters unfortunately , even the rat pack cannot save this movie the script is slow , dated , and dull barbara rush 's scenes are especially confusing her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie nothing comes of her apparent interest in sinatra or martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut the main actors seemed to be bored , and with the exceptions of bing crosby and peter falk , walked through their performances \( maybe they were hung over most of the time \? \)
well folks , looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here \( crash comes close , but that film has a lot more detractors than this one , and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined , somehow , that it would change the world \) my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse , nor do i find it overly depressing fact is , it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying , sometimes at different moments , sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film , against my better judgement still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend a streetcar named desire , kids , last exit to brooklyn , and traffic
the only reason why i saw this was because of susannah york this shows she was more capable of the dix she played in the killing of sister george and was a fine actress otherwise this movie is blah it 's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting the men in this movie are so disgusting one ca n't blame her for getting mad anyway for another pointless film of this caliber see secret ceremony
he thought the columbine incident was about gun control it was not it was about anger and bullying that is the problem that is what would have fixed that problem we need to help children be better to eachother or problems like this will keep going on it is worth seeing because it is interesting , but he is wrong on this one micahel moore is a good director but people are not always right
you want realism of the old west \? try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they did n't have tissues try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair , and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste , so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black
ok , the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long \? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters
i hate lawyers
okay , the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen , but i like the actors \( especially ben 's best man \) so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot , such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones \? or at least , why do n't they use them \? oh no , much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee , he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up \? and uh , they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gonna get busted \?
simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin \( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince \( why \? \) \) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so , a kid dies , which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around , why , no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship
i rented this dvd because of the glowing reviews here and because i wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the middle east overall , i was disappointed by this offering because it did n't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject \( it also seems to me to be a bit biased in israel 's favor vis a vis the palestinians , but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately \)
other reviews rant about ms judd frankly , after double jeopardy and high crimes , i'm not seeing the superb actress , but that 's aside the point this movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else search for truth , not innocence especially if you are an attorney
ashley judd 's \( normal life , the locusts \) husband , played by jim caviezel \( the passion of the christ , frequency \) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in el salvador a bunch of years ago so , judd hires the always superb morgan freeman \( unleashed , million dollar baby \) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment judd then has threats on her life after the opening sequence pulls you in , the thrills are a mixed bag \( car crash scene for example was good \) and the outcome , well , i really saw coming anyway ashley judd 's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband \( double jeopardy \) twisted and kiss the girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin also starring bruce davison \( x men , dahmer \) , amanda peet \( the whole nine yards , the whole ten yards \) and tom bower \( die hard 2
funny and very inspirational good way to encourage young teenagers to build self esteem if there 's a will , there 's a way anyone can dance
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film , against my better judgement still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend a streetcar named desire , kids , last exit to brooklyn , and traffic
ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film
these plays were okay , i'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice , the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre \( definitely no tyler perry quality on that note \) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he did n't
in good company goes on and on at the end a little bit , and the ending especially is not fulfilling character plot wise if it had ended 15 20 minutes before it actually did , i would give it three stars instead of two
i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring , i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever rea
the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far fetched , it is actually completely false the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered \( or is otherwise the victim \) , but what you did , in distinct criminal incidents even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone , if you go back and murder them again then that is a new incident , and double jeopardy does not apply
this show deserved to get cancelled , and there 's a very simple reason this is supposedly dry , subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry , subtle comedy it 's a show that was presented to the fox audience , an audeince that normally likes the most inane , low brow kind of humor , that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it
four brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story , reeking of artificiality , features mark wahlberg , tyrese gibson , andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery , the quartet launches into action , seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced , through their investigation in the neighborhood , that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe
i do not understand what the hype about this dvd is i baught it according to reviews , but unfortunatly , was very dissapointed i def felt a burn in my upper abs , but you are laying on your back the entire time there is no changing positions and targeting the abs from diferent angles to me , it was basically crunch after crunch after crunch would not recommend it unless you want buldge in your upper abs
while i 've been a big fan of ghost in the shell , these stories are the worst yet \( i 've watched the first three episodes on cartoon network as the dvd is not out yet \)
personally , i found this workout extremely difficult to follow the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand , i grew frustrated other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition , as i have obviously tried , but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill , both of which i believe are integral to any workout and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output one should n't have to teach themselves the moves
thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low budget
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes , then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what 's up with that
the movie title itself says a lot , the movie itself is a total scam , fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing , script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie
strengths soundtrack by christopher franke , performance by andreas katsulas in 1st half interesting idea of weapons system
denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults this video is n't kid friendly , and does n't have a good feel for kids to be honest , it is very close to most of denise 's exercise videos for adults what denise has forgotten , or may have never known , is kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly , and that means with exercise videos to
sixth sense unbreakable are so much better than signs , and i'm sorry to say whatever m night shyamalan originally had , he 's lost when sixth sense came out , he was tipped as the next big thing , but i'm sorry to say , it 's no longer there in my mind , he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of sixth sense
i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a middle aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life , so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor , a crush is pursued , a wife gets jealous , hires a detective , and gasp his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie , just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual , which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end , besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance never had contestants who mastered it
i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored , i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking , and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said , oh , it was okay but did n't elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny , with jokes or punchlines that fell flat , horrible acting , totally predictable , and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you 're really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then , you 'd be better off to go home empty handed there 's not even much eye candy to recommend , which is a nice fallback if there 's nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling just because you like a movie should n't mean you give it 5 stars , especially when it 's as bad as this one i mean , i liked freddy vs jason , but there 's no way i 'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars this is bottom of the barrel
as an environmental scientist , i find these soft science hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful while they rally the convinced , having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful to wit , about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage
dull , dull , dull
\( it is really random the selection they used as you hardly have a great cage match in every choice and for the millionth time that wwe lies to us , snuka backlund was not 1980 ! it was june 28 , 1982 ! the date they claim from 1980 was backlund patera in a texas death match a company with that much money has no excuse for such a continous screw up ! snuka was not working for vince sr in 1980 , he was in the nwa feuding with ric flair as part of gene anderson 's stable ! \)
being a fan of cesar , i expected something new and informative
the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow , tepid , and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie , i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great \( i 'll try and remember that next time \) the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward , you 'll know what i mean when it happens , the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere , very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it , happy viewing
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently , i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought , ok , i did n't see the whole thing , it might have gotten better , so i 'll give it another chance bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what \? that 's about as boring as this movie so why the 1 star markup \? cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen , of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the rings and i do like viggo i did not , however , like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried , never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap , watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time
i have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the kids channels i was hoping the dvd would show each of his songs as they are performed on tv instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons this would have been a better cd instead of a dv
it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame
susan ward , coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv , gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures , it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward , then give this a movie a try , if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future , don t find it here
i was really looking forward to this , i 've seen cheap trick live , and they really put on a good show i do n't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio it is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse muffled audio , and underpowered vocals i have a 5 1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert dvd that i 've ever heard i'm giving it 2 stars because i think it was a good show to see live \( if you were there \) , but the audio quality \( or lack of it \) ruined it for me
let me start off by saying that i have higher degrees in art , art history , music , and romance languages so i am an admitted art snob having said that , i would recommend that you try the baby einstein baby van gogh , world of colors and baby mozart videos instead of this brainy baby video
the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
my friend bought this set and so i was able to view it before purchasing it myself , and i won't be purchasing it i had seen the long , long trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies i have ever seen one of those films where you ca n't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do we enjoy most of the i love lucy series , but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows the aggrivating ones , and this film was just an overly long aggrivating i love lucy episode there is funny humor and aggrivating humor and this was definitely the 2nd type
i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too to this day , i pray i do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average mexican american again as a mexican american who has worked hard to take the right road in life , i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race \? prison sex \? babies drinking beer \? young kids doing a drive by \? mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa \? please ! ! ! ! wake up mexicans americans ! we need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message what message \? that doing the things shown in this movie are bad \? i think we knew that already ! what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made , it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful p s let us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual \( s \) out there who found the movie offensive edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie adios amigos ! ! !
i watched about fifeteen minutes before i got enough it was so un biblical it was insulting besides that , it 's a bore
maybe it 's just me , but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production \( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film \) , with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker , but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest , either \( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie \) if you are an alan rickman fan , chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly , alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned , the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star \? sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood , killing , and the like it was totally historically inaccurate , and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow , without even aiming the canon , he knocks his 'friend' off his horse

this straight to video 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison , this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion however , leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off , \( though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around \) , and there 's a torture scene , \( modeled on the one in lethal weapon \) , in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell
pinocchio 24 50
and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake the narritor 's voice was monotone i wanted to shout at his pompous , snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples with the narritor , granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko when you take people on a educating journey \( such as nine hours long \) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying check please
i was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between the gospel and the fighting temptations i would not recommend purchasing you are better off renting
i 've been waiting for this season , literally , for years it contained \( notice the past tense \) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show it was in the emergency clinic in the episode my sister , my sitter where the scene pans around showing the patients smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down when i first saw that , many years ago , i literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like i needed a padded room she did n't even understand the joke when i explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of hiding the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable this dvd cut has been cut and makes smithers reply about not letting lisa ahead of him make no sense one of my favorite things about the simpsons was that they did n't care who they offended well they went pc and now i'm highly offended ! if they had n't messed with it i would give them 5 stars , or more realistically i would n't have bothered to write this review quit tampering with the show , fox ! !
please think this dvd is recorded in 1986 more worse , this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of company \( same , worst sound quality documentary \) , i suspect the word concert or soundtrack in dvd title
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of martha
dull , dull , dull
how high is a film that lends nothing , i repeat , nothing to the film community at large i have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the cheech chong of the new millennium with the redman method man pairing while most seem to agree that this is a horrible film , very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be when i use the word racist , i mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich s that african americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society while there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring , what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing method man and redman must be to both the film community , but also to their own culture i have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films , but this one left my jaw on the floor several times the blatant swings at african american stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director jesse dylan , but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film nothing was original nothing was exciting
i'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia i had not seen this movie as a child those that say it 's faithful to the book must have read something other than lewis carroll 's alice however , the kitsch value is considerable cheezy music and costumes , pure 1985 that being said , the jabberwock was pretty cool in that godzilla man in the rubber suit sort of way also , the set design was very handsome it 's too bad that the lighting technology of the time could n't have been more varied everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional the film that comes closest to tenniel 's original alice illustrations is the 1933 paramount b w version it 's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on turner classics
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which , i guess , is the point
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces , but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased , and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information pre 9 11 and post 9 11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond , we are truly in trouble the truth is out there , and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd , but this dvd is maybe worth a glance , but not a long hard look
a tribute is defined as a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude , respect , or admiration that is what you have here
well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy or out of the ordinary or made by that great director its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless
having been a teenager once , i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however , in pump up the volume , the movie 's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero \( well played by christian slater \) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth , he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he does n't use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim , he treats the caller as someone who is n't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure , but is n't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise \? the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry , folks , been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives , as none of these teens do , merely escalates the generational gap , and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
roger ebert , a review i greatly respect and normally agree with , raved about this flick roger , i love you , but you missed the boat on this one
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant it was n't a bad movie it simply was n't a good one boooooooring zzzz zzzz zzz
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives , it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
i never saw this movie until i was 16 the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments , well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now
did nicholson read the script before signing for this movie \? was he broke that he had to act \? has he reached senility to accept to play in such a poor scenario \?
i turned it off after 20 minutes
if they 're releasing 2 volumes per season , does n't that mean that there will be 18 sets since the show was on 9 years \? at 35 a volume that 's over 600 00 !
i do n't know how this skunk got 4 and 1 2 stars on amazon let alone one ! i could hear hepburn , bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford 's linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that , while the original sabrina was about her transformation , this version was about linus' transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end there was a merger , and you were in the way no hard feelings is very cold compared with bogart 's would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it \? in the original , you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you do n't get that here at all
for what purpose these lies about the life of this man \? are the liberal film makers racists who do n't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie \? if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man
not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes , it 's tantamount to watching old batman episodes as soon as something develops , in comes the cheesy music
the movie is one of my favorites , works on both a romantic level , and a comic level but where 's the widescreen \? todays consumers are more educated \( thank god \) and they 've almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen , you lose the top and bottom of the movie \? ! they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd \? it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who 's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it \? buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible
this movie was obviously made by japanese fans of several american films it then tried to mix them all together in one film
hart's war had potential the last months of world war two as a backdrop with demoralized gi 's crammed into an overcrowded pow compound if this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the battle of the bulge , then it could have had a chance instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny , not scary , and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns , do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we 've seen in films like baby boy almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word he did n't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance i do n't know what this film was about there are parts where there is a long silence with no talking the whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house
how anyone could rate this movie 4 5 stars is beyond belief this was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere as i watched this movie i could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama it was never very funny and both lead actors , playing one white and one adopted black brother , had scenes in the movie that were terrible romany malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body he jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings , runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them , in his drawers \? he is talentless and idiotic as a brother in france that no one can relate to paul rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and grossly tells off everyone people he has known for less than a week ! the servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well but ca n't make up for the dismal rest ludicrous a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama this is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints
the movie dead life by director william victor shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as night of the living dead or at least it tries to be unfortunately it 's a stupid attempt and being original through looking old , which in itself is an irony
okay i admit , they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends heres my problem , they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera , most of the scenes were blurry , every now and again the focus was clear , i mean c'mon , when i was fourteen i made a short stop motion animation film using an old bell and howell super 8 cam and even then i paid attention to the focusing okay enough of that , now for the pros of the film the make up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most men wince , the outdoor and some indoor settings had a notld feel overall i recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds , at least you can say you saw it rent if you can , if not , buy used
for years , i 've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low budget horror movies , but i 'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is dead life do n't be fooled when i say this movie is shot on film it seriously looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera it 's perpetually grainy , dark , fuzzy , and shaky , and not in an artsy way my 200 video camera looks infinitely better than this the video quality is appropriate , however , as it 's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink fest the sound is murky and undecipherable , the acting is strictly amateur hour , the characters are paper thin with no distinction or purpose , the story is non existent , the dialogue is a completely worthless bore , there 's nothing remotely scary , and the special effects \( including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a commodore 64 \) are laughable or , at least , i wish they were laughable that would 've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this \( high school \) student film it 's movies like this cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy , but which get cherry spots on blockbuster shelves because they 're packaged with slick cover art that give horror movies in general \( and zombie movies in particular \) a bad name , and that make horror fans so wary disgraceful !
unfocused , repetitive , and worst of all boring ! what should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame ronnie earle , the district attorney at the center of the film , says , this is n't about democrats and republicans , this is about cops and robbers if only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say instead , from the start , the big buy feels like a film you 've walked into thirty minutes late following the theme stated by earle of cops and robbers , the big buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic , but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely wo n't notice somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story , to bad it 's not being told here
with the exception of disc 6 this collection was very disappointing it was obvious that the show lost its charm after season 3 and was well on its way out before paul reubens little incident however , if you liked pee wee herman the first collection under playhouse 1 is excellent it was fresh and innovative my 3 year old loves the first 6 discs disc 7 to disc 10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase they should have included disc 6 with the first set anything after that was simply not entertaining the quality of all the discs still is excellent
leeches is a terrible movie dude , i have never seen anything so gay in my whole life \( except the director 's other film speed demon \) when the guys were less clothes than the gals , thats not a good sign the video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director 's work
the o c has got to be one of the most overrated , overhyped , shows that i have ever seen , this side of friends this show makes me ashamed to be from socal their is nothing appealing or compelling about a bunch of rich , spoiled , suburban , white teens \( sorry , i mean 24 , 25 , 28 year old acters playing teenagers \) and their so called problems i admit , i tried to give this show a chance , i tried to watch a few episodes , and really , i could n't make it passed the half an hour mark w out turning it to adult swim or some nick at night re run or something and speaking of white , is o c suppose to stand for orange county or only caucasians i had no idea , that their were no black , mexican , or asian people that lived in the o c peter gallagher 's character is suppose to be the bad guy huh \? please ! how about i snatch this chump off the o c streets , toss him in a trunk and take him to long beach , compton , crenshaw , or watts and then lets see how bad a guy he is then the bottom line is , i ca n't stand this gay , fake show and i ca n't stand all you losers that praise it even more ! and by the way , this show do n't even belong in the same zip code as b h 90210 ! now put that in yo pipes and smoke it !
i expected alot more from richard harris he was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of abraham also , there was n't enough vocal input from god , expecially since his promises to abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant there were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible i was somewhat annoyed that the movie had god saying that sarai 's name means princess and that he would change it to sarah which means queen this is not true ! ! in hebrew sarah means princess such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability
in dr yang 's dvd i expected to find a good reference for my practice of the yang 108 form , but i am very displeased with the quality of the dvd for the price that i paid , i expected a least good video quality when dr yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor there are close ups of the upper body and obviously , the movement of the legs is not seen you get lost with changes of camera angles at some point , you can see people in the background and the stage is not properly set up also , and with all due respect , his movements are weird i have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed definitively i do not recommend this dvd to any one who wants to use it as a reference , you can use it as a movie
i have been a long time radiohead fan and , like many others , have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old !
the original candyman sucks so bad , but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself , am i missing something \? so , i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it , so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series well , after watching candyman 2 , one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish again , the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme the villain in candyman makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary if you want a good laugh , watch the candyman series , but if you want to be scared , you would even do better to watch ren and stimpy in all seriousness , watch halloween and halloween ii if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and does n't try to send a social message lol some people call candyman 2 farewell to the flesh a horror movie i just call it rubbish
love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
my son loves airplanes and jets ! i bought this dvd based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video if you want a dvd that shows airplanes jets flying , do not buy this dvd ! the name of the video should be , watch the blue angles get ready to fly , because that is what this video is in the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying then the next 25 minutes is no flying just talking and showing the blue angles getting ready for their show in the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show my son has never made it to that point he wants to see airplanes jets fly and i'm now on a new search for a dvd that will do this for him

1 make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something
well i went to the concert and the whole time while i was watching it , i was glade they where coming out with a dvd because dvd can hold lots and lots and lots of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why i would be 100 i do n't care i want to see it all and well i waited months and months , wondering waiting for it to come out , i went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time then it was time the p t dvd of the century thank you emi for destroying a historial document so you can get all your signed contracts on to your dvd well now all i have to do is use my time machine and get a tape ready and tape the damn concert wait time machines doe n't exist well now i am going ot have to go underground to get it but wait i still 100 will emi release all the videos on dvd or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it all i can say this is why the internet was invented for information exchange if they keep information paticularly this historical document from people , they will share it over the internet the video does n't belong to 1 company it belongs to the world , the world created this and who does emi think they are by limiting this i am so sick and tired of this utter b t no one should settle for this , i demand more and everyone should demand more also 3 billion people watched 1 million spectaters and what does emi tell you , they will put the crappiest dvd together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website i believe i shall find them all and put them up on wikipedia because it is n't 1 person who owns the worlds creation anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them every extra cent of this dvd should go to africa and it doesnt it and its a bloody shame all i can say is i am making sure this goes on to every review for this damned dvd untill something is done about it
well , i guess i should 've read more reviews of this dvd it is strictly for beginners i do n't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up \( if i do breath of fire it helps \) when i want an easy day i 'll pop this in and do both sessions very simple but i'm sure it 's good for a beginner a beginning beginner sara ivanhoe is soothing though , and encouraging but seriously , this is a very easy workout
there 's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book , but it 's mostly emotional it 's an extremely multi layered novel and the work of a true master the film on the other hand is just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful to look at , with lots of skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice ripping nonsense , etc and next to no substance it has no artistic integrity whatsoever , as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did
the novel of wide sargasso sea was decent book a re writing of jane eyre 's bertha but the film is really hard to tolerate it starts out ok although it seems to start deviating from the book early on past the point where antoinette marries rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too
the lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real edward r murrow , and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the `50s , but otherwise i 'd did n't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short , boring movie that seemed much longer maybe i 've just seen too many biopics lately
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade , with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind , but it was a mess
i was hoping that socermania would be on the extreme sports fun dvd but no ! instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures this also goes for the other two dvd 's extreme music and adventure fun , allthough 'pluto 's blue note' , 'donald 's dilemma' 'no sail' 'old sequoia' and 'trailer horn' are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities and the chronological donald volume 2 \( which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration \) who needs these dvds , so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd 's and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration
film 4 5 stars dvd 0 stars
tyrese gibson , for worst actor ever up to this point , i 've been a huge paul walker fan for his comedically bad acting he 's made a career of it in this one , his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word bro at least 75 times \( to give his character street cred \) , and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops it 's clear walker is deeply considering his plight but really walker ca n't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of tyrese gibson my god where did they find this guy \? the movie would 've been ok as a standard , mindless action film , but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
do n't let the cover fool you , this film is n't half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it 's my own fault , but i was expecting something more like groove , or at least something interesting to watch and it 's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands , i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays , and more from that scene however , this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory , than it did about the music , and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom , but saw it through anyway now i would n't call this bad , it had it 's good parts , just not many
24 hour party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung \( if best in show was not enough \) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the 2nd brit wave , and michael winterbottom could have exposed the goings on in a much better way
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story
all these shows are the syndicated ones there are at least 3 min cut from each show sony sucks big time for releasing edited shows not the first time \( see soap , other seasons of good times \) brought mine back and got a refund
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by 9th gate this film is tepid , there is none of the satanic intensity ambiance that you find in 'rosemary 's baby' it 's too hollywood , surprisingly , considering the maverick presence of depp polanski film opens well , with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence , but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 , which i was equally disappointed in , at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it , but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball , considering he was the producer director co screenwriter , and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible , so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film , rent it only buy angel heart instead
to borrow from a previous reviewer a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering
i am a fan of historical fiction , and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public , who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have , will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history , when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
i 've been a fan of the who since i recieved my copy of tommy on vinyl in 1970 for christmas
what were they thinking \? ! there are actually scenes deleted from the original theatrical release ! ! the extended edition is an abomination if there ever were one
this may be entitled warner bros classic holiday collection , but warner bros had nothing to do with the production or distribution of boys town , men of boys town , or the 1938 christmas carol louis b mayer may return to haunt the christmases of those heretics against the one , true religion of mgm , who purloined spencer tracey , mickey rooney , and ann rutherford to enrich the reputations of harry , jack , abe , and ted
absolutely terrible the most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of dane cook
i think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy i do n't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim , especially about how it 's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character \? but being in a liberal arts college i have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following the characters and the situations remind me of the short stories i would write in the sixth grade when i was around 12 years old , where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb , absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you 're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating , inane nonsense the whole movie feels like ones 12 year old self trying to write about adult problems that they 're distanced from yet infatuated by this movie appeals to the type of people who like to read catcher and the rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain smoking , wannabe depressed but more like i'm so sad 'cause i do n't have a girlfriend indie rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring i think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing , it 's unfortunate he ca n't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic subtle messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say hipster drivel look for something else to watch
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard \( of sports night fame \) was scowling hard , trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said , why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee \?
seriously , i am an expert , and this movie sucks but , imagine for a moment yes , stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound , strikingly engaging , and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals , those `experts' , whose tastes , likes and dislikes , decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all \? besides this interesting question , which is put forth explicitly , without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry , and in about 60 seconds , the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs
the only extraordinary thing about this film is how ow could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it i found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through \( after i dozed off \) do n't be fooled by the other review here they are the true fakes \( if you know what i mean \) save your money and save your time
following live 8 i have to wonder if live aid justifies the euphoria that followed it most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its aims well that 's debatable what it did manage to do was make bob geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name , knighted by the monarchy and very , very rich the same with u2 pushed them into the statosphere and made bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet same with queen pushed them into mega stardom so do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity , push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time sounds pretty good to me one ca n't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money' there was a shot \( deleted of course \) where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving another example of there hyprocrisy madonna singing 'imagine' on her latest tour ' imagine no prosessions yeah right ! i ca n't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that mccartneys version of 'let it be' was stomach churning \? face it the only musician \( peter green ex fleetwood mac \) who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified proves a point
capote , directed by bennett miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace , was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005 it is based on gerald clarke 's 1988 non fiction book capote a biography the film starts by capote 's \( philip seymour hoffman \) interest in the kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime his knowledge of the criminals , especially perry smith \( clifton collins jr \) , which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship the writer is sympathetic and sees in smith a strong resemblance with himself , yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it in cold blood was his most famous novel the one that established him as a legendary writer he was left overwhelmed , confused and unsatisfied , however the movie is quite ambiguous , though characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive at many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations for instance , people are always laughing heartily at what capote has to say , although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter the setting and the music were both barely significant although philip seymour hoffman 's performance is highly remarkable , the actor 's resemblance of capote is questionable hoffman is 5'10 and more stout than the slender , barely 5'2 truman capote
this movie is utterly unremarkable actually , scratch that this movie is actually very remarkable because of how bad it is first of all , the protagonist is pathetic it 's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful , weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems all she does is cry and moan second , the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i 've seen in any movie third , there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered , which disrupt the movie 's flow and continuity for example , the protagonist gets hit head on by an 18 wheeler truck , and her car is absolutely mangled , but she walks away without a scratch someone care to explain how that 's possible \?
i 've been had is all i can say , after reading other reviews i really thought this would be an interesting , exciting movie instead , the story is lame , the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so not scary or at least gripping i watched the whole thing as i thought maybe i am missing something , but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end sorry guys , but this is nowhere near , audition , tale of two sisters or even whispering corridors
if you 've seen tortilla soup , there is no need to watch this movie this is just the chinese version of the said movie the similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both same characters , same plot only in a different setting
this movie is no heathers it 's not even mean girls as hard as it tried to be witty , shocking , dark , and satirical , it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i'm just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless and the craft until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push , i just did n't get it the movie was n't funny \( which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses , carol kane , could n't even elicit a smile out of me \) , the plot was full of holes , and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers , but i was at least hoping for 1 1 2 hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately , the entertainment piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless
my wife and i ejected this dvd after half way through and planned to throw it out i later figured i 'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it the last guy is good and i wo n't throw this away now he does a bit on throwing up that is good most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no , not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids , that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack , a travesty to the nth degree
there are 2 types of people who like black and white films old people and clever clogs know it alls why watch this when you can buy picture perfect with the lovely jennifer aniston for the same price the emperor 's new clothes
rent it but by all means do n't buy it you wo n't watch it more than once this movie is not for those who have invested 25 hours into the tv show although you will better understand what 's going on if you have seen the show , none of this will really seem new or interesting to you you learn some new facts about bob and the man from another place , but nothing important for the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show , adding only pointless and unrealistic new occurances \( bobby kills someone , donna is replaced by an new actor , coop forsees all the future comings of laura 's murder , etc \) all of the twin peaks charm that you have come to love is gone and the movie really suffers from that you ca n't only give coop 10 meaningless lines and expect the show to succeed i think lynch 's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series , focusing on the complications of coop being in the black lodge , harry having an emotional attachment to coop but being forced to bring him down , etc
this is the classic ww2 submarine war movie , and most ww2 submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie i greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action , based on what i read about ww2 submarines the special effects are a bit cheesy , you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships but if you overlook those items , you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of
i hated this movie it is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does stupid plot too many holes and stupid ending
i suppose if you never read the book , you might think this movie is good maybe even charming but having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel , i was so grossly disappointed i ca n't tell you
this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen \? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town \?
dont get me wrong , i'm kinda young but i love 80 's 90 's movies specially the horror ones i had great spectation for early geoge romero movies but both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad gorge romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry , but for today standars they are not , even they are not that good for most of the 80 's 90 's movies
this is by far the worst moive i 've seen i love the first secret garden no one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl it 's a classic but this sequel is terriable it controdicts the first moive it takes the magic away if you liked the origanl , first moive do n't watch this , it will take the magic out of the first moive
the slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy unintelligible at time not what the books are about
if your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of end of the century or filth and the fury this ain't it ! picture taking 40 hours of bad home video \( really awful sound \) and editing together and calling it a documentary no current interviews , no voice over making any sense of the chaos no thought to flow or storyline , just a mishmash of stuff banged together a real dissapointment the saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it , this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance i 've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due its a shame this is what its been reduced to shame on everyone involved
i picked this set up despite reservations \( reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show \) because of the creator j michael straczynski unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible , horrible film mindless , drawn out banter , and weak story line our copy eventually broke \( stepped on \? \) we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star seems like a generous rating
well , i wrote the review about this set , and boy was i disappointed when i got it i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse come on guys , at least try to put some effort into it ! ! ! i got the set , watched it lt and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use what a waste of money ! !
gina is just like the protesters she just does n't get it ! the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it ! whereas africa 's problems including poverty aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down ! as long as more babies are born than people dying , their population goes up very bad the only way to eliminate poverty is less children ! ! send money for that but nothing else
the concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded the girl in the cafe turned out to be a left wing political message i wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character gina \? gina browbeats the members of the g8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world , particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows does the thought ever cross her mind \( or the person writing the script \? \) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of hiv aids , all varieties of venereal disease , children born out of wedlock , etc \? maybe gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly
this should be called the john ford tiny collection , as most of his major films are not included even john ford the early years would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of ford 's work
for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this 0 stars the infamous fake o scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable
trinity collection is a bootleg picture is extremly poor 3 movies for 10 too bad , i like trinity , she 's cute ooops , wrong trinity
this film is definitely not a masterpiece i found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly over rated yes , the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak to make matters worse , the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere perhaps i missed something gigantic because i was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but i would not attempt to see it again however , there were a couple of memorable scenes
i would love to review this lions gate dvd , but i ca n't catch one word in ten it is not , as advertised , closed captioned , and the characters' speech is too casual and british for me to get drat ! i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version
i was not happy with this purchase this video only taught 10 min of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end the teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds , i could have used more teaching and less of a porn show this was a waste of money ! there are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise
i do n't know how i managed to see this gory splatterfest twice in college it 's a terrible movie \( next to that other awful movie wild wild west which also stars salma hayek \)
how could mr cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody \?
when i saw the movie , it was so predictable halfway into it , the broadcasts were so lame as well as the so called live footage total rip off of war of the worlds reminded me
i am pretty easy to please when it comes to movies low budget , high budget , doesn't matter this movie is actually the worst movie i have ever seen in my 45 years of viewing was totally not believable and the writing and directing was shabby at best don't waste your hard earned bucks on this lemon ! ! ! !
into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites having seen the pbs presentation of this , i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction , this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close ups this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play the staging by forcing the viewer 's perspective , this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath
i purchased this movie because i love chris cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive i played the movie yesterday and boy , was i disappointed
this is a horror movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage i do n't mean the acting is garbage , though it is i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage , such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a one man murder wave , then bingo i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat blow away the cast
i generally admire jennifer aniston 's work so i picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn sadly , watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie if you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes , you would't miss much since nothing really happens if it 's a comedy , it is n't funny if it 's a slice of life , the lives are deadly dull the emotional level is so low key you suspect the entire group is on valium jenifer aniston especially , seems to have phoned this one in
dull and pointless how could jennifer aniston read this script and think that doing this film was a good idea \? we had to turn it off about half way through shallow , boring , superficial take your pick it 's like a contest which character 's life sucks the most if you 're going to depress people , at least make it interesting would it have been so hard for the writers to mix in a plot with their nihilism
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50 's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man , with firth as the anchor of the team off stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives but i found truth confusing and unengaging i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo and as several have noted , lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible give this one a pass
the human race today is in a really bad state , mainly because most people do not want to wake up they want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power miceal ledwith in the great questions in the hamburger universe , vol 1 of deep deceptions
chamber was always the worst entry in the harry potter series , but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse choppy editing , horrible humor personified by the untalented rupert grint , smug acting by the equally untalented emma watson , poor screenwriting by that hack steve kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack chris columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience
perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln 's various works , such as the sacred place , the messianic legacy , and holy blood , holy grail , or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books
i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i did n't want to leave the house i was a little disappointed in this dvd i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising the routines are broken down into four separate workouts the only one that involved any effort on my part was the pilates inspired section as for the rest , the other sections would have you do too few reps , i felt , to get your muscles warmed up , let alone reshape them i think this dvd is great for beginners its simple enough to follow and it wo n't scare you away too soon but if you 're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine , this probably is n't the abs workout for you
i looked at the name \( groovaloos \) and i looked at the cover and my gut told me not to get this dvd i went against my gut and believed the reviews i wish i 'd listened to my gut for those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey , you 're right on the money they can all dance , but compared to what i expected , they seemed mediocre here 's the lowdown \( 1 \) the sound sucks they 're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine , but the music is n't loud enough to really feel something that makes you want to move , \( 2 \) they just seem like a group of people who do n't naturally have a rhythm , but they 've learned some moves it 's so not inspiring , \( 3 \) it 's not edgy enough , and \( 4 \) it looks good if you 've got a group doing it , but when someone 's doing it alone , it 's just okay overall , this dvd was okay , but not great get it only if you 're truly desperate
i was a huge fan of the books growing up , and a lover of the period and jannette oke 's books i had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series well , i just finished and could hardly stop from yawning while i watched !
viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time many of those films that stand the test of time are from the fantasy genre , including labyrinth and dark crystal would i add neverending story to that list \? hell no the dubbing is atrocious \( funny germans \) , and the costumes and effects are flat out bad labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days , and easily trumped neverending story when it was released two years later the story and plot had the potential to be interesting , but the execution makes neverending fall flat and sure , neverending story may have advocated reading in the mid 80 's , but labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics , which is the next step up for mind expansion
unwatchable ! ! ! ! ! over rated poet singers who sing off key aggrandizing this mediocrity is ludicrous
i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5 in my mind this is a whole new venture , one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley 's a great hero
francisco was right , this film is about as well conceived as buttcrust
there was one scary moment in this movie the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she dies now that was creepy i then awaited more moments like that nothing nada lame tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb and that young boy what is up with that \? \? he 's trying to be like the kid in the sixth sense \( who was brilliant and totally believable \) this movie did not scare me and the idea of people being afraid to use vhs tapes after this \? come on
i have not seen this movie , nor do i ever want to i 've only seen the previews on tv and read about it in previews why do i think it 's probably one of the stupidest , pointless movies on the face of the earth \? , because i bet just about every guy who 's had trouble getting girls watched it , took notes , and believed each and every single thing that was in this movie , and believed every sentence that was in this movie where you got to hear the woman thinking out loud in the movie i bet many guys took this movie way too seriously
having enjoyed lost in translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i ca n't fathom the entire plot is self serving , shallow , and unrealistic i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values , and while i do n't condone those , the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it , and it does n't mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! \?
i bought this dvd for my collection i do not buy full screen format dvds amazon described the dvd as anamorphic , closed captioned , color , dolby , full screen , widescreen , ntsc with an aspect ration of 2 35 1 however , when it arrived , it was full screen only with an aspect ratio of 1 33 1 consequently , i returned it my recommendation , if you only want widescreen , do n't believe the description that this dvd is dual layered and do n't buy it
julia roberts plays ed harris' young new wife susan sarandon plays harris' ex wife ex wife does not like new wife new wife does not like ex wife ex wife 's cutsey , but bratty kids make new wife 's life a living hell ex wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo new wife thinks ex wife is a nagging battle axe new wife and ex wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum how does the film solve this conflict \? ex wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer everyone reconciles , ex wife and new wife suddenly love each other , the end this is one of the most cliched , saccharine , hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by hollywood in the past decade if you like julia roberts , susan sarandon or ed harris , please see erin brokovich , dead man walking and the right stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe
it is a shame that american film classics \( like l and h \) get more attention and love outside of the us than in it
personally , i found 8 1 2 to be one of the most boring films i 've ever seen it was a pretentious , self indulgent trip down the director 's memory lane i understood the plot , and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end , but overall was bored silly by stilted , pointless dialogue
okay , this is a really bad movie that said , there are some moments here that are so over the top bad that they 're funny the fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving sandra bullock is outright hilarious and very embarassing how she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery , but the acting in that scene is ridiculous , as well however , it is certainly memorable sandra bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film , but her role is essentially a throw away part then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor steve buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in his character never returns to the story after that by the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues the acting is bad , the budget is obviously low , and the script , which invokes the occasional giggle , is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel avoid this film
what do we do
not a bad movie not a great movie ellen brustyn was great
i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective film fans and alec baldwin groupies \( a k a my mom , my stepfather , and me \) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment baldwin , who also served as co producer , brought james lee burke 's new orleans ex cop recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy tough guy gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things
i'm not going to write too much if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here
after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast , carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well \? my reasons for asking , the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen , yet in the original film selena , alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school , also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there 's selen'as boyfriend \( whose name escapes me at the moment \) in the original film he stood by her , through the murder charges , the revelation of the rape , and the miscarriage , yet in the sequel i'm suppose to buy that he could n't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena , yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast \? i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film was n't taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all
this program is evil it is easy to get sucked into watching gantz , because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters , who have all died , find themselves in they have gone to purgatory , and purgatory is like an all too real video game one feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries
i would n't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that i had to when i saw what christiane schmidt had to say
let me just start by saying that i do n't own the chosen collection but that i do own the original releases of all seven seasons
this movie is the most boring , uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever
director turi meyer
the saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series i can remember the first time i watched the original created by clive barker , i luv 'd it , the same ca n't be said for this film caroline is last living descendent of the candyman , and he wants to end it all by ending her all who watch this film and the acting of donna d' errico will wish for the same thing one would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of baywatch for the film and for that reason only , or maybe it 's because a little fragile thing like her ca n't take on candyman head on get a real actress like kathy bates in there and she 'll kick his ass misery is a classic
maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking , but i doubt it since vanilla ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie , the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new i went to high school with kids like this and i 've bought the eminem cd and there 's a little more to them than the stupidity but let 's discuss the movie
this is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub plots because there are none there is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie , so it makes for excellent escapism , which we all need now and then since all the characters stay together , it is easy to follow along , so you can turn your brain off , it wo n't be needed since it 's all about the ship , acting was n't necessary you can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of russell and dreyfus i felt pity for them as actors , and hope they can rebound the movie is shorter than most , so there will be minimum impact on your life you will remember nothing about it soon after exposure
i am 38 and considered obese , however i work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy this dvd would be great for the older generations i still need to loose 45 pounds and i am using denise austin 's burn fat fast
i think denise austin does a decent job in some of her other videos , but this is n't one of them she lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she 's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot the moves are not well choreographed and very awkward some may find encouragement in the times denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says we 're burning butter yeah but i found it annoying i think there are much better workouts for the money out there
definatly one of the worst movies ever the dialog is so boring i had an a d d attack trying to watch it i usally never turn a movie off in the middle but i had to do it with this one i tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it , so i would never have to suffer through this again the characters are so lame i did'nt even care about who was threating his life i wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it it fu in sucks ! ! ! ! ! and it is really dated
love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain , so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here , years later , when i'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
this movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre , far less interesting than pulp fiction and even below the level of reservoir dogs it is said that in the violent late middle ages street shows were often staged in european cities where fake blood flowed like water , heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines during an evisceration delighting the crowd it seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come full circle from barbara tuchman 's gripping account of the awful fourteenth century despite the abundant gore if the film had been better handled it could have been quite good there are glimpses of its failed potential at different points for instance the scene towards the end where the prison governor 's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct copy of an actual event at the bastille during the days of the early french revolution in sum , as a special kind of disgusting art form it is interesting , as entertainment though natural born killers sucks i admit some people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend public executions if they were available for viewing
i felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer after about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so i turned it off
i was on a plane from shanghai to bangkok stop drooling and i was reading a book on the tv , i saw tim allen chasing an orange cat in the course of the chase , he dropped down from two legs to four the effects , i 'll admit right up front , were great this looked far better than the old 70s \( i think \) version called the shaggy d a , which i have n't seen but even so , it sucks i did n't need sound or subtitles , and i did n't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks true sucking is like that \( yeah , i saw the bit with the scrabble board i am dad whoop dee freaking doggy doo \) it 's possible we underestimate tim allen 's ability as an actor , perhaps because the santa clause was so unforgivably bad but even so , this movie sucks sometimes life is just that simple
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival , and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is the whole cast is wasted in this movie , and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better like pretty much the leads in this movies , i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in , but this one , they might as well if your a tim allen fan , please do yourself a favor , and get either the santa clause movies , or the toy story movies , and avoid this movie at all costs here are 99 minuts of my life , that i wo n't see again , and i am trying to make sure that you do n't waste your time on this dud who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog , in some scenes in the movie , ore pretty much the whole thing i have n't seen monster house or cars , but i hope that these will be 2 better movies , or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this dave douglas \( tim allen \) is a lawyer , that dislikes dogs , and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester \( joshua leonard \) and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant strictland and he does n't much of a family life , since he is never home , and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie \? his wife is rebecca douglas \( kristin davis \) and they have 2 children josh \( spencer breslin \) and carly \( zena grey \) and he has an appoontment to josh 's pta meetings , and even through he is reminded at work , he forgets carly is not only a is both forrester 's student and a budding animal advocate herself , and her brother is trying out for football like his dad , even through he secretly hates it , and did n't sign up for the fall musical and then there is a mad scientist \( robert downey jr \) , trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300 year old dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery and carly even kidnaps it from grant strictland , and brings him home , nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas , that gets him starting acting like a dog too , and even looking exactly like him at times the movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old , which would be impossible , since neither dogs or people live that long , all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes , and this is one to avoid at all costs
it 's a disgrace they charge money for this dvd producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold
this was purhcased by accident but still one of the crapiest movies i ever seen story wise , well it 's bad to see what situation young girls could have with whores for mothers and growing up just like them it 's actualy very sad to see young girls throwing away their life away other wise , movie had bad ending , good quality packing and dvd from amazon com
mccully 1
this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package ! ! ! ! ! ! amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens !
i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics , or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i cannot compare the character to other sources therefore , coming from someone that did not know darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment !
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even boring to my friends so it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me it is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me it was n't the violence \( in short bursts \) it was n't the acting \( the acting was pretty good actually \) but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure i did n't care who was sending the tapes and i did n't care what would happen with the main characters they were unrelatable on just about any level this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 4 's of the way in and you 'll think , wow i wonder where the story will go next and then it does n't that was it very disappointing i do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's some kinda payoff in the end i really do n't understand all the acclaim that this movie got as a suspense movie or as an art film it fails pretty miserably the premise was a good idea that went nowhere slowly viewer beware
this movie sucks ! it is fake , everything is staged chicks dont laugh when they fight , nor do they dress like strippers !
this dvd sucks , all the fights are fake , retarted , drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time i 've ever had in my life i am now stupider for watching this dvd and buying it is on my list of regrets i have in life i wish i could say the only good part was but there was no good part no shirts ripped off or good hits thrown , nothing i am a marine stationed in japan looking for a dvd to enjoy and this is what i get where is the love
killing me softly has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break not only does it set up an improbable situation , but the big twist at the end is also mind numbingly predictable \( unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life \) the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned , he 's an inexpressive bloke , while heather graham is all too expressive she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera besides , she 's not even that attractive even her co star in this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out of the water in that department the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth , sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did , i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly
whatever possessed jessica lange to appear in this mess will never be known the payoff at the end is a huge disappointment jessica lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in gwyneth paltrow is unbelievably bad but i think this is not their fault the screenplay and direction could have been better this could have been a very good movie along the lines of misery or fatal attraction but it fails in every department as i said , the payoff at the end is a real disappointment this film is a waste of time and money stay away from it !
kelly preston and tcheky karyo are a new york city couple who come together after preston leaves matthew broderick and karyo uses meg ryan in order to get a visa now broderick and ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex 's the problem is , the offenses they 've endured \( being dumped and being used \) do n't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people , especially karyo which is probably why first time director griffin dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles after all , how can we not root for ferris bueller and harry 's sally \? unfortunately , it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive , the pace of the film is so uneven , and the script is n't particularly funny
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism
i have been a beatles fan since 1964 , and i have distinct memories of the band 's influence on my young life i saw hard day 's night , help ! , yellow submarine , and let it be in the theater when they were first released this film has always been the holy grail of beatle fandom
upon its initial release , the attention that otto preminger 's anatomy of a murder attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems when watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock , its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center
there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound , then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash , but at least that was \( somewhat \) assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours , and as much as i \( usually \) enjoy george clooney , i might never forgive him for this drek
viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching , waiting , hoping ! ! ! , the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough , must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture my advise is for you to save your money and buy comos \( the best imo \) to be honest , i could n't wait to sell it used at a 10 lose through amzn the following week \( they get a commission for sold items \) nonetheless , i am content i no longer own it next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn just so you know , cosmos i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn the late carl sagans cosmos blows away the astronomer
i am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good ratings ive been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like because this movie stinks !
george sluizer 's original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version , you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head , but the film had plenty more to offer than that , playing with chronology , subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes' plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself , but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered
while some critics can argue with dan brown 's research and reasoning on certain historical points , one thing these da vinci debunking presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity , primarily by the catholic church , and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago 1969 nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light , when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago , with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still , quite frankly , shocking and debasing sorry , but upon this rock of male dominancy was built the church
i enjoyed the movie even though i was only able to watch it in segments the first time i tried to watch it , after about 20 minutes , the screen went to digital gibberish and my dvd player hung up so that i could n't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power i had to unplug the dvd player , wait , and replug the power cord to remove the disc overnight , i decided i needed to replace my dvd player however , the next morning , i tried a different dvd and it worked fine it still works fine on all my other dvds i complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of showgirls unfortunately , this one has the same problem it plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my dvd player i gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without showgirls i use my dvd player almost every day and it works fine except when i try to watch showgirls
i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common i ca n't say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire taught me about roman a clefs , of which devil is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor in chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second \( or third \) made over princess role the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend lily , are mostly wasted
i was under the impression that this was the entire series i finally , after many issues , got my set and unwrapped it , and my heart sank audibly when i saw complete collection i i popped the last disk in and lo and behold , it was n't the full series afterall
the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is reservior dogs this has great actors in it i enjoyed seeing , f'instance , dame dunaway but , she , sinise , dillon , mantegna , and perpetual co lister faison had a poor dialog to work with imagine if qt had written it or , my favorite tough guy screenwriter , david mamet fortunately though , spacey will have something to build on develop a director 's repertoire
during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically , the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was spot on , and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd 's characters and keeping in form , he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film , but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries , and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however , his contribution seems way overstated to me he does n't have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think , jar jar blinks i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that 's it flat and mechanical
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie , i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander , got my tickets in advance , and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater
enjoyed leary 's rescue me and the job so much but was really disappointed in his stand up not funny and over done
this must have seemed like a great idea at the time , cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor the problem is his range is all the way from a to b
even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the true story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess \( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character \)
there are no words to describe how awful \( ! ! ! \) this movie was from beginning to end , but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day evening from being ruined the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is touched by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle need i say more \?
this movie is not vulgar nor does it rate nc17 dont believe the hype check out pink flamingos instead , now that is a vulgarly righteous movie by waters and the with the goddess of filth devine
i watched this movie all the way through only because i paid 22 00 plus shipping and felt i should give it every chance to redeem itself it is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings i would give it 10 ! ! rated r for what \? language \? adult content \? i have seen disney films more deserving of the r rating this movie was silly , definitely not entertaining in any way and i threw it in the same bucket i put my dog 's crap in when i clean up the yard i am a chris isaak fan , have all his cds and went to his concert on december 9 the fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately , even his music i did not find the film offensive , i enjoy hard core porn i feel this is a rip off , poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone ! ! !
during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically , the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was spot on , and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood
the film has its amusing and even touching points , but not very many the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters henry is just the kind of self important , ego bloated , smug , arrogant , cold blooded corporate ass that 's helped step on working people for real , so it 's really hard to feel anything for him , shot or not he 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him , and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is , if you think about it , appalling and his wife is , in a way , even worse she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up , and does n't become normal ntil much later only their daughter has any heart at all maybe a better ending would 've been henry 's not making it , bening going nuts from losing her stuff , and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should 've been from day one barely watchable
love michael buble , but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience parts of michael 's head was cut off , and then sometimes , his whole head was cut off most of the time , the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert that this was just home made videos this was definitely not worth 20 if you want a professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act caught in the act was worth the 20 bucks you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements , and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd also , the sound quality on caught in the act was way better now , i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it the dvd that i received was not enhanced anyways , skip this one , and get caught in the act instead
this was so messy and mr dorrington so over the top in
i remember loving this movie and all of its silliness i recently made it a nostalgia purchase and realized it is n't that great but my 6 year old loved it and continues to watch it all the time my child is now a weird al fanatic and i am ok woth that
this dvd covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds ! it does not give enough body to the addition explanation and is hard to follow it was a pure waste of money
do not buy this dvd as it is a total waste of money , joe walsh can
this show is so boring all it 's about is poltics what was hbo thinking having the one of the oddest shows out , it does n't play no background music even when it 's going off and all the people do on that show is argue like petie little children , in one episode i found very shocking to hear was from a blond hair woman saying the two oldest sons of saddam hussian that died they made their bodies into make up she said it 's so \( queer eye for the straite guy \) and another episode she call a gay a fag , i did n't know she had that in her what i found weird was why would actor george clooney would talk what the show is all about during previews , he has nothing to do with political things thank god k street never did get a second season
jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end the only mystery is in the details no real suspense i found the plot to be a little farfetched
this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that i saw it in a free sneak preview
despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality , this film is a complete put on the long set piece scenes \( wedding , russian roulette , etc \) are much discussed , usually either in the context of being essential for character development or boring in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills once he does try to move things along , awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set piece to another , you can see the reason for his procrastination despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth , he really has nothing to say the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness , by giving false and short lived impressions of character and narrative , but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything happen narrative wise
so so story about a man 's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star 's mother
about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick , incestuous , and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood , do n't watch this
waste of time i turned it off the extra features were slightly interesting the actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing a vanity piece why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating , badly written melodrama do n't bother
this pride and prejudice fan was hoping for a modern day movie with a storyline much closer to pride and prejudice even colin firth could'nt save this one for me ! on its own i found it sadly lacking in just about everything i look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor if you are a true pride and prejudice fan , i recommend buying the bbc series and the 2005 movie version both are excellent i would'nt waste my time again with this one
if this movie were set in the us , i would 've given it 1 star but the british accent , humor , and colloquialisms partially saved it but not enough , sorry to say !
it seems like the actors did n't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts ! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot overly timid and shy captain wentworth is n't at all handsome or dashing and when they finally get together at the end , it 's so awkward , bland , and unclimactic you wished you 'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book some people might have liked it , but i definitely did n't to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like , i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice this movie could have been bette

all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane 's life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane 's life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is , at best , an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect
i was optimistic for greg kinnear once he was very funny ragging on soap soup he usually plays the nice guy second banana in film or a man dying of aids auto focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960 's tv icon , hogan , in hogan 's heroes the replication of the original cast is a bit eerie after all , these actors dress up as german prison guards a chill goes down my spine , but hogan 's was a comedy , which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny ss guys anyhow , bob crane played hogan for six years and kinnear badly imitated yes , i'm sorry to say , kinnear is awful as crane , which puts a damper on the bio flick
this has not aged well the scripts are silly , the acting is of the chewing up the scenery variety gale storm no longer seems cute she comes across as annoyingly perky spend your money on something else
i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife here are my gut impressions
the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo \( apparently supernatural \? \) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as do you believe in ghosts \? the lighter scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in 3d yet the polar express still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children
this film is a tough one to review the film itself is amazing so therefore , i should give it high marks the problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos , and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature \( as if we came from outer space or something \) that is a bad and dangerous message , and so i feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
there 's a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one her acting debut i 'll be there is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so
the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two , and the first dvd had good color saturation , dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now , though , and the image of course is higher resolution
this was probably the worst royal rumble in history it featured three very bad matches , one decent one , a lousy royal rumble and an absolutely amazing match
let 's face it some of the jokes are funny the one about mike tyson been like someone else 's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny i also found the bit about bill clinton and osama bin laden also funny however , jamie dwells too much on the fart joke how can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes \? after 2 min it becomes worn and so unfunny why does he repeat himself so much with that line , i am not saying she 's a crackhead , just a bit crackish \? it sounds very rehearsed after the second time if it were only for these errors i would have found the jokes altogether acceptable
i enjoy the initial season of murder she wrote very much my wife and i are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to who dun it frequently , though , it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up often the audio gets out of synch with the video terrible ! we surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons , but now about 3 4 the way through , i think we 'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided dvd 's
i , too , found this dvd a bit boring the instruction for each pose took forever , even in the challenging workouts while in depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices , i did n't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence also , i did not feel as if there was any flow to this dvd
terrible voice , depressing indoor scenery , incredibly disjointed routines do n't bother with this one ! save your money
but for me at least , i found it rather hard to root for mel gibson 's character , given the fact that he was a major , major drug dealer when the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with michelle pfeiffer and all the loot , i did n't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict gibson as a loving father , a phenomenally successful businessman , and a super stud , one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes drug dealing
michael moore can be really funny at times , but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' , i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films
paul newman plays a burned out private eye and gene hackman and susan sarandon are a movie star couple with a long buried dark secret too implausible , too many overdrawn secondary characters a rental at best
do n't bother wasting your time with this movie , instead read the book the book was one of the best i have ever read , the movie left me wanting i rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through so maybe i am being unfair since i did not watch the whole movie , but honestly i could n't , it just did n't do the story justice
this movie is the most boring , uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever
i myself am a huge buffy angel fan , i had read the reviews here and i thought it was worth a shot seeing it well the script was terrible , the story even worse , direction do n't get me started one reviewer said it , it was like they did n't know whose point of view to choose the soundtrack was awful the ending was sooo stupid did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them they just keep standing there like nothing is happening i really have n't seen a movie this bad in well ever ! ! oh and alyson hannigan 's acting was way better in my stepmother is an alien i think she was about 13 in that role do n't get me wrong she 's a extremely talented actress i blame it on the script
if you are willing to risk to watch this movie , just a warning it 's really a turkey , one of the big ones
i thought the movie was alright , but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus , i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
this movie was a bit lame for me robin williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie , and the supporting cast was n't much better , but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen even if this had been a good movie , the green screen was very distracting i would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff
i was so disappointed with this video i thought it would contain more than it did , but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all
if you have bothered to read all the other reviews here , i think you will get the point , but still unsure \?
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me poor acting and hard to understand dialoge would get a refund if you were in australia but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas and it could get lost in the mail
this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times the owens girls are hereditary witches , any man who loves one is doomed to an early death there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion , this requires the sacrifice of a dove two little girls watch years later they 're grown up one leaves to live with her boyfriend but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck \( never stand in the middle of a road \) we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell witch , as if to symbolize something
ok , the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long \? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters
after i read erik larson 's wonderful book the devil in the white city i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes' story but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment the production is amateurish at best , complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of mondo carne with such a wealth of fascinating information available \( court transcripts , etc \) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened \? this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland truly disappointing perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes this most certainly is n't it
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
this is my number one most overrated movie of all time we saw it at a pretensious artsy theater , along with an assortment of ex hippies and wooly haired intellectuals they all cheered , of course , when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water , then becomes the chief the truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable , given the politically correct theme the truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture the truth is that tradition is not inherently evil the truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys basically , if you hate men , this is the flick for you but it is not good it is not creative there are no surprises there is just nothing there as i edit this , it 's no surprise to find so few people liked this review there are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so and so 's out there
hello \? \? \? \? \?
this disc is like a whitman 's candy sampler it has a lot of different things but a lot of the things you do n't really want the film covers kids , high schoolers , college ball and college recruiting pay controversies , aba , nba through all its decades , harlem globetrotters , the street game and inner city stars , country boys , indiana basketball , retired old timers hanging in florida , current stars , marketing \( are there any hoop videos that do n't talk about sneaker brands \) , public relations , fireworks , cheerleaders , guys on trampolines , women 's basketball whew none of these subjects is studied in depth if you 've followed basketball for a while , you know and have seen most of this the subject sampling seems to jump all over the place , so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want i 'd rather see a dvd star profile \( jordon , iverson \) or nba at 50 or spike lee 's movie , or hoop dreams , etc 1 love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a wilson basketball or it seems like something you 'd see on sunday tv , after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends in short , 1 love is a decent sampling , but nothing to sink your teeth into
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
comedy comes in many forms everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire and in just friends there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types first , the movie wants to be a gross out comedy the sight gags are plentiful , the physical comedy abundant and often cruel , and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic however , the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart these elements have been combined successfully in the past there 's something about mary jumps right to mind here , we get something far less successful
i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years stupid , stupid and stupid ryan reynolds becomes annoying
in spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women , the comedian bernie mac stole this picture ! he played his part of the low life , club owning , hustler with perfect timing and high humor he made this movie enjoyable to watch
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off , it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that , the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school , i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love
i think this film wants to make you vomit i do n't know about you , but that is not a quality i am looking for in my films being scared is fine being in suspense is great , vomiting is not i really think that is what this film was going for it has some pretty disgusting moments while i was watching it i kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes in fact , i am feeling it now as i write this review and think about the movie
i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am i thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself
the video in this dvd looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a dvd disc a standard 4 7gb disc , by the way that 's what you 'll get when you buy this
we were disappointed in this dvd and thought it was a waste of money we did not learn anything new they went through things quickly , everything was so basic , things that are mainly common sense i felt this was a big huge waste of money , and is now in the trash
this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant , in other words , what you learn here wo n't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics , such as how to breastfeed properly , how to bottlefeed properly , how to swaddle properly , how to calm a baby properly , etc all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn , each is given about 5 seconds of screen time instead , the bulk of the program is wasted on things like pre birth preparation , which interestingly appears toward the end of the program , and how the mother should take care of herself these are important things to know , but not for a ultimate baby care dvd
our daughter has weak muscles and i wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy i saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears not ! it did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us
when i was looking for a fitness dvd for me and my two oldest children \( girls , ages 3 1 2 and 2 \) to do together , i was impressed with the reviews of this dvd and it sounded intriguing though i was n't really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet , so we rented it from netflixs to try it out first
the hidden fortress is classic kurosawa , in every way except for the wild overacting , inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued , or given comic material with more edge , skewering the upper classes as well as themselves , or been less in the focus and operated far in the background , this would n't have been a problem but instead we 're offered a sort of dumb dumber , beavis butthead of japan , 50 years ago \( and yes , i know that is anachronistic , but it 's all too true \) stupidity is funny wears thin after a short while , and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast oh , here comes a rocky upwards incline let 's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up , etc
it is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by roger moore' performance her 's good for a dandy , in the continent , but in this film he is not convincing at all he is verry debonnaire , like he is just sipping tea in great britain thus , the film becomes stiff and you do n't believe it the other actors simply try to do something , like a farce it is a pity to see the great richard burton in such role
as usual , michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours theres alot of great stuff here \( the interview w marilyn manson , the interview w trey parker , c \) , but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling , no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston i agree with many , nay most of moores politics but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution
this stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners this was the first stability ball dvd that i purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level if you are a beginner , i would recommend leslie sansone 's you can do stability ball training if you are a beginner or more advanced , i would recommend denise austin 's shrink the female fat zone or the quickfix stability ball training my all time favorite dvd for the stability ball is denise austin this is by far my least favorite
this workout was very hard for me to get into i became very bored by it the moves were challenging but the routine was blah if you are a beginner , this is not for you you are better off purchasing quick fix stability ball workout no matter what your level of fitness
boring and like most every other new horror movie lame mask , i think the awful movie cut used this mask also , who cares i suppose this goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies \( scream , i know what you did , valentine , urban legend , cut etc \) so bottom line do n't waste your time , stick with 80 's slashers
i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in you got served and was extremely disappointed the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those , i do n't know the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch , but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
what movie was every one else watching \? certainly not this one very , very , slow disjointed story line i hate to be a bore but this was boring enjoy
the first butterfly effect is one of my all time favorite movies with that in mind , i eagerly started watching be2 within the first 5 minutes it became clear that i was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie but after finishing it , it was clear that i would have to flat out lie to do that
nick lachey and jessica simpson have a few good moments in the nick and jessica variety hour but the show looks too '70s in its premise , too donny and marie ish in some parts and sonny and cher in some others lachey 's performance with babyface is nice how come babyface did n't produce nick 's entire solo album instead of the batch of people nick went to that caused soul o to flop \? he would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to but having mr t and johnny bench and kenny rogers makes the show look , sadly , too 1983 ish how come they could n't get somebody current to perform on it , say maroon 5 or kanye west , who were both hot last april \? they wanted to bring back the variety show format , but it 's very hard to do it in an internet age and jessica is n't all that good on this show i 'd rather hear her music and albums instead they need to bring new things to the format if they 're going to make another show for now , lachey and simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this !
i love love love this movie , but you have to make sure you get the vhs version \( where the vhs cover is the cast riding in the car \) lucky for me , this is the one i own by mistake , i purchased the wrong version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together the music in the dvd version is terrible compared to the original \( do n't even get me started on the c d soundtrack \) whoever made the blunder of re doing this for dvd re release needs to be fired
it is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action comedy hybrid , however it just does n't work the action scenes seem tacked on and the gags just do n't work
instructions rent steven seagall 's latest action movie knuckle fest exit wounds insert in dvd player watch first 15 minutes of movie , remove from dvd player return to video store
i bought this dvd after watching jessica simpson 's latest music video these boots are made for walkin' i thought her reality tour live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed may be ok for those who just want to watch jessica sing
jessica simpson is a talentless bimbo she is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing brittany and christina for showing too much skin we all know now that the hypocritical jessica simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right she is not a role model and her songs tv specials are lower than below average
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
i was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my dvd player and sat down to watch it did n't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film the story was interesting and had it been done in a better way , the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as trick and latter days where the acting and production quality were very good , i found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments it is not a movie i would readily recommend
i just wanted to find out and please let me know dat is the a teens music video heartbreak lullaby which is part of the soundtrack for the movie on the princess diaries dvd lyke as in the bonus features or something \? \? ive been trying find out but i cant so plzz lemme know cuz i just wanna get the dvd for the music video ! !
if you have n't already seen this one , do not wait until tomorrow , do it today
these are old disney shows from 2 series i saw then on the late night vault disney series they were well done and interesting the only problem is that this dvd is only a few \( 6 total \) of the 18 shows so although i would rate the shows as a 4 or 5 , this release gets 1 star for being incomplete
good grief yet another dvd collection we are not buying because disney does n't seem to understand we loved these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete i hope the folks at disney get the message eventually same thing applies to their live action feature films disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production
maybe this is not fair , to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews , and i am not buying this dvd , as swamp fox is incomplete ! three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase
i recently saw les miserables 10th anniversary concert on dvd and absolutely fell in love with it so i thought i would try something similar and decided to give candide try boy , was i disappointed i ca n't get past the first 30 minutes all these silly gimmicky jokes that are not even remotely funny the singing is not bad \( this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in les miz \) but the choreography is trite and unimaginative , and the acting so juvenille that you 'd think the characters are retarded when the narrator fired his gun and a bang flag shot out from the gun instead that was over the top for me yuck
my impression was what a waste of money why take such a nice play and do it like that \? why \? what 's that old lady \? what sort of character mrs lupone built \? i read the reviews here and i did n't believe them i should have had but there are good moments though imaginative , creative , although far from funny
as i write this review , it was 5 years ago this very day that the walt disney co released the classic fantasia for the first time on dvd as a 60th anniversary special edition but exactly 5 years later , you can no longer purchase a legitimate , new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price , via such avenues as ebay
do n't bother just do n't bother it 's sad to see
i hope i can give a fair rating here , but as one member who loves to watch lds films of all types , this one is a big let down i normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good this one was just overkill that was not even funny i initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like nursury comedy if you know what i mean i turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the wedding gown infomercial in a movie
robert wiene 's the cabinet of dr caligari is a celebrated work of german expressionism while there are several interesting facets to it , this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success
there is a coliseum video about the world heavyweight title the tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign that tape is great gorilla moonsoon with the commentary the jr commentary does n't make this garbage any better the matches are like de ja vu let me think yes i have seen these before because these matches are on each and every other dvd the extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change i really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds i know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans i know i voted were the votes counted in florida \? there are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd i got the first disc from netflix because i was not going to buy it some may say he is crazy it was great maybe for you it is i have seen all of that before i wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history there are no perspective segments or interviews just overrated jr running his yap over matches he never called i want to hear the real commentary with jesse not jr but wwe screwed that up there are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now oh i mean entertainment it 's garbage now wwe has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one hitman , jake roberts , road warriors , monday night etc etc the dvds about the old days are the only things i look forward to because their current product is garbage so when the thing i look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if i get a little ticked off experienced wrestling fan get it on netflix or borrow it and go and get the coliseum video if you can find it rookie fan it would be informative to you
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism
i am always up for a new genre of film , but the reviews here are misleading the basic plot of the movie is that life sucks \( yeah thats it \) the rest of it is just sick if your really into perversion then okay you 'd probably get more out of it then i did , but for the viewers who have n't been almost raped by their fathers , or killed their grandparents or shot themselves in public this is n't the movie for you if you still want to see the movie try and get it from netflix or borrow it from a friend before you dish out the cash
a coffee table book come to life , ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid 20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it
there are cinematic masterpieces , and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest this stinker convinced me mr lynch owned shares in kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile the only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a david lynch work ever again do not buy it ! ! manos , the hands of fate is much more watchable than this
how he gets away with it i will never understand orson welles was a clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms \( that 's what you do when you ca n't make art \) do n't worry , there is always rossellini , fellini , renoir , bergman , dreyer
the criterion collection , a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films , is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award winning , original supplements the foundation of the collection is the work of such \( real \) masters of cinema as renoir , godard , kurosawa , cocteau , fellini , bergman , tarkovsky , hitchcock , fuller , lean , kubrick , lang , sturges , dreyer , eisenstein , ozu , sirk , bunuel , powell and pressburger
this was not very good , in my opinion the ring scared the bejeezus outta me this was not scary two weeks afterwards , i still find my mind wandering about one thing why the heck did n't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room \? if i walk into my house and see a half naked boy meowing and hissing at me , i'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
while viewing the dvd elizabeth i , we noticed many imperfections requiring restarts and or interruptions of our viewing this is the first dvd that we have ever seen with imperfections
this story is one of the worst fantasy stories ever it is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo christian story line do n't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to lord of the rings or harry potter for original \( not to mention secular \) fantasy and escape
i did n't like this video for several reasons the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands i was looking for an aerobic video i have gilad bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years let me just say i'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me you do n't even feel like you had a workout with her she 's boring i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning tamilee is awesome i have many of her videos and i'm a true fan of hers
this program was boring ! as much as billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated , about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were , and of course my kids at home , and i'm sure any other kid picked up on this , and soon lost interest
this movie does not make sense and it 's not weird in the style of david lynch , it 's just complete crap i thought willie wonka and the chocolate factory was the worst stupidest fil ever until i saw this do not buy this it is not a family movie , and it is not funny or entertaining
i purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since gone with the wind give me a break !
i agree with others ! season by season box sets of beavis butt head are what we fans want ! with all music and b b commentary and no damned edits of anything !
i dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv the videos were the best part ! i asume its because mtv did n't want to pay royalties to the bands , so they called it the mike judge collection and left them out uh , that sucks
i bought this dvd hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy there is no story or plot to it , so i ended up throwing it away i really regret buying it
each scene is one shot , and that shot goes on and on and on , sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action this film is pretension personified , but that 's okay many people ca n't tell the difference between pretension and art the music too is full of squeaks and squawks in case you did n't know , that means that the music too is high art
warning spoiler
geez , maybe i have a heart of stone i was n't a bit moved by the overrated streep and handsome clint it 's a story about two hearts linked as one a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy , bored adults yawwwwn streep can do any accent on the planet , and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than marcel marceau that does n't make her an actress just a clever chameleon i 'd rather watch julia roberts play herself over and over and over than see streep play pretend roles there , i 've said it now goodnight
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no , not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids , that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack , a travesty to the nth degree
legal eagles is supposed to be a comedy we 're supposed to find the characters played by robert redford and debra winger to be amusing , their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious , and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying
this is entertainment \? wow , exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat
so so movie it has it 's good parts along with some boring parts but overall , good special effects with the ghosts there were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch when a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew , he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of many ghosts just a ok movie
thirteen ghosts is about a machine this machine was designed by a man who was at the time possessed my satan yes , satan if the plot does n't seem stupid enough , it needs ghosts to power it ghostbusters anyone \? at the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a michael j fox movie as time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts if done right , it opens the 'eye to hell'
i generally like some of these french comic books turned into movies because they 're usually pretty erotic jane fonda 's role in barbarella comes to mind this gwendoline series definitely had the potential what with the scantily clad women in bondage theme and the scenes involving gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend
harold ramis 's the ice harvest wallows in mid market crime and holiday angst , but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires all the ingredients are there , but ultimately the movie lacks spice in some movies , it works where all the characters move at a slow pace nobody 's fool , for example but a dark comedy needs some pep , and the ice harvest does n't have it
long , tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog , bad plot holes , and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from bad boys
after 40 minutes of objective viewing , and shot after superfluous shot , i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not , or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from higher ups kong is not an epic , it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing , if you will , but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in , i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this mr jackson , no more 'epic fly by shots please
eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention , but overall the movie displayed poor acting , stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot this movie possibly will be owned by many , but remembered by few james caan was the only talent that eraser has to offer sorry guys , my wife bought it , i watched it , gave it away and divorced her
this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it 's the michael jackson ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww \? it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe , what does that mean \? when are screenwriters going to figure it out \? either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids , they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton , if you are not a fan of either , do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !
seems like this video could be useful , but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it , yet alone trying to work out to it some of the moves were cool , but all in all i will trade this in for something else
george sluizer 's original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version , you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head , but the film had plenty more to offer than that , playing with chronology , subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes' plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself , but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered
joel hershman 's greenfingers , starring the now famous \( and utterly gorgeous \) clive owen and helen mirren , is a sweet , cutesy , and utterly empty british romantic comedy in this forgettable , generic chick flick , inmates at a british minimum security prison take up gardening initially , they are understandably reluctant to garden but , get this , gardening ends up changing their lives ! and , after his parole , owen 's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden ! and mirren 's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her ! wow , where do people get this stuff \?
the flight into new york had been a long one but i was gently revived when kirsten dunst met me at the airport she was to be my escort that night at the lincoln center where the president would present me the distinguished writer 's cross the highest award this nation can bestow on an author i quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her mercedes s class sedan to the waldorf astoria downtown
someone bought this 3d dvd for my almost 5 year old daughter we thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were however , within minutes of the movie 's beginning my daughter was in tears i wo n't say why but she found the plot frightening several times during the movie i tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end fortunately the movie is relatively short overall , i found the story to be a cynical look at christmas as an adult , i think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of christmas shopping but i urge caution before showing it to young children there was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of christmas
wow hard to put into words how bad this was we kept waiting for the funny it never came we did n't even watch the end when they started turning julia roberts \( tess \) into the real julia roberts well we were done note funny no
the movie itself is just as good i remembered it but the criterion collection dvd package , however , is so totally not worth the 40 plus postage i paid for it i 've gotten so much more bang for my buck with other special edition type dvds i found the interviews and extra stuff dull i want my money back
it is unusual that i disagree with so many great critics praising a movie where there is so much talent this movie tries to deal with alot and does alot of it well but as a viewer , i am hugely distracted by mamet 's dialogue no , i do not agree that people in the real business world talk like this ! real people do not mindlessly echo over and over and over the same phrases that they hear each other speaking if i did that in my working environment my coworkers would think there was something wrong with me real conversation does not run in that kind of patter after listening to the characters for ninety minutes , i finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was mamet real people talk differently from each other they use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang i 've had this problem with mamet before and i ca n't believe nobody has ever noticed this before and i would doubt that i am the first i would n't be surprised if somewhere some actor in some mamet production has pondered this before come on ! good dialogue is like good acting if it 's really good , you do n't notice it until the show 's over
what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic , maybe , but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i could n't understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage 's character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex , violence , or rough language although cage does get shot in one hold up scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they should n't have changed it so much or they should n't have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together
this is a review of the ultimate collector 's edition , not a review of the film itself if you 're considering the purchase of a two disc special edition , you probably already know that the film is great you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag
old movies are great i 've been waiting for the release of oklahoma ! in the new technology dvd format i wanted to use my new dvd up converter i have the laser disk version , and after reading the reviews , i will keep it until fox gets its act totether fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here until i know it 's at least as good as my outdated laser disk , i 'll wait
do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do , you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring
this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin
this is the worst asian movie that i have ever seen the story is dumb and does n't make any sense , especially the ending and to top it off it is n't that scary it only gets a little bit scary at the end
if this movie was ever going to have a chance , it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long , or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just ca n't be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just was n't time enough , i guess , to develop the characters , or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating , and we are left with painful stereotypes and , in the case of roland michell , a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you 've read the book , skip the movie , but if you saw the movie , you should do yourself a favor and get the book
why release wrestlemaina 's that are already on dvd \? anther thing wrestlemaina is months away , it was a perfect time to release the big four in order survivor series entire series , then royal rumble , then wrestlemaina , and finally summerslam made sense but wwe really doesnt think well sometimes
well , this dvd is pretty bad , like everyone else said it 's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14 , with narration from each character in the background i believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they were n't getting high ratings on the anime series anyway , i did n't buy this dvd , because i have the japanese box set instead , which saved me a lot of i watched each episode , and i must say the only part i liked was the opening and ending theme other than that , there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die hard wolf 's rain fan but , do n't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window i really highly recommend renting this before you buy it , cause otherwise you are wasting your money
what really bothered me about hudsucker proxy capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone , even communist slaves and fascist toady 's under a democratic people yet , hollywood insists on blasting corporate culture , when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest , they are exemplary
i bought this back in october of 2006 can someone who bought it more recently tell me if the sound issues have been fixed \? i returned this item for a refund and wo n't be buying it again until paramount fixes the sound issues parts of the show are very quiet i had to turn the sound up to even make out the dialog then , a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers this happens multiple times per episode repeat this for six hours if i wanted this kind of quality , i 'd just download the episodes off the internet there will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed i do n't know why they ca n't pay someone 5 15 an hour to watch the dvd once before they make 10 million copies
trying to make a film concerning studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea it 's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on from what i understand , the original director 's cut was gutted by miramax before the film was released it and it shows other than mike meyers portrayal of steve rubell , there 's hardly a gay character in sight there 's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake
i guess when any era becomes old enough for the nostaglia craze to hit , we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying case in point the 1950 's were not such an innocent age , and the 1970 's were not that wild
wow , what a bore the old stock footage is uneven and does n't show enough of the truck other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street the song is ok , but once that 's over my son walks away why would a child who loves trucks walk away \? because some guy 's voice \( which sounds like it 's in an echo chamber \) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he ca n't see on the screen what 's on the screen \? more garbage stock footage this looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone 's basement
i own several real wheels movies and thought i would give this one a shot i found the picture quality to be less than i expected and the footage seemed out of date the narration was dull and boring , and the children 's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying i would recommend any of the real wheels series instead of this they never fail to please my 3 1 2 year old truck lover
i'm of the opinion that king 's books rarely translate well into movies , and this is no exception some of king 's work is fantastic , but unfortunately , a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new this falls into the latter category
filming the story of gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio , from warner brothers to bbc the virgin queen still retains her power to enthrall , intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne she was perhaps england 's last true absolute monarch , and certainly one of its greatest , if not most famous
as much as i like paul newman , this movie is very disappointing once you 've seen the far superior film day one the portrayal of oppenheimer and groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people the movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the manhatten project

do n't waste your time i usually give low budget horror a chance and i have an open mind , but this movie is utterly ridiculous
to be fair , the legends of herakles , as they were originally written , have little to do with this movie , but maybe that 's for the best having grown up on superman , batman and the justice league , i have a hard time calling a person like herakles a hero in the original legends , he was a warrior , but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage he also was n't , as far as i can tell , as strong as in this version
this is poorly casted and scripted movie , has only one thing going for it , no annoying chevy chase around to make unfunny jokes , he did not have too , the cast here do that in abundance
this is the first time i have ever purchased a the firm dvd i was really disappointed in this one many of the moves are not properly explained some movements target only one side of the body and they do n't bother having you switch sides to work the other \( really obvious in the salsa style section \) it took a few times of doing to get all the moves right , but even after that it barely raises the heart rate the warm up leaves much to be desired the cool down continues the dance movements but at a slower rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching i am used to denise austin workouts , that are half the length but you actually feel like you did something when you are done not so with this workout at all definately a waste for someone who is n't just starting out
pearl jam seem to be making a comeback witht their live performances at present , but this dvd shows the band at a less than impressive peak
pearl jam used to be good , now they 're just a joke and this dvd shows it
ladder 49 was not the type of film i expected i was hoping for a good , fast paced action flick , which i got for about the first 5 minutes the remainder of the 30 minutes that i watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter 's first days at the station
i have been a huge fan of l m montgomery 's work since i was an eleven year old girl living in the caribbean i 've read and re read , and re read her stories again and again , and ca n't seem to get enough the first two film installments in the anne of green gables story are warm , beautiful , funny , inspiring and moving pieces of work , that are more or less faithful to montgomery 's original novels
american pie an immature , mindless , vapid , boring , blandly disgusting , humor lacking piece of over rated trash packed full of cliches , highschool sterotypes , annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade a douchebags
the lack of liam neeson and raimi 's directing is what ruined this movie for me while mr vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the liam created character and mr drake always has appeal , the movie as a whole needed a much better script it was too predicatble , too phoney
this is one of my favorite romantic comedies it is funny , touching , and has some of my favorite actors in it and it does n't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people !
absolutely unwatchable cliche ridden so silly it 's very nearly offensive it 's like watching one long music video by a b level rapper full of dumb , beautiful women , buff , monkey headed ghetto thugs , and jokey tricked out cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the script is laughable , the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber than butch cassidy and the sundance kid awful
a dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the us and abroad i was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting i enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen , but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target , i think it 's just a shame
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known hollywood cliche in film making i applaud the effort the chicks in this film are happening babes fo sho but there ai n't much to the film but it has some fun to it
ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film
the kit was not worth its price the spatial effect is poor i 've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red blue paper glasses no , i do n't have visual problem , and i rigged up everything correctly
for months , disney advertised this as a 2 disc special edition dvd but at the last minute , that second disc mysteriously disappeared why \? this is false advertising , and if i had my way , disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands it 's unfair to force people who really want a 2 disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a region free player they did this same crap to alice in wonderland , but the other way around uk lost a disc that we have , and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the 2 and 4 disc editions in the us , but not in the uk , and giving fans in the us a 3 disc edition i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world
this movie was so boring and stupid , i turned it off after about 45 minutes maybe i had a poor copy , but i could barely understand what paula prentiss was saying and it was n't because she was under the influence ! i ran it back a few times but still could n't make it out from the other reviewers , it sounds like it got better but , if something does n't grab my attention after 30 minutes , i say forget it
i loved the original movie , and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome wrong wrong wrong ! ! first of all , the child actors were horrible , well the charlie and mike characters were ok , but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp \? he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater , and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
i found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time it 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning the ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion denzel washington did a great job playing the detective and john goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted my recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money buy somthing that has a good plot d is my ratin
i practically fell asleep while watching this tape , the girl doing the exercises is n't even saying anything while she 's doing it it 's a voice over ! also she 's all alone in a blank room all the exercises are basically the same i would suggest mtv pilates it 's a lot more fun
i bought this dvd to replace a worn video from the bbc \( british broadcasting commission \) it was a bit of a shock the original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through it also now has a poor voice over the whole feel of the film has been removed all the pbs and viewers like your rubbish \? where 'd that come from it was totallly funded via the bbc the pbs editions mess up may have been funded by someone else my copy is going free as i wo n't be watching it again
opened the sealed dvd case and get shorty was inside and not the usual suspects i sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement i got a credit , i think not sure i would rather just have the correct movie
i really want to give this piece of garbage a zero actually , i only watched part of one episode , i do n't know if it 's from season one i am a columbo fan , and a detective writer i saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform the platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in ! a toilet with flowers in it he reacts to colds \? i saw a classroom full of kids every one had a cold ! not very realistic kiddie video game pacing , with no proper build up they do n't make stuff for intelligent people anymore ! if you are new to this series , watch some before you buy maybe some of it is ok
some idiot edited this and put two bars on the top and bottom that are part of the video so in you watch this on a laptop or widescreen tv you will also get two bars on this side this means that when you view it , it takes up about 25 35 of the screen with four black bars taking up most of the screen i could not even watch 5 minutes of this complete trash
the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor , but there 's no mystery
honestly , nothing about this show grabs me i'm surprised this show gets such high nielsen ratings every week the writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time but the biggest flaw is the acting it is really laughable me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be horatio caine talks in a slow drawl all the time , saying the stupidest and most obvious things calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating none of the c s i team displays any emotion whatsoever , oh except horatio when he over does it
this is his absolute worst videos , not his best you are missing tons of classic moments such as when doves cry , let 's go crazy , mountains , girls and boys , batdance , partyman , scandalous , automatic , why you wanna treat me so bad \? , sexuality , i wish u heaven , glam slam , anotherloverholenyohead , america , and thieves in the temple this is a crime when is the real dvd coming out
i'm a fan of the 1999 the mummy and was understandably looking forward to this sequel in the summer of 2001 i went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and f x we just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium
charlize theron , her real life boyfriend stuart townsend , and penelope cruz are all nice to look at , and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work , theron having won as osca for her role in monster
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen , no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get not even samuel jackson 's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie horrible awful
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern 's classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch why \? depp 's performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off putting , flat , self absorbed , and finally , one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog not much holidday fun , huh \? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio
this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont , i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it unfortunately , i was wrong
here 's the awful truth
i preface all of my dvd reviews with the following note there are more than enough film reviews on amazon com and , quite frankly , it 's a bit ridiculous a person can scroll through scores pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the dvd if you want to review or discuss a film , go to imdb if you 're reviewing the dvd , speak to the qualities \( or lack thereof \) of the audio and video mention your opinions of the plot , acting , etc but please do n't write an essay !
i did not much enjoy this film , and i did n't find it very clever or funny
i have never been a demi moore fan , but this movie is even worse than i imagined it would be my kids picked it up in the videotheque i decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them demi 's acting is rather passionless , poor and disconnected she looks old too ! she does n't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too after just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in scotland to write a new novel yeah , sure that 's what i would do after losing my only child i probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so after five minutes you do n't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her you can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen and all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly a guy who is alone on an island for years who does n't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it and who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly a mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere i expected a film with supernatural elements , but boy did i get fooled some of the photography and scenery was acceptable , but the cgi generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly alas , not a film that i can recommend to anyone
half light \( craig rosenberg , 2006 \)
i 've owned the laserdisc version of new order story for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week , so i thought having the dvd version would be an upgrade not at all , it 's a cheap transfer from laserdisc the dvd containing a collection has defects in it i mainly bought it so i could have the full version of the promo for the perfect kiss , which in story is almost ruined by bono 's horrible voice but it turns out it has a huge skip in the dvd version i did n't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it
the editor decided that i do n't want to see how the plane crashes into wtc , or how people jump from windows , so , he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else instead , there is a plenty of news people 's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking \( and why do i care \? \) , plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left
this dvd is edited from the original version this movie is hot , the cut dvd is not
seeing what 's become of the rock and roll legends i remember from when we were much younger , i found very depressing i 'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago even jerry lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home
absolute dog poop with corn so there is this joke that all the comedians know about , and there are a million ways to tell it , and they get really raunchy there , that 's the movie i saved you two hours oh but there 's a kicker , the joke is n't funny and everyone knows it yet , of course , some of the comedians tell it like it 's the funniest thing in the world sarah silverman , gilbert godfried , bob sagat , and south park are definite highlights and i love sarah silverman however , the awful cinematography , horrific editing , and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people did n't burn down the theaters when they realized this film was n't getting any better i would have at least demanded a refund , and 100 hr billed in 15 minute increments i think sarah silverman saved the day again
so i'm supposed to believe that the horrible dialogue , bad acting , and ridiculous plotting is on purpose just because mamet is a respected guy \? how about we call a dog a dog and just move on
this show is my all time favorite , however universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser , and a wrong season premier intro !
this documentary is poorly produced , has terrible sound quality and stereotypical life affirming stories there was nothing in here to support wal mart , their business practices or their philosophy
first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan therefore , i tried to like this really , i did
i'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does , i suppose most are simply glad the show is available on dvd however , the transfer to dvd is absolutely horrible on an opening night shot on disc 1 , there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs inside the house ! the colors on these prints are n't even as good as what is shown on tvland this show might be 30 years old , but they cannot be using the best prints available there is another irritating tip off of the cheapness of this package the music on the closing credits is wrong or is this my imagination \?
first let me say that i thought angela 's ashes was an absolutely terrific book and frank mccourt fully deserved his pulitzer prize this movie was a horrendous let down no one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty everything was a hollywood version of suffering and misery , from emily watson 's pretty red coat standing in for the real angela 's gray rag to the beautifully lit irish streets and of course john let me tell you how you 're supposed to feel right now williams' cloying , inappropriate music
this is a made for tv movie and not the original film do not waste your money on this re make buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred robert blake
highly acclaimed that , i knew i watched the first 30 minutes , which is 1 4 of the movie , before i decided to hang it up new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop this upsets the local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate okay can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot \? nope this one 's boring
i saw this movie yesterday thinking it 'd be exciting i sure am glad that i survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie there 's no story line , the acting is pathetic , whoever gave vin diesel the idea that he can act like an earlier reviewer observes it 's about who 's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review
i ca n't give it any less than one star but what the heck , the girls were hot so there 's the one star other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie ! i swear to god ! i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe ! they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job ! even if they just ran around the set yelling 1 , 2 , 3 , potato salad , march ! the dialogue would have been 1000 times better message to the producer
i love chazz p and i can see why he would want to give the other side of the castellano epic , but man is this movie boring castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family if you know the history of this guy , than you should agree , and if you do n't , read some books about him as powerful as he was , he sure did n't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors , which this film does n't portray the film also has terrible actors portraying both sammy the bull and john gotti an insult at that if you like mafia movies and do n't care about the history of its real life characters than by all means watch it if you do , skip it , you 'd be better off reading a book
to violent for anyone ! this movie is horrible the cast is good , but the plot stinks ! its just this family who have super powers then this kid wanted to be mr incredibles side kick \( in a way \) mr incredible says no so then he hates him then the kid turns evil and kills people , and wants every body to like him thats origanal there are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , and there is way to much violence killing , guns , punching , bombs , and they say stupid words sometimes i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence so i do not recommend this movie to anyone especially the 2 disc special edition !
well what can i say about this movie \? well one thing is it was n't what i 'd expected those who 'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but i still wanted to see it i was wrong and they were right
being a huge fan of sandra bullock , i bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work nope , this movie is garbage first thing i noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots the acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous over all , it 's not a movie worth buying
i have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by dhl global mail

well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately the female teenage protagonist \( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here \) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal but that 's why they call them movies when are these post modern writers , artists , and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them , not compete with them men crave femininity in females , not feminism wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut , if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations
having watched great movies in the bible series such as joseph , david , abraham , jacob , moses and samson and delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures , i was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film what a let down by this anachronism how low can one go ! this is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of god
this movie is not very realistic the sets are great ! , but the story is a biblical snafu ! they had the chance to embellish the real story , without compromizing the bible 's account , but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later , which impeached any incredibility it might have had i did n't like it much for that reason
the ring two is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary naomi watts and david dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of samara , the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film however , like any specter worth her salt , samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living

i bought 2 barbie dvd and this is one of them it 's dark and scary at the beginning and the story line is not that great compare with the other one i have \( mermaidia \) it does n't attract my daughter like mermaidia and she does n't like it that much do n't buy this get the mermaidia one
my daughters are not barbie doll fans but they do like the movies so do i
could have been a truly interesting film , just plain simpleminded and annoying
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved \? they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use \? which drugs \? presumably they 're talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let 's not talk about that let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him \? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they do n't even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined \? why do n't they address this \? this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking
if you love hip hop then do n't buy this video it 's a mix of movements that are not hip hop
michael moore filmed this propaganda , partially financed by the united auto workers , to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion , made possible by gm 's unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages , something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes
this is a pretty good collection for the mickey beginner i would n't purchase it however if you already have the walt disney treasures mickey mouse in living color series because all the shorts are on those dvds as well
those who describe this story as cute and joon as quirky are n't paying attention for me , this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity the writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness yes , depp is great , given what he has to work with , but overall i am very sorry that i was subjected to this horribly stupid , insensitive movie
with great music and a setting that reminds you of vampire hunter d it sucks you into watching the series the plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing the animation is good , which is a must have for me , but it was n't enough to redeem the series
i only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the twins really bad acting and plot that makes little sense trying to be like the original movie but falls way short its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters not worth it except for the brief shower scene
i normally praise disney 's animated movies , but i 've got to draw the line somewhere i ca n't believe the average review for this movie was 41 2 stars i found the characters in this movie annoying , even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff i urge you to buy treasure planet , any disney pixar film , tarzan before this one
there are two main reasons why this superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects
what looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment whilst you expect some plot to come together \( at least on first viewing \) it is strung together to confuse even to frustrate the viewer
i was seriously considering purchasing this movie , but luckily i saw it at blockbuster one night and decided to rent it before i made up my mind i think it was the smartest move i 've made in my entire life because this movie turned out to be , not only the worst lesbian movie , but probably one of the worst movies ever made ! the reviews i 've seen for this movie are way too generous i must say believe me when i say that i am not a strict critic i can be easily entertained by the corny ones but this one could not be salvaged , and one star is much more than it deserves the fact that is in black and white can be overlooked , but the bad acting , and pseudo artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school unfortunately , my girlfriend and i were unable to get through the first 30 mins , so i am unable to rate this movie wholly all i can say is please rent it at least
i was really looking forward to movie my goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50 's westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing , these alone did not turn me off from watching my real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting within the first 10 minutes of the movie , a stage coach is robbed , my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors they were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers later , when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them , the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that i laughed as the movie plodded forward , scene after scene left me wondering , how quickly was this thrown together and how come they did n't rehearse more i felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment i generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly , i think it was an embarrassment and waste of time maybe it got better \( that is why i gave it two stars \) but i find that doubtful i am wondering if both tom berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of script writing 101
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star \? sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood , killing , and the like it was totally historically inaccurate , and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow , without even aiming the canon , he knocks his 'friend' off his horse
cinema wise , you know you 're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best hollywood can come up with is a sequel to a remake \( it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film \) but that is exactly what cheaper by the dozen 2 turns out to be and the result , quality wise , is pretty much what one would expect
after reading the novel by jane yolen with my 7th grade classes , i was eager to view the film version i had heard conflicting views of the film it 's great , it 's horrible , etc after viewing it for myself , i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews however , despite its lack luster performance , the film did serve a purpose in the classroom
this is a goody goody ronald reagan propaganda style film by that i mean that it tries to portray the us as the good guys being hit by the bad ones it does n't say what dirty role the us cia had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis islam , how it set up , equipped and nurtured not only bin laden and his al qaeda , but a whole bunch of other loathsome islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe like the islamic brotherhood and the taliban for instance all just to defeat the ussr , and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions , to fuel the greedy american consumerist lifestyle which us citizens take so much for granted i am not a conspiracy theorist these people are usually an absurd breed , going off at the other extreme tangent i live in peshawar , the hotbed of cia mischief in the 1980s and 90s \( and even now \) , and the area where i live the university town housed all the actors on this stage the us officials and spies , their clubs , the afghan mujahideen leaders' houses , etc etc i grew up seeing all this going on literally next door , and so would like to apprise my american friends of the unpleasant truth the national geographic and the reader 's digest magazines are two long established icons of us media culture that have served as the unofficial \( and therefore hard to suspect \) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous us propaganda drives never trust their political commentaries , although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice
personally , i ca n't see this movie for dust in fact , i find it extremely annoying the only video worse than this one is monty python and the holy grail yecch !
i was disapointd in this show it was mad and release by warners \( marvel 's biggest rival and dc 's parent company \) , this new take on the x men had them behave like horny teenage doofuses , and do n't get me started on the crappy writing just like x2 was not the x men , this show was also the same it was in name only , and speaking as the only loyal marvel fan here , that says i all
this movie is just not scary i'm a huge horror movie fan and this movie has no tension in it , no edge of your seat fear i liked the sequel devil 's rejects , but that is n't much of a horror movie either \( unless you think from dusk til dawn is scary \) 1 , 000 corpses is about as scary as hostel it should never be mentioned in the same breath as texas chainsaw , because other than trying to look like a gritty 70 's horror flick , it has nothing in common with chainsaw
in essence , this is a texas chainsaw remake , but here 's the difference , and why it 's far inferior i do n't care one iota for the victims i can barely tell the females apart the guys are so obnoxious , i look forward to them dying unlike texas chainsaw \( parts one and two , horror masterpieces ! \) , this movie shows the psycho family \( hmmm kind of like texas chainsaw \? \) far too much a little goes a long way , too much \? overkill ! many plot holes , and take away the music , there was some really bad acting it gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style , and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed but in general , rob zombie should not get writing credit for this it 's texas chainsaw massacre , only nowhere near as good
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible , horrible film mindless , drawn out banter , and weak story line our copy eventually broke \( stepped on \? \) we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star seems like a generous rating
okay , the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen , but i like the actors \( especially ben 's best man \) so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot , such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones \? or at least , why do n't they use them \? oh no , much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee , he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up \? and uh , they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gonna get busted \?
there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end , whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort , but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film , you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed , the lines could have been written the night before , and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic , the violins would always shrill around kiefer , and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement , no frills , nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films , which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end
this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some well known actors , and a notable director , the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night tv movie with profanity inserted to liven it up
subtitled guy 's mom is sick the guy is also depressed meets a ex hustler on beach they kiss , fight , make up , over and over \( most of the movie \) they break up boy meets hustler 's ex and they play with dog on beach the end
i saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him \( he was seeing it for a second time \) after the first ten minutes , i wanted to leave if you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb american youth from small , hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local wal mart or becoming mince meat in iraq , then this movie is for you ! however , if you like movies that actually challenge you to think , do n't waste your time with this one
this terrible movie has singing ! bad singing , and lots of it ! overacted , trite , and boring ! all those good reviews , i thought it would be campy and cool , but it 's not !
i absolutely abhor this film want to know why \? because it labled 'valley of the dolls' and everything jacqueline susann ever wrote into 'great campy fun' now i do n't know this for certain , but i do n't think jacqueline susann wanted people to see her books as cheesy comedies i think she wanted people to take her work seriously , and with this awfully made film , no one did to others , the film might be so bad it 's funny , but to devoted fans of the book it 's just depressing the movie was made in 1967 , a year after the book was published and you can see that jacqueline susann was ahead of her time , because the film is poorly adapted and very censored you know you have a problem when the book would receive an r rating if transferred onto the screen , but the movie is only rated pg besides the sex scenes , language , pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out , important details to the plot are also missing anne 's hatred of lawrenceville , helen lawson 's screen time , jennifer 's complicated and somewhat absuive relationship with tony , allen and gino cooper , henry 's character development , jennifer 's relationship with the senator \( and the reason she committs suicide \) , the tragic ending , etc are all either missing or are shortened down i do n't care if the movie would have been almost three hours long , i think if they had stuck close enough to the book , then everything would have been fine what a shame and please do n't mention the casting of actors save for patty duke , i thought everyone else did a horrible job some of the actors did n't even look the physical part \( in the book anne is actually a blonde , helen lawson has dark hair and jennifer is curvy \) the thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade \? it 's almost forty years later , and i think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation how about kate bosworth as anne welles , scarlett johansson as jennifer north , keira knightly as neely o'hara , joaquin phoenix as lyon burke , and liza minnelli as helen lawson \? well i doubt that will ever happen , so in the meantime i recommend reading the book instead , and taking it seriously the way jacqueline susann had intended it to be
nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else \? the songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals , which arguably were n't that bad \( what a girl wants and get this party started were fairly tame to begin with \) just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds
this is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film 's deeping meaning i am sure that i missed much of that meaning however , one aspect of it is painful clear the crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation i found that premise disturbing and unrealistic also , it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex if so , this movie could contribute , in a small way , to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof
simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin \( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince \( why \? \) \) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so , a kid dies , which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around , why , no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship
the premise that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i do n't condemn the film 's corollary either that each change produces new , unforseeable tragedies it 's the way the story is told its ham fisted dialogue and plot , its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities
you only need to read the book by whitley strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is
since we know there is another version of burn out there , i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes com and get an idea of its quality you can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan , poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued brando told larry king it was his favorite film not if he saw this package
read the amazon editorial review , they are tiptoeing around saying this movie does n't really work
there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound , then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash , but at least that was \( somewhat \) assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours , and as much as i \( usually \) enjoy george clooney , i might never forgive him for this drek
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally , i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch
this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery
in the early 1990 's this movie was definitely made for that era just look at the clothing and hair high top fades etc graffiti bridge was definitely unique it should have been released on cable t v instead of the theater it was more of a musical then a actual movie prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world and he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out , but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing the talent he has is amazing but he 's become just a mediocur artist this lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now but as of now it 's just what you call a get up and walk out film i'm a prince fanatic , a die hard fan , but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet you haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate if only prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet i think he shut the world out and it just went on turning record sales may not matter to him , but fans you must keep loyal graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and i just look at it as my collection but nothing more it 's a film that makes you think it 's spiritual and there are some warm moments now purple rain is something not to be missed i recommend that one enjoy
oh man , this is really \( \) ! ! !
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here , years later , when i'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
i recently purchased this dvd and was beyond disappointed with it i actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it i expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there , with the firemen , or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent i can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it 's hard to make out the film has a few comments by the person taping it but that 's it the film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble i found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom i own several other documentaries that i watch over and over as i do n't want to forget the feelings i felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country this dvd was a huge waste of both my time and money
like other reviewers , i found meetthe parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for 25 bin at hollywood so i figured why not \?
i 'll cut to the meta chase since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews
yes , this is a supernatural psycological thriller but far from a good one as far as i'm concerned
sit down under a tree , give it a big hug , fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs !
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout , i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it , but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this , but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
i saw this movie for the first time , and i found out that it is very very violent and i laughed at some good parts , but the scene where amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese 's wing is not what you want your kids to see
the dvd is really a deception all the experts invited are the ones that support gnostic theory i was hoping that i can see a balanced view related to this subject instead , i only see the point of view of the pro dan brown 's experts i think we should invite the famous evangelists , theologists , and scholars from the protestant , cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue the dvd does not even discuss why the gnostic theory was rejected in the first century
sat down and saw this one on televion
period dramas are , by definition , delicate commodities they 're balanced on that , ahem , razor 's edge between high brow and just plain fussiness
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
this is not a good movie ! bad acting , story , and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it
i really enjoy both nathan lane matthew brodderick i'm a marginal fan of will ferrell \( in this movie , i thought he was way over the top \) and it seems , nothing in this movie musical really gels
the biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions witch hunter robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime i did n't like it i found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so that 's it \? ' ending i hated
hi folks ,
i made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars \( 4 \) it received from other viewers the plot was butchered , the characters twisted , the story ruined , a pure agony
i 'll be right up front and admit that i do not own this dvd i hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact but then i realized that if you 're reviewing a dvd , 90 of the review must be based on the movie itself , and having saw the movie when it was released , and having seen it again on the various cable channels , i felt i could write a respectable reveiw
this series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12 year old , but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters most of the plot 's famous unpleasantness is just tacked on to the main story , and is of no significance
alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority the character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by aristotle watching this movie you get the feeling that alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident
how do you spell 'sucks' \? easy a l e x a n d e r !
great movie the problem is in the medium of delivery there are 2 dvds in the package each dvd contains approximately 1 2 of the movie the audience customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd
the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good in fact , it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we do n't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor \( the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates \) she was , however , but we the audience do n't know that however , the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam , is unexplained , especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin , however it turns out she is n't , so that 's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes fortunately , we 're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies , either , so this does n't turn into a soap opera however , we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped , and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that 's true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable , being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film , 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character , and it 's his story we 're following , whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film , and basically it 's her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out , and everyone else \( in a way , the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement \) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth , though the characters do n't have the same truth in mind it 's about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it 's not the comic book variety , is n't fun for an audience , it 's just distasteful in other words , the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves , and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment \? we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story , so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved , it might be worth viewing , if only once , but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that 's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip , or in this case deliberate lies , is that what goes around comes around , and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first 30 45 min then quit midway , but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once , just to be sure where this is headed
this movie is one of the 3 worst movies i 've ever seen
this tepid , disappointing sequel is far better than beyond the re animator but dose n't equal a good sequel to the excellent original dr herbert west and his friend dan re animate dead bodies and when dan 's girlfriend is dying she is re animated just like bride of frankenstein the gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along the new director brian yuzna does a good job taking over stuart gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a sci fi channel movie that would debut on tv and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast \( except jeffrey combs and bruce abbott \) , lower production values and lower budget , and tepid to atrocious acting if you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of beyond the re animator
there is one thing i finally grasped upon watching 'the 40 year old virgin' , however i came to the realization that hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique \( 'the 40 year old virgin' \) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas
one of the most overrated comedy shows ever basically the calibre of a high school talent show in a way it reminds me of tom goes to the mayor , seemingly fitting into a comedy niche i do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever , but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird i 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head i think these guys took that a bit too much to heart maybe the fans see some subtle naunces i'm missing , but to me it seems like i could have written most of this material with little effort
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portraying
i recently purchased the first house movie , i remember watching it as a kid , it was apparently alot scarier during my adolesence , anyways the second one came with it for free , and i must say it was garbage , i did not have the patience to sit thru this crap , i now use this dvd disc as a cup coaster peace
i was a fan of house \( the first of the series \) and so purchased the combo dvd set of house and house 2 i watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while house is pretty good , house 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on it is really quite dumb , but some of the creatures \( i e catter dog as i like to call him \) are kind of fun to see i would suggest skipping the second house unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be
the beginning is very well done , then the only interesting parts are the cat and mouse between jude law and ed harris the rest of the film is bad , i 'd say luckily , i recorded it from tv it is now erased \( by the way , one of the amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that bob hoskins is american he 's from england
this was the most obnoxious time waster i have ever witnessed i kept waiting for the monty python troup to show up the acting was horrid what was with the rocks and urinating on the door \? \? i found myself rooting for grendel of the 33 people in the theater , 10 got up and left half way through this was a story of great heros , not neurotic children too bad gerard butler 's career has come to this i hope the beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview i would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work
for a topic this edgy , this is an incredibly dull film the actors are good enough , mind you but they can only do so much , because the real problem with this film is the script for the first twenty minutes or so of screen time , the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother \( you might not pick up on that fact at first , since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film certainly the two look nothing alike \) finally the main part of the plot begins , with natalie just as discontented , despite being married to a wealthy and quirky but ultimately nice guy \( alan rickman , for whose sake i watched this film at all not worth it \) , and with her brother seemingly happy with his life , but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister from that point , things spiral no , that 's too dynamic a word to describe it mosey out of control , with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair , the poor brother \( the only particularly sympathetic character in the film \) becoming obsessed with the relationship , and the worried hubby 's suspicions growing \( although not in the right direction \) there 's so much here that could have been fascinating and compelling , but is n't , on any level the plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi believable situation , scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet this video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops mercifully for the public but i certainly would n't recommend resorting to buying it
i was n't impressed by this film first of all , i could never buy that saskia reeves and clive owen were a brother and sister nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother sister relationship they might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems , because that 's how the relationship came across
this dvd is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost the film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes the acting is hopeless really , really bad ! although there are many soldiers involved in the battle scenes , it 's all pretty unconvincing , considering the carnage of the real conflict in all honesty , as much as i enjoy movies of the civil war , i 'd like to return this for a refund alas , that 's a prospect that has , indeed , gone with the wind thumbs down to this one
stick with ted turners gettysburg , what can i honestly say about this work of fluff nothing
first off , i am a huge pixar fan in november in '95 i took my company to see toy story and within 6 months of that showing i got rid of most of the employees that did n't like the film i 've seen every pixar film at least 5o times nuff said
these dvd 's are a joke if you want the original full length movies on dvd go on ebay you will find versions copied from laserdisc they are in widescreen , digital quality , original audio and full length they are superior to the old vhs copies and much better then these new dvd 's
this movie is laughable today it 's very dated , and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so , but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards , it appears like a low budget flick
well , my title says it all there is nothing special or amazing about this movie i do n't like the three main actors , and the ending was just laughable sorry , but it was a stupid movie
you , me and dupree is a formula film , a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth , noisy , crude guy things movies there have been a lot of these films of late \( all spinoffs of the wedding crasher image \) and one wonders if there is a saturation point
here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i could n't believe what i was watching ! moreover , i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on \? is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about \? am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain \? where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema 's most tedious and overrated
this movie is a rehash of the first , but it is a crappy , unconvincing , emotionally uninspiring movie
after seeing the real show in l a , my girlfriend and i were really looking forward to the dvd and after last night 's viewing , i went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that i did n't like the whole thing that much i'm relieved to see that other fans just could n't handle all the audience shots either this dvd tries so hard to define paul 's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know , feel , and live it they tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it if you 're from mars and this is your first day on earth , you might appreciate the way the dvd attempts to explain the relevance of paul 's work if you 've been on this planet for awhile , chances are you 're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music
this really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book , if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out , and i accept that , but to completely change the ending is not excusable what was wrong with the way the book ended \? like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them \( even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world \) if you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy , its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback , if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape

i consider myself a huge pixar fan this is easily the most insipid pixar movie ever pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one i have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie pixar , if you are listening , please , please , dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c grade stuff i expect more from you

the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i wo n't bore you with the list
if you have read \( and enjoyed \) any of the x men , save your , buy the graphic novel of the original dark phoenix saga , and pretend this movie was n't made if you want to see some special effects are n't that hung up on character development , i 'd still just rent it
saw this movie at the actual premier in nyc and met sturla gunnerson and i told him exactly how i felt gerard butler needed a bigger horse i expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater sarah polleys language was uncalled for in the film they could have written better lines the fade in , fade out was like a child filming with a video camera the film was funny at times and mixed with gore like eating sweet and sour being a gerard butler fan i was distressed after watching this film why did he do this \? gerry butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes this unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like the jury , please or the phantom of the opera i expect mr butler to be past these b films and know he does have much better stuff in the works than goodness
the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting how does a man trained as a 'killing machine' integrate back into society yes , it 's been done before but still holds promise the plot was adequate
i am a big fan of kurt russell but this movie sucks and as forrest gump said , thats all i have to say about that
growing up , i absolutely loved the turtles but this dvd stinks the only plus is that i can have the original episodes in convenient dvd form rather than track down a bunch of old vhs tapes this dvd is no different from the season one and season three dvd's they all have spelling errors and title errors and each one seems to have been produce in a half a fashion just to capitalize on the new turtle's sucess which by the way the new turtles are much better than the old ones on the season three dvd the package refers to bebop as bebob , nice editing job i guess it was to hard to get that one right also all three of the dvd's are bare bones with no special features the price does however reflect the crappy job the studio did on this most of these dvd's can be purchased for around 10 bucks i just wish that peter laird had the rights to the old show so that it could have been done some justice on dvd
unfortunatly this dvd set is defective on disc 1 episode 3 the picture just freezes and then loops back to the opening scene i sent one back to amazon then got a replacement and had to send that one back as well so i thought maybe the ones at the store might not be defective so i bought a copy at target and it 's the same problem ! i 've written to anchor bay twice and they have n't bothered to reply this situation really angers me because i love this season but am not going to waste money on a defective product do n't buy this dvd until the problem is resolved ! ! ! !
i got this movie on sale a couple years ago it looked pretty good , but you know how most of that goes i really lke movies like scream , i thought it would be like that , but nope this movie was a hundred percent perdictable i knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie from the first seen you can tell it 's gonna suck spoiler the first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway , when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out the lights flicker \( wow how original \) and a person in a really , really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax this is what happens throughout the entire movie do n't waste your time or money if you really want to see it i would suggest renting it not worth more than 3 00 anytime
i guess i expected more out of this movie but i confess i was mildly disappointed in it at first , the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling still , it was a great cast dean martin was particularly adept at westerns , much more so than frank sinatra , who pretty much plays frank sinatra in this one it is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies , in this case , anita ekberg and ursula andress the bad guys are well represented by victor buono and charles bronson a fun movie but not particularly memorable
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by 9th gate this film is tepid , there is none of the satanic intensity ambiance that you find in 'rosemary 's baby' it 's too hollywood , surprisingly , considering the maverick presence of depp polanski film opens well , with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence , but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 , which i was equally disappointed in , at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it , but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball , considering he was the producer director co screenwriter , and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible , so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film , rent it only buy angel heart instead
ok , basquiat , at age 19 see the actual person period \( so wonderfully played by wright in movie basquiat \) what a major trainwreck of film this is should have stayed where it was buried sorry , wo n't waste my time to list all the many , very many reasons , already wasted my money
i recently discovered this set available on dvd and was very excited , since i 've been a fan of david suchet , agatha christie and hercule poirot for a long time i was really looking forward to viewing these , however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it did n't get better the image quality is actually worse than what i 've seen on aired on television via cable the picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines , which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore i'm amazed acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it i will definitely not buy any other titles by acorn media
the first set was very entertaining a spy crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by moore and curtis set ii is another kettle of fish altogether the second set is strictly played for laughs there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin frankly , i hoped for more
this is a documentary about adhd not half japanese most of the so called critics ca n't remember a dambed thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of jad while continuously ranting about their major label conspiracy theories penn jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homless person out of jad 's material and then threatened jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy if you 're interested in mental illness and sleazy people like penn jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this if you 're interested in a great american rock band then just buy the albums and listen
\( 1 \) scarlett o'hara is the least likable heroine i 've ever seen she has no redeeming qualities
a poorly conceived , poorly put together mess do n't bother
let me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film , make your own decision as to if you will purchase it this is simply my opinion of the film this movie has horrible fight scenes that do n't appear to be martial arts at all basically , van damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities , and forces him into a stiff choreographed position they found some buff guys , okay , big deal they put them in a film , and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills these guys do n't have that vin diesel has far better choreography by himself i have said this about other films and i will say it about this one as well the cast crew benefited from the production of this film , so it doesnt affect them they go home happy believing they did a good job you , the consumer , you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it wrong move as for this film you will waste money that could have been put into your retirement , or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves save that money and put it where it belongs this is not worth your cash
this is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war , geopolitics and weapons trade there is almost no dialogues
i am confused does anyone know who owns this dvd whether this chinese film the road home is in french audio only for this sony dvd \? it 's not in mandarin , cantonese or any other chinese dialect \? the answer will determine whether i buy it or not
maybe i'm spoiled by big budget sci fi films , but i thought this movie kind of stunk it felt and looked like a tv movie and was n't scary , at all the best funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady 's name or face , and everyone described her the same way the one with the glasses oh , her have n't seen her lol
okay , this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans
this is not a collection of the superbowls , played from start to finish , as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe i got this for my father so he could watch the 49ers tromp all over the broncos over and over again \( since they certainly have n't been up to much lately ! \) unfortunately , all we got was a collection of highlights , with so many up close and personal shots , that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen tv an expensive disappointment , surely
dubbed and renamed see the original swordsman ii instead
wuthering heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion , betrayal , madness , despair , greed , hatred , and revenge it 's not necessarily a pleasant read , but always an engrossing one emily bronte 's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you 've finished the book

i'm not sure what everyone else watched , maybe i was expecting to much after reading these other reviews , but i was more than just a little disappointed the women are attractive that is for sure , but that 's the only thing this movie has going for it the sex footage was over before is started at the most they lasted about 30 seconds i'm not looking for hard core porn , but this was far from what i was looking for my suggestion is 'buyer be aware'
20 years ago , there was a terrible accident in the mine on valentine 's day the following year one of the miners , harry warden , takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident since that day , there is no celebration of valentine 's day in the little town valentine 's buff until now \( that is 1981 \) but harry warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration
are you kidding me ! \? this movie is beyond all redemption sean conery is a disgrace to himself , running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on wtf ! what 's with all the naked women in this thing \? why do they have to be naked \? they 're hideous looking in the face and body my god , my eyes ! if this is the product of the love generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating , no wonder our society is crazy i just ca n't get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are , it 's downright insulting to the human brain whoever wrote this and was crazy enough to finance it , should be killed and then studied so we do n't have another idiot of this caliber spawned
this is the worst version of 'wuthering heights' i have ever seen please , if you are a fan of emily bronte 's classic , do n't waste your time on this movie i do n't know how anyone could try out for a part in a movie without reading the book it was based off of first \( none of the actors read the novel \) instead , try seeing the 1939 or 1992 version , they are worth your time and money
i first saw the movie poster and was n't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler but then i heard composer alan menken \( who had worked on beauty the beast and aladdin \) was attached and this made me rethink my position then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before still , i went into the movie theater ready to give home on the range a chance
i'm a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily too heavily on her charm and unfortunately , it is some of her worst acting work , posey , sing song , and superficial now , if you 've read her bio , and know what was going on with her and holden , that could explain it , but still , this film is very static
actually not going to be kind what a load of rubbish
i have four kids , boys and girls , ages 3 to 8 we all love hot wheels , world race we previewed the first acceleracer movie , and were very disappointed ! i agree that perhaps it is targeted to some older kids , but that leaves a void for the younger ones why do the characters have huge , unnatural feet and arms \( not to mention lani 's breast augmentation \) \? lani now looks like a streetwalker , taro \( my favorite \) like a cheap hood , and what happened to marky \? the themes have turned dark , the behavior \( street racing , violence , nastiness \) provides an incredibly poor example a movie that was very safe and innocuous has turned into a minefield for my children i disagree with some reviewers that the kids do n't pay attention to those parts we will not let our kids watch this trash ! my kids and their parents are mystified at why such a good thing was allowed to go so far down we told them it is rated pg \( i agree with that reviewer \) and they might watch it when they are older parents beware do not trust materials marked for children to necessarily be appropriate
funniest movie i 've ever watched i think i busted a rib laughing
i returned this as i found out it was either letterbox or wide screen format , i only buy or want tapes or dvds that fill the entire tv screen , otherwise i dont buy the
making it no reason to even consider getting this filler filled p o s
i was told this was hilarious cheech and chong and so many others not only were theye barely there , i must have missed the funny part i wish i 'd missed the whole movie do n't bother
i am a bbc devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic bbc storytelling and visual feasting however , i was only partially correct it is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly i left the film feeling robbed , disappointed , sad , and a bit unfulfilled i viewed it only once and then sold it on e bay at a cut rate price
what a disappointment ! every time it gets hot , it cuts straight to the end the movie is entirely foreplay ! !
while i have not purchased this box set i have seen many of the episiodes several times as i am a fan of spongebob allthough he and patrick can be a bit pathetic at times for example , in the idiot box when they order a tv just to play in the box anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out just one bit of the episiode just one bite which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor you all know it so there 's no need for explanation i think it 's so pathetic that certain scene 's in cartoons have to be snipped out
this film was not what i expected it was so plain i was about ready to turn it off
i bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through some chapters , i watch several more times
do n't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like i did the earlier artisan release is still much better than this special edition the image is better and also the sound i do n't know what lions gate thought they were doing , but remastered \? no i compared both several times before writing this even though i only had to compare once might as well wait for a hd dvd to come out , this is a waste unless you want the additional features
an average customer review of almost 4 stars \? have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia \? jason supposedly went to hell yeah \? then why is still in one piece this time round , the government realise there 's nothing they can do to stop jason and have him captured he is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm unfortunatley , he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space ! yes space ! the budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good there may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it 's just not enough ! this sequel sounds more like a star trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good friday the 13th flick supposedly , a twelfth friday the 13th movie is being made \( if you count the excellent freddy vs jason \) while freddy vs jason was indeed impressive , there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore
i am a recovering alcoholic with 19 years of continuous sobriety
the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love
i own over 250 dvds , with a huge mixture of types this is the worst movie for this year i 've seen so far what a waste of my time go ahead and see it , but i do n't recommend it
let me break it down for you in a nutshell , people it 's a murder mystery in which the film 's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is but , she has her doubts but she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy 's arm he has the same thing but what does she do \? she has sex with him sex , sex , and more sex if you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him \? plus , 50 of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk i do n't think this was a perfectly planned movie , to tell you the truth
alright take a step back , and tell me there is n't something decidedly wrong , even militantly spooky , about the american southwest
so i thought i only saw pieces of the abc presentation of desperation on tv i thought i missed the chapter about the first family , david 's family , and how they came to be in the town jail it turns out i did n't miss anything , that 's the way it was filmed when i heard the film was available on dvd and r rated , too , i vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen curses , gore , adult scares and , perhaps a booby ! one would n't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on abc but the r rated version , oh boy !
this review might contain some spoilers i was disappointed with this anime after all the reviews i read i was expecting alot more it was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over there was some humor but all in all i would not waste money on it infact , i took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after i purchased it
boring , boring , boring what a let down ! it 's dated and just not good it was torture sitting through this
the voice over sounds like the guy from the hoky motivational videos everyone had to watch in high school this is an overly sentimental piece of sh t some , and only some , of the visuals are really incredible \( the tow in scenes \) the rest is a feel good , surfers are awesome waste of time i love to surf for my own reasons it 's not because i need to feel like a part of a big community for authentic , thought provoking surf films , check out thicker than water , brokedown melody and september sessions save step into liquid for the people who fall all over themselves for the next predictable hollywood offering
we bought several different potty training videos and this was , unexpectedly , the worst the reason it lacks focus it comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids , or at least do n't remember what potty training is all about
this experience was totally unsatisfactory ! ! ! i received a notice that the product had been shipped it included a very long number to trace the shipment it was promised for february 6th , but did not arrive on february 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made now which is it \? did you have it , and misplace it in the process , or did you lie when you said it was already send out \? i have had otherwise good results in my purchases from amazon , but this is a real mess up i wrote to ask how to reorder , and this is the only response since then is there anything you can do to change this problem \? do you reprint reviews of your service
sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west sure there were some noble men and victimized young chinese girls , but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie i do not find very graphic violence , nudity , and rape on the top of my must watch list i skipped to the ending on the second disk
one of the worst films of a generation many talented comedic \( dave thomas colleen camp \) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral
who in the hell gave this movie the green light \? god awful performances and such immature jokes that only a child can laugh at this may perhaps be the worst movie ever created and i'm the kind of person that appreciates anything but this this is just pure , 100 crap this will most likely be the only time i will ever say i want my two hours back and mean it
peter sellers as well as peter o'toole and all the beautiful women capucine , romy schneider , etc , make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60 's was really that world that mad \? of course ! you could n't stand life without a psychonalist thus , the film reflects precisey that the lack of self confidence , the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade , till happy ending , of course o'toole and schneider get married and lived happily everafter and everybody has surpassed their personal crises good for the movie the humour is just wonderful i recommend it most enthusiasticall
the year 1965 the cast peter sellers peter o'toole woody allen ursula andress the soundtrack burt bacharach tom jones dionne warwick manfred mann the movie believe it or not terrible really as in unwatchable \( other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits \) painfully unfunny slapstick routines , actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards , and no plot to speak of not even fun to watch for 60 's camp value like the party or casino royale i had to turn it off at about the halfway mark
i am a big fan of woody allen and i presume that i will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies prior to viewing what 's new pussycat \? , i would have presumed that i would enjoy each and every movie however , what 's new pussycat \? has shown me that even woody allen can make a disaster movie
i am still awaiting receiving dora the explorer meets diego i have ordered it twice once before christmas and kept updating my order to ship when received and then i ordered it later and canceled the original order because it looked like it was available and then i got a delay again if you have any update on when this will be in and shipped i would really like to know everything else that i have odered and has come from toys r us through amazon i have been very pleaase with
throughly dismisses all jazz after 1960 , including fusion , free jazz , and everything thereafter marsalis actually calls cecil taylor 's music self indulgent bullsh apparently taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film how was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual \( but more likely agenda driven \) on pbs , i will never understand if you think swing is the only valid form of jazz , you will love this series if you think coltrane is a god , you get five minutes' summary so lets see here 15 hours on louis armstrong and duke , 5 minutes on coletrane , and a total didmissal of everything after duke 's death reminds me of the republisuck 's fair and balanced nonsense pbs , this is your wake up call stop trying to rewrite history jazz ai n't in a museum just ask the artists \( most of whom are alive \) whom burns left out metheny , you out there
i had to watch it in my 8th grade pe class and it is very informative and somewhat graphic it shows the scariness of it and makes you eat for one thing ! you wont ever forget it
do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance it is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come the writing is atrocious , and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue , they are completely unbelievable the story is utterly predictable , though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots , and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel it does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency , with terrible editing , pathetic sound , and blatant continuity problems take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile the bbc has made many better mini series , and pretty much any one of them would be preferable
next to a night at the roxbury \( another will ferrell zero \) this is the worst movie i 've ever seen so maudlin and it dragged on and on and on it could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so i guess it has some authenticity brad pitt 's particularly bad one facial expression \( blank \) and a painful monotone delivery i think he got some award aptly represented by a carved wooden statue of keanu reeves mr brangelina jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like anthony hopkins bottom line this movie stinks and so \( ironically \) does pitt
metropolis , fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece , is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one ! but over the years , this film has been reedited , recut , and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker since its stay on the public domain shelf , the prints and image quality have over the years been poor i do not recommend the following versions 1 the goodtimes video release has poor image quality and even worse , no musical score ! 2 the now notorious madacy dvd , which is about 5 times as worse as the goodtimes video release , contains horrible , blurry image quality , freeze frame opening titles , and an annoying musical score ! just recently , tcm \( turner classic movies \) has broadcast the brand new , beautifully restored 2002 restoration of metropolis which i taped off of and trust me , it 's well worth it ! buy the kino restored version on either vhs or dvd , but do not buy the horrible public domain versions which can definitely rip you off ! a terrific film and thanks to kino for making this restored version a definite must see ! i also recommend the 1984 rerelease by giorgio moroder \( which is now unfortunately out of print \) and buy the soundtrack to go with it
can someone please tell me where to get the re mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles \? the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio , or english audio , but no english subtitles !
if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews , you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good \( not great \) acting jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent well not all of the time , since her accent seems to come and go the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has skip it unless you really , really , really love jessica lange
this video is boring too much talking and too little talking from the muppet characters might be suited more for an older child but mine is 13 months so there has to be constant colorful characters for her to be interested
of course the criterion collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer the problem is the film itself
i love stargate , and give the movie 5 stars i own a vhs copy , and have watched it many times
this movie was so stupid , everyone listens to nina when she is clearly messing with their lives they are stupid enough to believe her , and well i do n't even know what else happens cause i saved myself and changed the channel
what a disappointing purchase this was ! i have never purchased a dvd set that was this bad in quality without it being pirated actually , i 've seen vhs copies with better audio video quality if i had not purchased the set from amazon itself i would have thought , i did get a cheap bootleg the sound is a bit flat , which i could deal get over , but the picture quality is just horrendous ! all of the episodes are grainy , pixilated , and some even blur a bit there are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on it 's a waste of money to buy dvd 's like this shame on fox for releasing them this bad !
his girl friday is an ok movie about newspaper reporters in the early part of the 20th century i think it was supposed to be funny , and it may have been at the time , but most of the dialog was lost on me
the simple truth is , this movie is boring yes , it has a really long \( not to say interminable \) rape scene in it , and yes , some guy gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher but so what \? it 's still boring we just sort of drift around from moment to moment , through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes , backwards through the story , which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact then it 's over and you get to do something more interesting , like shine the silverware do n't get me wrong , i like dark and disturbing films \( texas chainsaw massacre , anyone \? \) , but i prefer them to at least be interesting and involving i 'd take anything david cronenberg ever made over this , and i'm including the early stuff
warning spoilers opening scene is quite shocking some graphic effects there is more male nudity and male genitalia than female there is only one quick very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning , or end of the movie since the movie begins with the ending scene and ends with the opening scene the rape scene is violent , with graphic language obviously actual penetration is achieved \( anal \) but none shown not even a good boob shot you of course see the male genitalia \( big deal \) !
pass on this one the original was ok , but if you want great music , great dancing , awesome sets , truly celtic even with the huge ego of michael flatley , who is , by the way an extraordinary talent , buy his show feet of flames totally toe tapping awesome this will be no disappointment like the so called best of riverdance it has no spanish dance , no spirituals , no hip hop , no russian dance all well and good for many but feet of flames is totally irish celtic , whichever you want to call it emma killingbeck scots irish to the cor
peter segal 's anger management is a film with nothing going for it it is best described as boring , annoying , and devoid of laughs
i really hate how all these exercise videos are repackaged and called something different it 's damn confusing
in the annals of criterion this has to be one of their most bloated , pointless offerings this film is just ridiculously bad , not fun , just kind of depressing to see so much wasted effort on such a pathetic script if you really want to watch 1960s willis o'brien inspired stop motion animation watch anything by harryhausen and call it good equinox works only as a curiosity or mystery scince theater 3000 fodder
i like air supply songs this dvd is a big disappointment sound quality could have been better
movie has a lot of cursing , and nudity as well i was very disappointed because i thought the reviews made it sound like i could show it to high school students
robert groden suggests that the zapruder film of the kennedy assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of kennedy in my opinion , his evidence is shaky at best groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who really shot kennedy , and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by abc , cbs , and many books groden needs to finally realize that the kennedy assassination has been solved definitively , and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash cow alive
this is not about riverdance
please do not waste your time or money on this much hyped piece of trash not only is harvey walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant , he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video unlike other excercise gurus , he does not exercise with you , instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands the production quality is very low budget it looks like it was shot using a camcorder the set is bland and melancholy , and there is no music ! all you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers , who display no enthusiasm at all and , i for one , ca n't blame them i only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them i was never more bored in my life walden 's cuing is off , and furthermore , it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you that 's just crazy what was he thinking \? i have no words to describe how awful this video is i wish i could give it 0 stars do n't waste your money please ! ! ! ! the other reviewers must be new to exercise because i ca n't understand how they could n't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect if you want a high powered , energizing , effective calorie burning workout you will not like this video at all you will be sorely disappointed for sure instead try kathy smith 's peak fat burning or any one of her step workouts
the only thing worse than seeing this movie is the fact that it plays automatically all over again when it 's over this is a glorified music video of horrible music jim carey should not be on the cover of this movie either , as he is in about 15 to 20 of the whole thing they should have had whoever the musical artist was i honestly do n't even know the plot of this movie , and i'm not kidding i laughed so hard out loud when i had to read the back of the dvd case to remember what it was supposed to be about the sound \? they interlaced two songs \( one in your right speaker , one in your left \) that do n't even match if you want an idea for a good movie , read the back of this dvd case , and follow that plot , as the director sure steered clear of it alan thicke i thought i knew ye ! oh , and i gave it one star only because i could n't find the give me my money back option
the acting was stiff and vapid , the filming was grainy and amateurish , the story was non existent a good rx for insomnia , this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality seeing young jim carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role
poor lindsay lohan it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life , she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off as an actress , she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft as a child actress , she was a natural fit for her spate of disney appearances , with freaky friday her crowning achievment however , as a young adult , the pressure is much higher , as is the bar of success and movies like this are not helping
i liked this movie but i also did n't like it
every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor actress in it that everything will turn out good blue steel is one of those movies jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties \( or should i say murders \) which she did not commit sounds like an interesting plot , right \? it would be had the script not been so poorly written the supporting actors give such a bland typical performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue aside from the acting , the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop \( jamie lee \) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her so why do i give blue steel an extra star \? well , i 'll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television just do n't pay over 3 to rent it and certainly do n't buy it
this is just like an updated b movie from the sixties and i enjoyed it it 's real comic book stuff the effects are not bad , the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it 's easy viewing i enjoyed this more than big budget films such as evolution or jurassic park 3 but i think the absence of big names will put people off , not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job and if big names do n't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this
i love adam sandler well , i used to love him , before he made eight crazy nights not only was this cartoon not funny , it was downright trash i would not recommend this feature to anyone eight crazy nights was short on story , long on time , and wearing on patience i kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself i needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that i will never get back needless to say , i stuck it out until the credits , and now i have to live with the facts that i 1 \) watched the movie and 2 \) i 'll never get that time back so now i sit here , typing away a review i doubt anyone will read , wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie ! humbug ! watch ishtar , you 'll get more out of it oh , and i only awarded one star because amazon insists you give everything at least one star i did this under protest
death tunnel began with promise early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals , wonderful music , and a good feel them the actors opened their mouths and death tunnel fell apart
to enjoy citizen kane , you have to be able to answer the question above i just hate almost everything about this film i think it 's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep many people will fall for it but it 's very hard to make a truly great film !
this is not a movie , in a classic sense this is a set of interviews of dj 's amp promoters i'm fine with that however the djs that participates are not the best representations of the electronic industry where is paul oakenfold , paul van dyk , sasha , digweed , dave seaman , deep dish , dj dan and countless other famous dj 's \? i understand that the budget might have been too small to invite one of those dj 's mentioned above for an interview or so but in this movie there are lots of dj 's that are not that well representative of an industry that 's becomming smaller and smaller for your money 's worth , buy a breakbeat dance video where you will be more entretained than a documental wanna be
first off , let me say that this is a great collection of really bad sci fi movies the selection spans several sub genres of the classic sci fi age you 've got gamera movies , hercules movies , outer space movies the whole gamut
bearing in mind that the 50 movie pack line is what it is , no frills packages of public domain films , i have to say that sci fi classics is not up to the level of mystery classics and horror classics , which i also own i 've watched everything in the mystery and horror sets , and , while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former , i did n't feel cheated by either moreover , some of the films included , such as detour , impact , bluebeard , and too late for tears , actually are classics of a sort , deserving of repeated viewings
kiefer sutherland stars in `dead heat' a crime drama in which the star of hit tv series `24' can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with he plays pally , 35 year old boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem , and his acting is very good overall , however , there is not much that i can recommend in `dead heat' except some nice touch in showing the characters the film tries to include as many things as possible , but few of them really materialize
delmer daves' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film the robe starring richard burton a totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay , direction , acting , or historical accuracy of any sort avoid at all costs unless you 're expecting to see it as a comedy
yeeouch ! think i spit on your grave with a very good art director audition for the lolita set if you feel kevin bacon got off too easy in the woodsman , or you enjoy sitting through entire law and order svu marathons on tnt , this film has something for you everyone else be advised to stay far , far away
why is this movie a classic \? the plot line was nonexistent , and the characters were completely unlikeable the implication that annie hall was a lesbian did n't make any sense ! woody allen 's character was completely freeky and there was not a single purpose for him being there come to think of it , there was no purpose for this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! so save yourself and never watch this film
over done is the best way to describe this over the top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a stolen video camera
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
believe dooby 's one \( zero \) star review not even worth a free rental not worth your precious time you have been warned
i bought this dvd based on the review of it on the dvd drive in web site either the person who reviewed it has never seen an exploitation movie before , or was not old enough to view one in the first place he made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever you would have thought it compared to the 'ilsa' movies the way this guy went on about it i'm not sure what movie he saw , but it was n't this one when the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western , you have to wonder why exactly it merited an unrated version
ernest borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie ! the actors should be embarrassed ! i could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary i ca n't believe i paid 9 99 for this dvd what a fool i was learn from my mistake
the reason the original iron chef was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting therefore , without these elements , it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program
do not confuse this with the real thing i found teh vhs of this for 1 at a store near me i was interested so i got it i watch iron chef on the food network evey night , and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it ! the one commentator is a failed comedian , and the other is a culinary half wit ! i never heard more ussless facts in a 90min span b4 in my life the chefs in the first baattle were , for lack of a better term dissrespectful , i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it during a cooking battle \? ! \? they kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs the cooks were pretty good , they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show there flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing , asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer they kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor out side of star trek or wat ever he was on the only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol all in all i give this 2 stars , and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs , not to the shows them selfs unless your a shatner fanatic , or sone won thats just kinnda like its cooking , i 'll watch it but be warned its not as good as it could be glad i only spen 1 on it bc its truely not worth more
i purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad it will run my cable modem , router , pc , and lcd monitor for 5 minutes this is more than enough time to save work and shut down equally important , i know that my electronics are receiving clean power
i ordered 3 apc back ups es 500s on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at apc i 've had them for about a month now without any problems they 've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions i 'll gladly order more if the need arises
wish the unit had a separate online offline light when power to the unit is missing , the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it is n't always easy to tell what is happening
cheaper than thick cd cases and less prone to breakage , these slim cases by memorex protect your cds most buyers will get them for use in cd or dvd burning , and these are an affordable choice from a quality company for that purpose
hi
this product was perfect it 's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd 's and dvd 's
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
i like it very much , i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
i had no problems with this card and the delivery was prompt
after going through the reviews , i bought this cf card for my canon digital rebel so far it has worked fine , though i do n't pretend to be an expert digital photographer when the card is empty , it shows 127 shots available it seems to read reasonably fast , though it takes a bit longer than i was used to with my point and shoot olympus and its smartmedia card
i am very happy with this product it folds super slim , so traveling with it is a breeze ! pretty good sound not bose quality , but for the price , very respectable ! i 've had it almost a year , and it has been along on many weekend get aways , and works great i use it alot , so it was a good purchase for me
i bought this reader because i wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures and with this reader i could leave my camera \( and its cables \) in its case and just download the picture with the memory card , i recomend this product
it 's a simple device , so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered \( they glow a bright blue \)
i was thinking about buying a 1g card , but after reading one of the reviews , i bought two 512 card , just in case that something
i have always been very pleased with the sandisk products i would highly recommend them
these earphones are great quality the sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars first , the customer support is weak there is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts , but altec lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product second , the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to \( this might be a problem for runners \)
this cf card is so fast that i can run my shutter on my camera non stop until the card is full at a frame rate of 3 5 fps no lag or slow down that is amazing it makes my camera perform better \( canon rebel xt
fast and reliable well worth the mone
perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera i used my camera with a sandisk pro duo \( the blue one \) and while most times it was fine , when i needed to take pictures in quick succession it let me down the ultra ii is noticably faster you will not regret buying this
the sandisk 512 mb secure digitial ultra ii \( sdsdh 512 901 \) sent to me was not the item i ordered i returned the item , unopened
definitely recommend this memory card , download time is great
i am happy to have several sandisk products , and all of them are excellent
the sandisk sdsdh 1024 901 is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take it is great to use with mini videos if your camera has this feature
the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive small and with a good style
it works great ! i really like it there is one small problem though the lid is really hard to take off ! i 've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little , but not much there has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on , but is n't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it i appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion
works well with or without software installed good for home use and school or traveling
this technically works well i am finding learning to use it difficult i really wish i had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one ! ! ! ! ! it is a lot smaller than i thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger
i was considering purchasing a tablet and wacom was consistantly recommended i was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because i didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line \( the intuos line \) i was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong installing a driver was a piece of cake and i began drawing away in minutes it is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs \( paintshop pro , painter , photoshop \) the mouse is pretty useless however , and i would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead \( they seem to wear out , though i do press pretty hard \) other than that , its an amazing product
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
great batteries for cameras they charge quickly , and it 's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time just in case
i bought the nulooq product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it 'd do anything for me , as i'm a keyboard junkie the product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot but what a surprise just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price the pop up menu thing is cool i do n't use it as much for putting tools , but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place i guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around , but i do n't seem to use that as much i still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around
i 've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my xp machine and am now using it with my apple mac mini works great with both windows and mac os x , with no hassles the removable stand is a nice touch , as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer highly recommended
i have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters , they are burning at 8x in my nec 2500a burner that is pretty considering that it is advertised at 4x hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years
shipping was outrageous , thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a f'n postage stamp , but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than i did for the item , could have bought it at walmart for less this way buyer beware , i got took
this is the second g15 keyboard i 've purchased , not because the first one broke , because it 's such a great keyboard now i keep one at home , and take one with me when i go lanning the only issue with the keyboard is the lcd is pretty useless is fast paced fps games , otherwise it 's good for keeping the clock up so one does n't lose track of the time
i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs , it must have a qam tuner , because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd , without paying for digital cable , almost made me weep with happiness
my new tv finally arrived and i am very pleased with it i picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews i could find online , the vast majority of which were very positive \( cnet has lots of reviews as well \) also , i have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of tvs , all day every day , and both of them bought this exact set for themselves
so , i was a little weary to buy an itrip after hearing some mixed reviews it seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs or the itrip worked perfectly knowing my luck , it would n't work for me at all i recieved my itrip and my luck started right away i tossed the itrip onto my ipod and nothing a bad omen \? well , after i exchanged my itrip for a new one i tried it out on a short drive i live in east lansing , mi and we have a very crowded fm dial i could n't find a completely blank station as recommended but it did n't matter my itrip delivered decent sound through the station as others have mentioned , charging your ipod while you use your fm transmitter will really help it 's not a night and day difference , but it 's a noticeable improvement sure , i got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal , but you know what \? through a good 40 minutes of driving , the majority of the time i had satisfactory sound this was also on the weaker signaled lx mode , not dx supposedly dx provides a better , stronger signal
i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive , put in the restore disk that you create for your system , and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use
nice sound , i will admitt for the price , i get big sound , with quality only thing is a humming , hissing sound when machine is idle ohtherwise , worth it
i , ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys , try it without an outside energy source , i just hope i , m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare , but no more pci slots , damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards , why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well , trade offs are a bi , but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
it 's a simple device , so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered \( they glow a bright blue \)
i bought this tv for college , and it fits perfectly in my dorm the picture quality is pretty decent , though compared to traditional tv , it is not as sharp
we used this charger with a dc inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a sony dsc h5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges the 2700mah battery is great
the intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad the mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks , opening programs is one of them it also has a scroll wheel on the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling i use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with the pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines it fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser the only complaint i have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them \( the lower one \) is placed in a spot where when i'm drawing my finger frequently hits it , because of this i simply had to make the button inactive over all i feel that wacom has done a very good job of developing this product i feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price i would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet , it is nice to have if you have the desk space i 've heard wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that i own one i believe it
fabulous product now i can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range happy i purchased this one very trouble free
i would n't be without this when i first bought the 20d it was my first digital slr and i spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap in the end i settled for using both and would n't have it any other way with the battery grip and hand strap in place i find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold that 's all there is to it , that 's what it does and it does it well
i have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of memorex and so far i have not had any problems they work just fine on my sony dvd burner
memorex dvd r 's are the best price keeps dropping and never have a problem
i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months , i have only had 1 burn badly have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in
this is an excellent machine i bought two of them there are a few things you need to do i have had 100 satisfaction using fujifilm dvd r up to 8x i have had success with fujifilm dvd r up to 8x i`ve also had tremendous success with tdk dvd r up to 4x and 8x some other brands may not work one thing i`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little don`t go recording 3 or 4 r or r dvds every day give it a rest between recordings one or two per day is okay definitely give it room to breathe if you stack your machines on top of each other , put something in between so they can breathe be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides you definitely need to buy a panasonic dvd player to play back your dvds other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly
i bought this for my folks for christmas it took no time at all to hook up , and making dvds was simple everything from recording off the tv , to recording movies and shows stored on the dvr , to transferring home movies from the original vhs tapes i'm sure for about 300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders , but for under 200 , you really ca n't go wrong the only flaw i could find is that the initial hookup \( according to the book \) did n't seem quite right after taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online , everything went smoothly because of that , i'm still going to give it a full 5 stars it 's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life really , if you 're new to this technology , you 're not going to have any problems believe me a
the other effusive reviews are spot on the picture is fabulous on new dvds \( lord of the rings , nemo , harry potter \) a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony kdf 42e2000 42 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly , but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and , certain dvds of old movies \( some like it hot , the king and i \) stretch the picture horizontally , making things look squat i'm sure there 's a solution , but just ca n't figure it out any tips
vhs to dvd disc is just one easy setup i set mine to record and recode just before i go to sleep when i wake up a finished disc awaits with the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct vhs that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape i have taken many vhs tapes that were never released as dvd and now have the start of a great library editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it the product works well ipod old music videos and movies for a real treat sound is perfect
i 've had this photo printer a few weeks now i do n't consider myself technically proficient i totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine you cannot go wrong the photo quality is astonishing i 've printed professional quality photos and framed them the results are fantastic for someone who is techno challenged , i had this up and running very quickly
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case buy them and conserve space there great
got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally , and they were cheaper ! !
i like keeping all my stuff in one place , but do n't like cd folders , so these slim cases are great i accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack , the case did n't break , and the cd was fine all in all , a great product
i 've used these \( and similar \) cases for years no problems , even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them
they are okay for eight or so dollars , but they do n't last very long then again , i used these for a digital camera so maybe that 's why they get drained so quickly however , for the price i still would buy them again
my daughter uses a cochlear implant that has the option of being powered by 3 aa batteries we have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest we have tried energizer , duracell , etc she needs to replace them every day and a half since the implant is a high power draining device , every extra hour counts these batteries are one of the best values out there
i have not had n e w coverage for this apple product however i had a washing machine covered by them the washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same n e w used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off throughout , n e w was great and made every effort to fix the machine when the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that i paid for it they did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that i actually had the machine
esaki si ta campion , un tremendo idea di e sistema pa por load up un potret digital ariba bo pc hopi bon y facil esaki ta pone cu bo por saca bo potret digital y pone ariba bo pc via e systema aki di chip \( tremendo
initial setup could be complex for some , but considering all it is capable of i 'd say it 's worth the time investment
i 've had it for over a month now and it works as well as i expected it to work i was expecting random quirks here and there as i continued using it , but none whatsoever
these are great earbuds i have alswys used sony dj headphones in the past , and these are the first pair of buds i have purchased i am impressed
i bought this for my kids to use with nascar racing controls are easily reprogramable nice product for the money
great product for getting all those old home videos on dv
this little unit is easy to use and ready to go ! ! ! ! not one problem with it so far , i 've been using it for over two months now
i use these batteries when i need power immediately and i do n't have a set of rechargeables ready to go i also use them as backups so i do n't get caught without power and have to pay 1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores
excellent sound system , reminds you of being in a movie theatre great , great system
i 've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality lots of hardy walkmen , useful shortwave and portable radios , stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders i still have a sony mini component stereo model fh e656 \( made in japan \) which i bought in 1992 for us 400 but rather than pay to fix its worn out cd player , i decided to purchase this new sony mhcec70 component stereo \( made in china \)
a memory stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a sony camera fantastic
this portable cd holder is perfect for me i work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym my cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd 's i like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch i would recommend it to anyone
\( note to brian the wap54g can be configured as a bridge i have two of them in just such a configuration took me about 10 minutes to set them up \)
i love the mobilemate sd i have n't had any problems yet it 's small compact and gets the job done
i like it very much , i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it does n't come with software for handhleds that person chose to buy it without and save some and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he she bought the wrong software package delorme did the right thing and offered us options i just ordered mine and i have no plans on using with a hh so i'm very happy that i did n't have to buy the hh software just do n't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it nemerous people have highly recommended this to me , although i have heard that ms mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option storing 50 , 000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome i will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route , elevation , etc too bad it is only in yellow
i got this jacket a month into having my ipod i had to buy it because i had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when i pulled the ipod out of that case it was easy to drop one time i did drop it and within a month of owning the ipod i had it in fro repairs
the product works perfectly the only problem is , the manual only includes directions for the most common setups to use one port as an uplink to a router , for example , you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled 1 and then leave port 2 open the directions do not state this , and i had to call linksys to get it to work
my setup
this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2 0 hub
i had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it it had gotten very good reviews ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some highly recommend it
i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years this is the best mouse i 've ever owned it is fast , accurate , well formed and constructed i would definitely recommend it
for those of you who bought minidisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording , this product is wonderful especially good for recording lectures , voice lessons , etc it works quite well with the built in mono mike , or you could use an external one
i got this for hubby and me over the summer we used it for our trip to rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it we have a tape deck in the car and used it w a cassette adaptor we had not problems whatsoever , in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter
works good , small , and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it , though slightly costl
i purchased this hub back in september i plugged it in and i'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment , i 've had no problems it does n't take up too much room even with 7 ports
fantastic , take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality
the product is a good value it performed well and was fairly easy to use i only wish it would allow importing play lists from itunes , all text had to be manually input overall , i'm very satisfied with the product
i previously owned the 1gb lexar 40x cf card and thought that was the fastest a cf could get i was completely wrong this card is one fast sucker , and it can hold an enormous amount of images in jpeg mode i am able to store over 1000 images in raw mode , which i'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card , i am able to hold 444 images all on my 20d ! ! ! if your thinking of buying this card , do n't hesitate it is one awsome piece of equipment , and one heck of an investment ! !
this is an excellent buy and is a quality item the service was fast and the card works as expected
a lot of space my computer is over 5yrs old so i use these cd 's as a great back up for storing all my old documents , my ebooks , and my pics
these earphones are the best i ever had i never had to try other pairs of earphone because i absolutely loved these that i keep buying it ! after 6 years i buy the same one everytime of course i never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that i brought but ca n't seem to throw them out because it costed money it seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and i can answer why thats happening it 's actually static electricity i experienced it myself a couple of times because i was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form it 's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones i suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked the bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones hey for 10 bucks or less you ca n't except sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model i abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year i think these are the best rather than buying something thats 100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost , broken or stolen
after having two sandisk card readers , and one lacie card reader die on me , i invested in this lexar card reader for the money , it has worked flawlessy with pro compact flash cards up to 4gb in size i am very impressed with the transfer speeds , and the unit is not too big for traveling the door that covers the slot , however , is very flimsy and easily deattaches \( but fortunately easily reattaches too \? \) i use mac os x 10 4 8 and it works just fine i also used it with windows xp without any installation or transfer issues
a simple , cheap investment this cf reader actually does what it should , i e transfer info from compact flash to the computer previous kodak 1 0 multi card reader had issues after a few weeks , and stopped working after 2 months this one is much faster and is still working ahhhhh
just some specs missing from amazon 's description
i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag unfotunately , it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies when worn as a waist bag , it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag there are two water pouches on the slinger bag \( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona \)
this was the least expensive 1 gb memory card i have ever seen and it works as well as it should
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , and accessories it works great , you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used \( put frequently used items in easier to access places \)
great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo
the memorex dvd r 16x discs are great i have a lacie external 16x burner that i use with my mac and i have not yet burned a bad disc i would reccommend this product to anyone looking for lots of media for a good price
manufactured of a soft gray felt like material , a tough leather bottom , and draw string closure at the top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements i store my lenses in a camera bag , and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space
this cf card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity \( e g for hi res pics \) but does n't care about the transfer speed it may be a bit annoying though especially if you try to download all the 2gbs from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time i do still consider it a real good purchase
this memory card handles the job really well unless maybe you 're a professional sports photographer , it 's plenty fast enough no problems using it with my canon rebel xt it holds about 550 pictures \( jpegs \) at the highest resolution \( 8 2 mp \)
i have only had this monitor for a couple of day 's
i had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up but after a little tweaking , it works beautifully previously owned regular crt what an improvement ! superb clarity and brightness for the money you just ca n't go wrong with this one
i use the pink circles to buff the cd dvd , and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd , as i thought it would well , i thought that those marks would disappear after i used the repair paste with the yellow circles , but they 're still there is it supposed to be like this \? the reason i bought the thing was to make the cds look like new , but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over
with boys aged 2 3 , and some poor disc storage procedures when i'm driving , it appeared i was in need of one of these units generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs , but it occassionally happens , and does n't take long for scratches , damage and finger prints to hinder performance , and when changing children 's cds in the car i do n't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also i read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products , and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a c power , is fully contained and automatic , and was about 10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit both items had mixed reviews mostly positive , but i found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products i'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all , and one that skipped
so far i havent filled up my disc yet using it the
i 've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed this is not true if you 're carefull first of all , my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned off when you change the batteries pretty simple , huh \? also , do n't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it the main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner , and i just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10 i primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and i love it
i 've been using these memorex cd rs for years and have no problems with their reliability have used them with multiple cd and dvd burners without compatibility issues this was another re order and i continue to be happy with this product
the product arrive to me in very good condition , will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd
for the most part i just want to keep it short i usually always by energizer cause they 're reasonably priced and seem to last much much longer then most other battery products that i have used in the past
these batteries are great , and seem to fit my rio 500 better than some discount batteries good price too
i have been using this d link hub for about six months the power light started flickering after about three months and now does n't light at all the hub works great , but i wonder how long it will last
i use my usb hub every day and it works fine with every device i plug into it
i'm very happy with this product it 's great value for the price the corded phone with answering machine means there 's always a phone that 's not dead and perfect for the home office area the cordless phone can be used to check the answering machine messages lot 's of features
the unit itself works great much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera however , the software includes a monitoring feature , which checks every second or so , to see if you 've plugged in a card i opened up windows task manager to discover that , each time it checked , it was consuming 25 of system resources \( on off each second \) no wonder my computer has been slower lately , especially if i have my image editing software open \( duh \)
great quality , excellent construction and strong rj45 plugs i have worked with a decent share of cat5 and i have never had to cut and terminate a belkin cable due to regular wear and tear
my husband i searched searched for dvd's that were compatable to our dvd recorded no one could help then i thought , i'll just check on amazon , and sure enough there they were ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! what a relief ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i would hate to own a dvd recorder not be able to record anything ! ! ! ! !
this unit is a good buy it is priced low , but functions like you paid a higher price the negatives are that it is n't compatible with itunes , and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed overall , it is a good product
i 'll try to keep this short and sweet if you have been frustrated trying to get am reception on the go , then you 've found the right radio for you i ca n't tell you how many pieces of junk i 've bought that barely pulled in even relatively close am stations unless i constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception luckily \( \? \) those other radios also died pretty quickly this sangean product solves the am reception problem and seems very durable i also own their ccradio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation i love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built in speaker , just like transistor radios of the 50 's and 60 's a seemingly forgotten feature as for listening through the supplied earphones , forget it sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied never have i heard tinnier sound , even for am listening not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short i immediatey invested another 35 in decent pair of koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin now i happily and easily listen to am and fm stations even over the roar of the lawnmower there might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to fm exclusivey , but if you spend even a little time on the am dial , i really do n't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio
sound great nice bank for the buck
this was my second dlo transpod i had an older white one that i bought used i figured i would upgrade to this one since my ipod and my car 's interior are black overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one , but with a few little changes
you must have received ca 709 \( without the cassette component \) by mistake ca 706 is prepackaged with the cassette component
worked perfectly
i use this keyboard at work and as i am a medical transcriptionist , it is all i use all day l o n g i really like it and i'm going to buy one for my home as well it is very easy to type on and i like the wrist support
this receiver is a replacement for an older , more expensive , defective sony that i had it was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units i am satisfied with the product
the reviews sounded too good to be true the reviews are right on this system is perfect for home theater i have the latest panasonic plasma this receiver is the perfect compliment here is why
this item does exactly what it 's suppose to do it also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception worth the money only drawback would be , there is a lot of cord hanging around
the sony ss mf650h are a low cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room
i listen to a wide range of music , from hard rock , techno electronic , to classical , and i 've found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this at least until i ordered this set i was apprehensive about buying online \( and also about the sony brand for speakers \) , but i'm very happy with this purchase i 've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends the highs are crisp and the bass is tight , not boomy the soundstage is expansive \( of course , this depends a lot on your receiver as well \) and imaging good i 'd definitely recommend this speaker set
this first time i use the hd product in my home video system and have the expected results after i installed it and it immediately scan all the signal channels in my local area and have good quality so far i place the antenna in door just in the first floor i do n't have too many channels in my living area in oh
i bought my player sep 2006 and the other region free code did not work it is actually a dvd 224m \( see manual \) though it says dvd 224 on the player here is how to do it
worked very well as planed
i would have given it a five star but sense it 's the only one i have ever used i had nothing to compare with i have used it nine tines and it worked perfect every time sturdily made
the idea is excellent , the execution is flawed what is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home the adapter should be built into the box
one of the best gadget products i 've ever bought the installation and connection was completely flawless it worked the first time and has been working since \( and i even used the powerline ethernet adapter to connect back to my router \) i have my cable tv on one input and my security system on the secondary input using my cellular data connection on my laptop , i can watch tv or look at my security system from anywhere in the country
box worked perfectly as expected however , it would be nice to be able to upgrade firmware to the new hd like performance or via a trade in program to allow old customers to upgrade to the new sling boxes
this box is perfect to have all the basic ipod accesories at once i have the 60 mb video ipod and all the accesories works perfect
\( despite some of the negative reviews of this item , it continues to perform well with my regular sized ipod in fact , it has more volume , depth , and presence than three other portable speakers each costing 50 to 75 more to which i 've compared it the only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage free from amazon , diminishing its bargain appeal somewhat \)
i liked these speakers they are small compact they work great with my mp3 player and you ca n't really beat the price my only complaint is that they do n't come with an adapter but i just bought rechargeable batteries and the system work great i use them everyda
these headphones are lightweight , fairly comfortable , and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of 20 headphones i 've ever heard here are the aspects people always want to know about
i was wondering if anyone knew if this hub would work for linking xbox 's together so you can have more than 4 people play at once i know that i could link 2 with a crossover cable but i want to link 4 together so that i can have a gigantic 16 player halo match \( it 's a very popular xbox game for those who do n't know
nothing much to say about them they 're high quality high speed rewritable discs that do what they are supposed to do i 've been using these kind of rewritable discs for a while now and i have n't had any problems with them what so ever even when i burn at higher than 10x they come with cases too so you wo n't have to worry about scratching the cds
i matched this model number up with the phone i have , and it is a perfect fit for the phone and for me i stay on the telephone for lengthy conference calls most of my workday , and the headset types that go in the ear ended up causing soreness this headset sits gently over my head with the earpiece lying on my ear i'm told i can be heard very clearly without echo or fadeout i would highly recommend this headset
i bought this because my windshield suction mount could not be trusted i 've had it fall off more than once then you drive around wondering if your 700 nuvi is going to fall and break not fun ! the friction mount works for me for everyday driving , even aggresive driving , it stays put someone on this site left feedback about using it with their nuvi 360 and i used their review to make the purchase i'm glad i did
i think this is as good as the expensive over 60 hdmi cables i would n't spend money on the expensive ones first of all , i'm not a cable junkie nor an expert however , according to my research , there 's no difference in performance b w the expensive version nor the 12 , 15 , 20 version when it comes to hdmi since it 's all digital hole buch of zeros and ones the durability of the cables i do n't know but unless you 're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason , it would n't matter normally , you 'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time , so the durability is not really relevant bottomline this is as good as the expensive ones i first tried out the expensive monster brand which was 85 then i returned it after purchasing this , for the quality was the same do n't buy the expensive ones
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well
this product is a nice headset that did fit nicely on my ear \( lucky fit i guess \) and was easy to work with it is compact and feels quite natural for me not to mention it is designed to work on either ear so in the middle of a conversation you can just change ears
i am pleased with this printer considering the price , it is a good value the cartridges are kind of expensive , but i guess most cartridges are these days
pros
this is truly a no brainer , excellent headphones at a great price , wonderful all around phones , would make a great gift also
i have been using these for a while now and they seem pretty good to me \( disclaimer i am not an audio professional , nor do i have any expensive headphones to compare with \)
not an audiophile , but someone looking to spend a decent amount of money on a quality set of headphones this product nails all the requirements great sound , great comfort , well built i 'll be buying more of these guys for friends and family
do n't let the reviews fool you at this price , it 's worth a little research apparently u3 is annoying a lot of people and the people at u3 have created an uninstall download for you to get so google it , download it , and buy the usb drive the size of this usb drive and the fact that you 'll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying after you uninstall the u3 software , it works like any other drive it works great , it just takes you ten minutes of a little extra work
i bought these headphones a week ago and i am very pleased with them at the electronic store , i listen to 3 pairs of sennheiser \( hd 433 hd 437 and hd 457 \) i hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 \( 10 more buck \) at the store the sound was ok as they were playing from the sennheiser display rack when i got home , i plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better i am very impressed of the volume and sound quality i can get from them on my computer my soundcard is an onboard soundmax ac97 on an asus k8v x motherboard i set the sound option in windows xp on headphones and played metallica nothing else matters with winamp wow ! ! ! i was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general i only use half of the volume available in windows xp and it`s more than enough for me
this is one of the best wireless phones i 've had good call quality , good speakerphone quality and good range
panasonic makes good quality products and this is no exception easy to use , very compact , no interference with cordless usage
i bought this phone to replace my older panasonic because i needed a new answering machine i love that i can retrieve messages from the handset the handset is a bit smaller than earlier models , but just took some getting used to would definitely recommend
i picked this up for 50 dollars to replace a 75 dollar uniden that had a sticky talk button and muffled sound qaulity the panasonic blows the uniden away the sound is clear , crisp , and intimate , the ring selection is varied \( i prefer the nonobtrusive default setting \) the controls are easy to use the quality and finish of the materials is high i am now a loyal panasonic phone buyer
it 's hard to believe the quality of the sound from this very small device mp3 's sound great as do the voice recordings with 1 gig of space you can record an entire day of seminar speakers and still have space left the built in stereo or mono mics are great plus , you can use it to carry files to and from work
i am a success coach and i record all my coaching calls as a standard practice this recorder has performed fantastically in all situations i get about 9 12 continuous hours of battery operation \( depending on battery quality \) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls \( i have an adapter for the phone \) i have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results i highly recommend using rechargeable batteries \( always have one extra on hand \) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time recharge before your event each day and you wo n't miss a thing the unit only uses one battery and it 's always a great idea to have a spare the unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire , so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings each stop and restart begins a new file for me that works great ! if you are looking for one continuous file , do not shut it off you can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use you would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money
a good stuff at great price and as usual amazon was fast to send the item
i decided to replace my iriver 190t after a 3rd party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the usb cable together i wanted usb 2 0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity , but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so i picked this up on sale
when i bought my intel imac w 20 lcd suddenly everything else looked dull in comparison this apple 20 is very close in spec to my imac 20 screen stores like best buy do not have good quality 20 lcds in yet you want the 16x9 profile also , the regular square lcds look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios the newer stuff is very bright and clear it is obvious when you go to a store and look at the lcd screens the cheap 200 lcds just do n't look good in comparison to the new stuff
i 've been slowly making my way to the mac side after nearly 15 years of unadulterated windows dos use the process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of apple products high and scarce
i was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great it has good reception and i like the size of it this phone is just what i was looking for
these are the best portable headphones in this price range good bass and smooth , natural sound in fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price if you can afford more , consider the sennheiser px100 for about 40 50 dollars but if you 're on a budget or do n't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones , these are definitely the ones to get
excellent mount for the 2 tv 's i 've purchased was suprised to buy one about a month ago from amazon com for 149 95 then was able to buy this one for 124 95 did i pay too much for the first mount \? ollie
this was needed for my panasonic dvd recorder works well hope it holds up as advertised looks like high quality and works well so far everything is as expected and that is good
it 's not listed in the product description but the pico works with the ipod mini too like the other reviewers , i found it easy to setup tune the radio , turn on ipod , connect the pico , tune the pico , done \) in my car , the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio i noticed this as well with my home stereo maybe the next generation pico needs a larger antennae , or my ipod needed charging regarding sound quality , my other car has a built in ipod connector the pico sound quality is comparable , somewhat muted , but enjoyable the pico does offer the advantage of displaying the ipod menu to select tunes i 've read mixed reviews on other fm transmitters , but i am pleased with the pico
i ordered this device to sit on a player piano , which can play ipod encoded mp3 files , once they are transferred from the special cds that are designed for the piano the remote is limited , as are all remotes for ipods , but for the special use i have , this is a great product it allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music
i was looking for an inexpensive , yet high quality , long lasting , and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane a fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace the brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly offering two lines of crisp , highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs my experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape in fact , i found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet since i purchased the 1750 , i have found many uses for it around the home office and i wonder how i got by without one in the past ! my only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters , it does not offer a dash or hyphen , so when one is required , i find myself using a star instead that is a minor complaint though the brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on aa battery power alone , so i have not felt the need to purchase the adapter
we recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine the cid works perfectly for both lines the interface menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but i would n't call it non intuitive
at first , i was not sure about if this windshield mounting bracket was going to stay in place while i drive trough the streets however , i was very surprised when i found out that the bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another , even under some vibration the suction rubber system is quite strong it has 2 angles for adjustment , and you can rotate the gps clockwise counterclockwise
very strong suction cup provides secure mounting quick and easy clip in and release for taking the gps with you product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways otherwise , this is a well designed and quality product
the forums speak highly of these units xr70 , and i was going to get one because of the small form factor amazon 's description for the height at 2 5 is incorrect , according to panasonic 's website should be listed as 3 9 32 h makes a difference if you 're short on space
i was paranoid about having buyer 's remorse from this unit for such a cheap price i was sure i would end up regretting the purchase what is the tradeoff \? shoot if know , but i have n't regretted buying it one bit the receiver is perfect for home theater , particularly dd 5 1 shows there is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content , which is important for tv watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments
i purchased this receiver from fry 's electronics in san diego , ca for 199 99 at first , i was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver when i got it home , and connected it , i was amazed this receiver will blow you away with the precision of it 's home theater capabilities i am using four polk r30 's as my fronts , and rear surround , and two sony center channels for my front center , and rear center channels i also have a klh 10inch tremor series powered subwoofer i estimate the entire system to cost about 650 00 total i have colleague that has a bose home theater system , and my little system blows his out of the water , and he paid much more for the bose if you want a great receiver a minimal price , this is the way to go by the way , did i mention that it has four digital inputs , an optical output , and hdmi in and out connections buy it ! ! !
the logitech stereo usb noice cancelling headset is awesome i never recieved the one i ordered from ant online , but the one i bought later at walmart owns me
i did a lot of research and finally ended up with this product
i 've had 2 other fm transmitters \( a belkin and a griffin itrip \) neither came close to the quality of this transmitter neither charged the ipod \( the belkin required batteries , which only lasted about 15 hours of use \) , while the itrip worked ok at first , but then started getting static no matter what station i used in fact , i had to have the ipod in hand for the static to go away \( and then , it was still not clear \) the sound is n't as loud as some \( it takes over the volume control , so you cant use the volume on the ipod \) still , it 's not nearly as soft as some i 've seen i found most music came through at a good volume \( i did adjust a few songs in itunes to pump them up \) this unit , although it seems cheap and flimsy at first , is able to get a consistant , strong signal , even on stations which usually come in clearly it powers through them , and the result is a very clean sound it is a little hard to read at the regular angle , but once you set the 3 presets , you do n't need to see the screen just set your radio to the same 1 2 3 configuration also , turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer in all , i could n't be happier
at such low price , this player is really pretty good
quite acceptable in line with prior purchases at outlet where pixma was sol
i 've had these headphones for just over two years , and i'm happy to see that they 're one of the few pairs marketed as surround sound that have done quite well the reason behind that is because they 're truly excellent headphones the range is spectacular and the inputs even more so you 're given the option of rca and toslink \( optical \) , which is all you really need
i just recently purchased the quickcam stx for my sister who lives overseas in greece it 's a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis surprisingly , the video and audio is quite good i do have a mac and she does n't have any issue calling me from her pc we use aol instant messenger \( video and audio \) or yahoo messenger \( video \) to connect i still prefer the isight for macs unfortunately , you ca n't use an isight on a pc wish apple could make the isight compatible with pc 's anyhow the stx is a great cam for what it 's worth
this samll web cam is doing a great job connecting my families overseas the flexible shoe is really handy and the image and voice quality is beyond my expectation
have had no problems with this item , and it 's a good price for the powered kind of usb hubs , which i have found are pretty necessary for most usb items
i found the sound fantastic just got these after usinf shure e3s for about a year i liked those but find these even better when i first tried them i found the base so much stronger than the e3s as many have alluded to now i run my ipod at normal equalizer settings i find the balance of the set dead on the fit is great , of course your milage may vary in fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable this means when i walk with them i can hear my footsteps this would be a real problem if i jogged \( low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected \)
this is my second fm transmitter and works much better than the belkin that i ended up returning because it simply was n't working
i have had my axim x51v for about three months i purchased it from dell for 480 with aluminum hardcase , extra 1100mah battery , and auto power cord
this phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones the message center works well , and the intercom feature is useful the phone is a little small , and similar to cell phones rather than a house wireless phone
this phone is small , great battery life , awesome range , and no interference the features are subtstanial and the quality is amazing from one that has always had uniden cordless phones this is a substantial upgrade
i bought one version from best buy , then i bought another with different buttons , then i bought this platinum one because its so cool looking , just make sure you save the code
sent check for full price fairly promptly , but not including tax , which ads say they will d
best earphones i ever had better then sony mdr ex51lp fontopia headphones 2 years warranty
earbud fit system is comfortable , seals out noise , for many ear canal sizes sound is great
i'm very pleased with this camera i updated it with the new drivers and software on the creative site \( from january 2006 \) immediately and i have not had any of the problems others mention the image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true usb 2 0 camera it will work with usb 1 , but be sure you use usb 2 0 for better quality
i wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days
why settle for less , when you can get a brand new original panasonic or samsung 42 inch plasma tv for free ! i got mine from this web site awesomestufffree com plasma t
like most people here , i found the bose triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups what i found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic in fact , the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended
i recently received the zen microphoto as a gift since i travel fairly often , i decided to purchase the traveldock after reading the reviews it 's great the microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply the sound is rich , loud enough , and better than any other travel speakers that i own many people comment on the bass issue for travel speakers , the traveldock has the best bass to date , in my opinion true bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer \( for an additional 60 from creative 's website \) i'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience the jacks are easy to reach and use , which are on the back of the unit also , the microphoto charges while docked , whether it 's playing or not there 's even an attachable fm antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked \( since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also \) by the way , it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between fm and mp3 's , adjust volume , and play pause ff rew overall , this is a very nice addition to the zen microphoto
again , creative labs has combined all you need into one package line in jack , usb port , fm antenna , and even a jack for a sub woofer ! for a small portable speaker , this system gets pretty loud and clear the stereo effect button works great , the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch now for the cons like most reviewers , i too , have to say the bass is lacking a bit , and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily , but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price , this speaker system is very good
i bought these speakers based on price because i just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater it turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price
nice little system but only 4 ohms so doesnt handle a lot of power good sound for an apartment
for the cost , you ca n't go wrong with these speakers from jensen we love them , and in shopping around found them to be one of the best home theater values the sound is great , and the speakers are perfect for just about any home theater need
purchased this iterm for my hp8450 printer pictures are outstanding and the cartridge does the job only problem is the cartridge gets eaten up in no time at all cost per print no bargain problem is n't with the catridge , but with the printer and print process now we know why hp has printers at such reasonable price they eat you up and spit you out via the price of cartidges that 's where the real profit lies amazon is tops in price and service delivery
about 2 1 2 years ago i finally got into the digital age i began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there \( kodak , hp , store brands , etc etc \) by far , the most superior paper is canon they make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints great photos
echoing most other reviews here , this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money but buying them is a risk ! if you do n't wear these earphones correctly , they sound terrible , easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones those unsatisfied with the sound quality \( especially those complaining of lack of bass \) either have n't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears
this was the largest set that would fit into my space i also looked at the westinghouse 37 inch hd moniter at best buy the first time , i looked at the westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy then i read the review on cnet which said the westinghouse picture was actually better than the sharp i went back to best buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the westinghouse could be improved he said it was as it good as it could be he than said the sharp was twice the price of the westinghouse , so i should expect a better picture on the sharp in any event , i purchased the sharp on amazon during the recent electronic express sale on hd , the picture is amazing it 's also quite good on regular tv
we bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels it 's not a ton , but one monitor has three that are red in the center of the screen , and other has a few that are bright green in the corner not a huge deal , but there are some in all 3
this is my second purchase of these speakers they provide great sound especially for the price my kids use them with their computers and ipods i recommend them to everyone
really do n't think you can get better sound for your dollar not only look cool , but sound great have only had for two months , but no issues
before i bought this product , i was contemplating which brand name hard drive i should go with i was told seagate was top of the line it truly is no problems at all , easy to setup and use , and a fair price i highly recommend seagate over any other brand name \( i 've heard problems with other brands \)
this is a great little piece of hardware
this drive is whisper quiet , easy to install and use , and in my experience , plenty fast i recently encoded my cd collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files i also used foobar2000 lame to convert the flac files to mp3 , all on this drive during the process of converting the files , which is pretty io intensive , i found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate
i purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter i chose boston acoustics over tivoli because you ca n't preset the stations in the tivoli and i like to flip through commercials other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering i listen to rock music and do not notice the bass my complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly it does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house also if you are listening to the radio you ca n't see the time display
excellent accessory , portable and you do not have to apply anything permanent to your vehicle highly recommended
wow ! now i can transfer all i have in my pc to my cellphone it 's awesome i need no cable to transfer stuff from my pc to my cellphone and from my cellphne to my pc you can get this item in a very special price get it ! !
i own a set of older martin logan speakers their quality is legendary with a price to match so i was interested in maximizing performance when i called their office for advice , one of the tech guys \( excellent service , by the way \) told me the monster banana plugs were great , not the best or most expensive available , but a good value that was enough for me my speakers are bi wired so i purchased two sets of four plugs installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful add to that the free shipping , no tax and a total price saving of 12 00 and you ca n't do better than amazon !
this ai n't cheap , but it 's worth it i 've learned my lesson buying cheaper toner cartridges , but they do n't even come close to the quality and longevity of the brother brand you get what you pay for
no problems with these , and great price at amazon
this is an awesome little mp3 player i enjoy both the mp3 player and the fm radio it is very easy to use and syncs well with windows media player it is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small it came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches my only problem with the player is that i ca n't fit more than 66 69 songs although it says there is about 70mb of space left on the player
i 've been using this router for a few days i just had to set it up i have n't had any cause to touch it since , it 's very reliable highly recommended
unit works about as expected , with possible exception of a few areas of the screen that are not too sensitive to the touches from the stylus so far i am working around that this is my 3rd deluxe and the 1st one to give any operational problem of any sort generally a good product
yeah , so apparently this was a really good pda to buy i bought this three years ago and it still works ! ive been searching for a new pda since i thought this one was so out of date , and when reading all the reviews i came across many new state of the art pdas that broke after only a few months this baby has been great to me for three long years , so if you are looking for a reliable buy , go for this definately not flashy , very basic all i use it for is appointments , dates , and to dos great for students who want to use a pda as an agenda !
i am working with my new pda the live drive and is great to have akk ny videos , music and to write my notes and documents before my shift or meeting , and also the wireless connection is so great i like the option that you can use it as an external drive
i am extremely happy with this purchase and will most likely purchase another one of these , soon
netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their rangemax adapter work well with the microsoft xp operating system if you 're not a techie , i 'd stay away until microsoft has certified the wpn311 here 's what i experienced
i lost my previous radioshack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the queens power failure and wanted something dependable the price is great for its rating and all the stuff included , and it is kind of cool looking too ! recommend without reservation
i'm using the monster cable mp home theater powercenter hts800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high end tube pre amp the line noise is removed beautifully however , the powercenter itself creates a high pitched tone the tone comes out of the powercenter device directly if you are planning to use this product on a high end sound system , i recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated
for the background , i 've owned used various iem \( in ear monitor \) headphones over the years ety er4p , altec lansing im716 , shure e2c , sony ex71 , koss ksc75 here 's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week
all in ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something sound travels along wires it 's physics , there 's nothing you can do about that now , these earphones are incredibly light weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires
this is the 4th spindle i 've ordered and i have n't had a problem with any of my dvds
this little charger works great it is the second one of it 's kind that i have purchased the last one took a lot of abuse and therefore i needed to replace it would buy it again charges quickly and is quite handy
the fang is amazing ! ! ! ! ! i just got it , theres nothing like it the keyz are in the perfect spot to kill all your fellow gamers all you need is the fang and a mouse and your good to go you have to get this if you want to stand a chance in fps games
i love the new nanos i do n't think i have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio it is small and very thin you barely feel it in your pocket , which might annoy some people but not me i 'd rather get this than any zen products or sandisk sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner the screen is really bright with the full color display the new earbuds are a lot more comfortable than the old ones the new ones are n't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out i do n't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me ! the new color coating is scratch resistant , but not the click wheel and the apple symbol but you do n't notice the scratches on the white parts the longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano , 24 hours ! the new 4 gb color nanos are the same price as the 2 gb of the 2nd gen nanos i'm so happy i waited after the 1st gen nanos came out i would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily , have a dark screen , and have a short battery life the new nanos are great deals and great gifts i recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good , reliable , scratch resistant , cool looking music player ! 5 5 star
i am satisfied works great with my phone nokia e6
i have to say , when i first purchased this little goodie , i just assumed i was buying more memory for my motorola q i had no idea just how useful and reliable this would be it has proven to be not only invaluable , but a very good investment , based on price and usage buy one , no two these things are great
i'm a big fan of trackballs and this one is my favorite on the market right now just love it
i thought i 'd weigh in , as the reviews suggesting noncompliance with apple products seemed ominous i bought a passport , and the usb outlet on my macbook powers it perfectly well i do n't need an external power supply
these verbatim discs have the datalife plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100 years i'm a professional photographer and it 's crucial to store my client 's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come i 've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data \( read errors \) many times but so far with the hundreds of verbatim discs i 've burned so far , i have n't had a problem yet the kodak brand discs were also excellent , but kodak discontinued making them sony also makes a good disc these discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the epson r200 r300 r320 , and the surface area is printable right up to the hub ! i have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as verbatim continues to make a great disc
these verbatims are terrific as you may know , working with dvd r media is almost a gamble cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players sticking to name brands helps , but even then , some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot batch may be good , the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else usually , you 're safe with media made in japan these verbatim 's are made in taiwan but , they are great i 've bought one every couple months and i'm on my 3rd spindle now
notebooks pro is the highest rated webcam \( for notebooks \) on the market and for good reason audio and video quality is excellent you can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem the echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams , especially with the use of video on the negative side the usb cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop also , i have the quickcam fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall logitech ships that product with quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to quickcam 9 the notebook pro uses unfortunately , logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues b
i had the previous version also it is so far the best webcam i ever owned do n't even bother to compare it with cheap creative ones the frame rate and picture quality is awesome works in very low light conditions and has great software which can even make gieco or alien out of you
i got this mouse because i have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity i'm happy to say it is nearly gone \( the pain \) i ordered one for my office and will now get one for home it does take a bit of getting used to \( after years of movable mouse action \) but it can be done
unlike many other cables that splice a v output , this cable does so while retaining the details of that output i e , both left and right channels are extracted and outputted , not simply the left channel with audio mixed down to mono also , it works on some computers , too !
i am running the radioshark on a g4 powerbook w mac os x 10 4 i am very happy with the programmed recording saves to a variety of formats , etc very handy ! the unit did all that it promised , but it could have had much better software a dashboard widget is also included that controls basic operation , but not recording or eq
this is a total bargain not only was the price right , it works perfectly in the car , at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my ipod nano when they 're put together it looks like one unit and if , by chance , you use a motorola rzr phone the charger works with he itrip and recharges the nano , eliminating the need for any other charger devices
the over the air picture is crisp , colors are bright and the size is just right pretty good viewing angle as well
i totally recommend this mouse i purchased the 1st mouse a few months about and just now bought another one for my other laptop i like it that you have an assortment of colors you can chose from also the battery life is pretty good also
i use this with an imac it does not come with drivers for mac os x , nor does d link offer any help they refuse to admit it will work with macs i was pointed toward a driver made available at i remember having trouble getting it to work , but once it was working it has worked well and consistently the imac connects to an aebs a couple rooms away through the d link
i have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new ipod all i wanted was decent sound for a decent price , but after trying various models of ear buds and standard phones and returning them all i figured i was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all but , then i decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be the only choice for headphones koss of course ! and man they still have it these are n't the greatest phones i 've ever heard , but for 20 \( and it seems you can now get them for half that ! \) they easily compare to some well known sets costing 3 times as much or more finally , no awful hi mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer cough cough sony cough they are fairly comfortable i think i would rather have the traditional over the head band but you get used to these pretty quick these sound nice , full the bass does n't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it 's smooth and most important , you can listen for hours without ear fatigue without a doubt , these are the best budget phones i 've ever owned ! my bottom line anyone who does n't grab these for 10 bucks a pop is insane period g
i 've tried several different brands of headsets and this one wins it reduces noise , has excellent sound and is comfortable for hours at a time my office is between the shop , where we make rocket engines , and the flight line on the airport , where airplanes are tested sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run ups , or idle the apu for hours this headset reduces the white noise while still allowing me to hear the phone ring even when a local f 4 phantom ii tests the afterburner
good price good company i use this on my kodak cx7300 and it 's fine good product to buy
works as advertised , have not had a single problem with it since installing it in my tungsten t
bought this a few months ago for my 3yr old son he loves it we have used it in the car as well as when he goes to meetings with me never had a single problem with it
we bought this product for a long car trip and the kids loved it i 've also used it and thought the sound and picture were wonderful it was exactly what we were looking for and for a fantastic price ! we are very happy
i 've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase i 've used them for hooking up my gaming systems , tv , cable box , and receiver dvd player \( note i had to buy a small 3 in 1 fiber optic switch box to handle all these cables my receiver and tv only had one digital audio connection each \)
i have had this phone now about 3 months and i am very happy with it it has all the things and want and many more , the hand sets are very clear and i love the fact i can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it i do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail the range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this so far i love everything with this phone , it is much better than either of the last two phone i have had i have walked over a 1 2 block from the house and it still works clearly , i have never had a phone that worked so far away from home
i purchased the notebook cooler approximately one month ago , after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating thankfully , the same time i read that , circuit city was having a sale on this item for only 15 , after mail in rebate fast forward one month and my opinion of the cooler so far not bad
the logitech mx 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy it is very reliable , accurate , scrolls smooth , and is precise and responsive on every surface i have used it on it is also light weight and comfortable , making it the purfect mouse for the price
i bought two pairs of these when i saw them in a store on sale for under 15 each they 've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years the cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that i suppose imitates leather in looks and feel this outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs , which makes it look raggedy , but the comfort and sound quality is n't affected by it so i do n't consider it a big deal the headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it should , but likewise , it 's something to be expected with this much use and has n't affected comfort
i recently bought these speakers because i wanted to play my ipod in the office the sound is better then expected while i would get a better speaker system for my home , for the office or on the go , these will do very nicely
myself and my grandchildren love to hold these adorable pets , their fun lifelike and surprisingly sturdy get one !
what a relief to find this mouse after having bought a microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad i had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another microsoft ergonomic mouse a year ago , which became chronic , but barely noticeable until i tried the 6000
this laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the logitech v200 i have
jbl speaker system for ipod is an outstanding product , i would highly recommend it
this is a product too unique for me not too try i 've struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes there 's just no other easy way i 've found to keep track of all my receipts
i have used this and the optical cable for 20 less , it sounds just as good monster cable is a great price point investment for anyone who wants to get the most out of their home theater system
excellent antenna why pay so much more for other indoor antennas such as terk or samsung i tried both of those but ended up with the zenith at a fraction of the price and with much better reception
i live in manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception i use it hooked up to an hp 3200 lcd tv with built in tuner it took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception the cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light i have it resting atop my center channel speaker 20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide especially for football
this is very comfortable and works very well it 's heavy enough that it does n't move around or push the keyboard , as some of the other types of wrist rests that i 've used have done yet it 's cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support
i type medical reports for a living , up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week without the wrist rest , my wrists would not be able to hold up the wrist rest is the perfect size it stays in place on the desk the gel continues to be supportive , even after a year of working on it the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell i ca n't smell it while typing , only when i pick it up for cleaning i wish there was the option for half stars i 'd give this 4 1 2 stars
works well customer support from garmin more than excellent one complaint very short battery life requires a 12 volt charging adapter windshield suction cup charge adapter is a must to use as a g p s also get a minimum 512 mb sd card for combo marine and street navigation one plus is the brightness , unit size , and screen size do not keep it in your breast pocket while on the boat dont float not waterproof nuff said
this product took less than 5 minutes to unbox , install , and work properly well built , and functions exactly as i would have hoped i am impressed with the ability of the suction cup to stay attached , even in the summer heat of las vegas
this is a very simple product that works as advertised easy to set up within macos x i use the airtunes functionality which is very cool i do n't use the usb printing while more expensive than other 802 11g routers access points , the simplicity airtunes functionality make it worth the extra money
this uniden phone answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago here 's a list of the other things about this phone that i like most
very effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone i have sound is ok for what it does however , in a moving vehicle , it actually distorts the music which is a surprise my other noise cancelling headphone does not do that it appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise cancelling wave by the time the opposite wave applies to the music , the intruding noise is over otherwise , no complains
i was debating over the picturemate , kodak printer dock 3 , sony ddp fp50 , and the hp photosmart 475 i made the choice of the hp and i love it ! the prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints i use the hp 4x6 boarderless premium plus photo paper with the hp ink and the prints are just wonderful forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all \( \) the hp produces bright , vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime the picturemate is also alot larger than the hp 475 the 1 5gb hard drive is a plus as well hp said that the remote is not included but they lied , they come with the remote and battery overall , this printer is the best i have own
these dvds are absolutely top quality , and you really need to use bad dvds to know how bad they can get i ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far not a single coaster , and nero data verification \( i always do that for dvds \) has not brought up any errors ever btw , the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files the burner is the dvd multi drive on my dell inspiron laptop \( 1505 \)
i burn a ton of dvds and have used almost every brand out there many have errors , even the top brand names like memorex etc
first off , these puppies sound good ! however , there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know
i purchase two of these phones to add to our base unit very easy set up quality product
i had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 mb memory stick , which is nearly the same price or this one , which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one i choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise j r electronics shipped it so quickly \( you guys rock ! ! ! \) this one comes par with sony memory media in every field so why choose the one with lesser memory capacity choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space
delivered on time , no problems setting it up \( just followed the instructions to format it because i did n't want the default format it comes with , which is less safe \) it 's been running fine ever since i bought it i ca n't comment on the speed of access because , since i leave it backing up over night , i do n't really care it 's all done in the morning anyway , so i do n't really need anything faster
i like this unit it is hooked up to an s video in from my digital cable box , and uses a component video out to a mitsubishi hdtv picture quality is very good i'm very used to my high quality sony dvd player dvp ns700p , but this one is very close there is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the cable box , but then i 've not compared with other units i think its more than acceptable a dvd i burned played fine on the sony but when i recorded one program , deleted it , and then recorded again , it would only play on an older sony dvd player my sony dvd player is kind of touchy , anyhow
i do n't normally write reviews on products but in this case i feel i must share the value and features of this product you ca n't go wrong in selecting this player recorder for your dvd needs the quick start guide is just that quick and well planned the people at samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best i have seen well documented with pictures \( in full color \) and just that step by step for the novice the setup diagram is excellent the features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize \( any disc \) and away you go one touch record starts immediately the quality is superb especially in high definition i could n't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last electronics trade show so i was able to get it from back east about three weeks ago finalizing discs is a snap and easy i have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the samsung is so easy the on screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers ! it will play mp3s , cds , computer made divx movies , region 1 dvds , picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly you can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer 's codes which they list in a handy guide if you are shopping for a multi recorder player search no more get this one you wo n't be disappointed
i bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk i was totally wrong ! ! ! these are great , they give the bass right where you want it sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much watch out these come on sale instores for around 8 00 sometimes that 's where i got my 1st pair
the sound range and clarity is quite good , they are comfortable my only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes , i 'd like to use it with my computer not a mp3 attached to my belt
i got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued \( which , in my opinion , was a big mistake on apple 's part \) and i absolutely love it ! mine is pink , and the color is so nice , the design sleek and seamless all around it 's smooth metal casing is really nice and different the clickwheel is smooth and i have had no problems with it
i have n't written any reviews for amazon before , but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball , i had to respond i 've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90 's when kensington first came out with the turbo mouse it was great then , and now it 's better this is as solid , smooth , and precise of an input device as you can get i do n't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk this baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down you can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand your choice the optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance the only drawback is the 100 retail price , but frankly it 's worth that it 's a no brainer at 80 which is what i paid through amazon to tiger direct if you need \( or want \) a high performance trackball that you 'll be able to use with many computers to come , get this one
these speakers are awesome for the price they charge your ipod even when the unit is off the sound quality is great for around 50 bucks i bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room they also stack so they do n't take up much counter space i ca n't say enough about the sound quality they are great
i work for a small sized consulting engineer 's firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text \( magazine articles , old projects , letters from the client , books , etc \)
the cd sound is like being at the concert hooking the radio up to a television makes the home theater experience even better the fm radio receiption is even clear great quality product worth the money
these are some great headphones with a few minor flaws
i have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set \( a midiland 5 1 system \) was thoroughly aged and falling apart i decided it was time to upgrade i wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd 's i shopped around and came to the conclusion i would aim for the form factor speakers when considering this bose system , this must be taken into account
ladies and gentlemen ,
very easy to use expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level no external power required highly recomend it
could not have been easier to install literally just put the included cd in the drive , and plug the device into your usb 2 0 port installed and self configured in minutes very small , light , no additional power cords to worry about , no additional software \( beyond the automatically installed drivers \) to install quick and easy only issue i found is that the antenna is permanent , so you could never swap for replacement better antenna like you can on some other wireless nics
this cover is very durable , however it is somewhat difficult to get the ipod into the case the case covers the entire ipod except for small vent holes so it is very water resistant , but the case covers the locking button making it harder to lock and unlock the ipod
i purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house to start , i bought only one additional phone i 'll buy the rest later so far i am very pleased the sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that i have found very useful like the talking caller id and being able to screen messages from any of the phones i also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering \( download \) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones and each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom
kingston 's 2gb data traveler usb drive is perfect to storage files i have looked for a 2 gb usb and found this one to be the cheapest based on its characteristices i think it is a bargain price
i love these speakers and the price was great
i'm very happy with the kensington sx 2000 i listen mostly to jazz and the midrange is as good as the higher end bose or apple speaker systems pumping up the volume does not distort in any way either plus , i have my speaker on a divider that equally services both ends of the open space
i love belkin and their surge protectors are top quality i specifically look for their brand and i am always very impressed this model has been especially good to me over the last 3 years and i would highly recommend it
i am a camcorder buff ever since my children were born , i have
this little device is a great invention from hp i had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with hp tech support \( india \) for 1 75 hours , i spent very little time on hold
i recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at ebay 2 pairs of jbl e20s and 1 pair e30s , an e25 center speaker and a harmon kardon avr i got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of e20s and the e30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend
i repartitioned the disk so i have a macintosh partition and a windows partition i back up both my mac and my pc to this disk it is fast and easy to use
i use the drive to back up important data i write a few gb to the drive each time i was surprise by how fast data transfered onto the hard drive through the usb2 0 interface it is quiet and i have no complain
used for backing up a huge quantity of high resolution digital images the drive is fast and quiet in it 's operation , while taking up very little space on the desktop i highly recommend this drive and this brand of drives
this equipment is simply and perfect a viable connection to the world where you are ! my work forces to me to travel to very distant sites where the communication was difficult and this creates a access point to me for connected to the world via interne
noel lee 's monster cable products inc , come up with the goods here ! a cable of stunning , high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you 'll think you 're watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television monitor , a bold claim indeed , but , quite true never the less i was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better this cable brings to the viewer all the picture , and , yes , that does mean warts and all so , be prepared to see the smallest of detail , like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work un seen who really needs hdtv when cables like monster 's mvs3 1m are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost thanks noel , well done
i stretched them till they fit comfortably on my wide head they sound great to my ear and i use them alot
i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure imo , you cannot beat the sound of a set of over the head headphones i have tried all styles earbuds , behind the neck , clips , even the ear plugs nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros \( granted , i have never tried the sportapros or portapros , but from what i have read , they are the same headphone except they are ugly ! \) the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs plus , you ca n't beat that price
this is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows usb 2 0 protocol for very fast transfer if you need to transfer data from one digital product to another , this is very handy and i think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one
i basically bought these because they were cheap cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example the ur 20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies it has excellent bass and sound isolation i am by no means an audiophile but i know good sound when i hear it and these headphones produce great sound , especially for its price
not a bad battery deal while they do n't last as long as some other batteries i 've tried , their cost per battery more than makes up for it for those that care about such things , they contain no mercury , no cadmium , and are made in china
i 've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else i have \( or had \) severe carpal tunnel syndrom this keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely i ca n't think of a downside yes , it takes a bit of getting used to and yes , the keys are a bit noisy but i have no problem with that it just reminds me i'm working
we previously had an at t cordless w answering machine \( 1 handset \) and always had trouble locating the one receiver kind of like misplacing the tv remote with 3 handsets , we are spoiled also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room with the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet , we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom \( which we can turn the ringer off \)
corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now a days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages , mobile phone down for whatever reason , etc this is one of the few corded phones with caller id and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless , etc also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house
wow , who would 've thought that you could get such amazing products , at affordable prices the staff 's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have this is one amazing phone system \( uniden tcx905 \) , i forgot that it 's a cordless
bought this for my son who is in iraq he does n't leave his tent w o it ! !
i'm going to cover compatiblity , sound , and comfort
i am overall quite pleased with these headphones the sound quality is excellent i 've not had any problems with interference , background hiss or anything of that nature
the keyboard is good quality and the best product i could find for the price i recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space the keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer so makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers
first off , let me say that this is a very impressive monitor my points of reference for that statement are my other three lcd monitors three samsung models , two of which are 913ns and the other is a 712n these two samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this viewsonic , and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this viewsonic surprisingly , i actually can see the brightness difference between the samsungs and this viewsonic , but , for my taste and needs , the samsungs are simply too bright , and i end up turning down their brightnesses anyway for high light , daytime use , i have found that i do like to have the brightness all the way up on the viewsonic , but i truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being
i'm using this ap , along with a netgear 802 11g pc card to test streaming live recorded tv to other parts of my house seems like a capable product even if i did n't use the 108mbps feature
the sound quality is pretty darn good , except that if you pace around while talking listening , there are these annoying clicking scratching sounds they are quite , and , if you stand still they go away i 've had other phones that click scratch while pacing around , and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking at least this phone does n't do that
i got this base and added 6 tcx805 handsets to it the whole setup works great i got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone that features works well , there 's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that 's trivial i will say this , you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base i just take mine off , turn on bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base
this product is great allowed me to connect a distant printer to my computer by hooking two of the extension cables together worked right away no problems
this is a great headset for my use it is very clear i use it for work , and i only make use it periodically throughout the day , making about 10 calls daily so i do n't wear it all the time
researched a lot before i bought this tv and for the money , this one was hands down the best 32 lcd also , amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues
i had a zen vision m but i returned it because i decided i did n't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and i wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player , so i decided to go with the zen v since it 's interface is almost identical to that of the zen vision m 's \( which i liked \)
i have had these speakers for over a month and i love them they sound awesome they were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described
i read the other reviews for these speakers so i had very high expectations i can only say wow ! the premium price \( compared with lesser 2 1 speaker systems \) is absolutely justified
for reference , i 've owned a set of labtec apx 6420 2 1 speakers for about 6 7 years now with the purchase of a a new computer \( mac pro cinema display \) i decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers i spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models , listening to them in stores whenever possible of the major pc speaker makers , i recall sampling altec lansing , logitech , klipsch , bose , creative , and jbl aside from listening in stores \( a poor environment \) i also took into account personal experience with the brands \( mostly the first three i listed \) in regular home situations
i 've owned these altec 's for over three years now , and i have yet to ever coming close to replacing them as a matter of fact , when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer , i went ahead and still purchased these babies !
my sound improvement was n't as dramatic as many people describe , likely because i already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers , but i did notice an improvement over the integrated system i have once i made some adjustments if you listen to rock , pop , blues or jazz , this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier it also seems to improve pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3 's , though i have to keep the volume at about 3 4 in the pandora player to prevent distortion if you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo , i'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound , but it might
i wondered what kind of mouse i would get for 60 i kept thinking , what could be so special about it well , i do n't know where to begin i like it so much , i'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work i used a microsoft explorer mouse prior and thought i 'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons i needed this mouse completely puts the explorer to shame it took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but i soon caught on i really did n't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it that 's not why i got it , although it does look pretty cool as for gaming , i really did n't notice much improvment in my skill but it really does feel better in your hand the bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier
i got the razor diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it 's performance for gaming it 's great , but i do not recommended it for everyday mousing around
i decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g i did this because the g card would randomly disconnect when the wep or wpa security was activated living in a home near about 6 other networks i really wanted the router and wireless network secured so , i purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem i can happily say it solved the random disconnect with wpa security turned on the range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid have not had a disconnect yet , over the last 5 hours
this was easy to set up and use it receives the signal from the router in all the rooms in my house
camera works great ! the first one i ordered did not function correctly but amazon promptly replaced it resolution is good and audio is a great bonus that works very well a great feature for me that i found was not available on all other devices was the ability to have video stored on a network folder additionally , there is no software required to run this
a device like this either works or it does n't this one happens to work
i had no problem with the product the directions were pretty simple
the first week i had these , the left earpiece 's plastic rails which hold the earpiece in its slot broke the parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic
i ordered these headphones from amazon based primarily on user reviews of a number of noise cancelling headphones i am quite pleased with my purchase though not stellar audiophile quality , the sound is pretty darn good , and with some minor eq it 's excellent the noise cancelling effect seems to work very well much better than i expected furthermore , the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed i highly recommend them
i recently bought a new 6 0 megapixel digital camera \( canon powershot s3 is \) which came with an extremely small and practically useless 16mb secure digital card so i bought a couple of these 1gb pny psd1grf3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than 20 apiece these sd cards are made in japan by toshiba \( they are then rebranded and sold by pny , lexar , daneelec , etc \) and i have been very pleased with them so far they work flawlessly with no write speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound , and the card reader in my hp pavilion m7480n media center pc \( running windows xp professional service pack 2 \) reads the pictures and video into my adobe photoshop elements 4 0 and premiere elements 2 0 software programs with no problems the only drawback is that the read speed on these standard sd cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster sd cards it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1gb card onto my pc but i find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem so , if a little longer read time is not a problem for you , then save yourself some money and buy this card overall , a very good standard sd card at an excellent price !
there is n't too much to write about this except is delivers as stated great product for the price
i set up a small security program with my macintosh intially i needed a pc to place the settings in the camera , however once i got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully i would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you do n't you will be getting just a black , fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security this camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming , pan , tilt etc if you need a simple camera you ca n't go wrong with the d link dcs 900 \( wireless or wired version \)
what can you say \? i placed my order with amazon com a few days later the product arrived at my door perfect
the quality of materials zipper , hard case , strap and light
i bought this package purely for the keyboard i wanted a new one with wireless technology and i was driven to bluetooth just because it is so reliable i do not use the keyboard and mouse together , however
i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup the sound quality wont blow your mind , but it does not sound bad its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price it has a switch in the back for outdoor indoor not really sure what that does very easy installation with the brackets included \( no screws provided \) overall great unit for thye pric
i agree that these cables are way too expensive ! ! however that being said , they really do perform well i have been using them for almost a year and they are just solid colors always look their best i know it was a silly purchase but my dvd 's look great
overall , a good phone low cost well built many features speaker works ok for the price features such as caller id and the speaker phone are powered by batteries as stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months , even if you do not use the battery powered speaker phone often this phone would be a great phone \( for the price \) if it did not use batteries , but was a plug in model
for a long time i was looking for a phone to use with skype for the price and convenience , actiontec internet phone wizard was the best i found and ordered it from amazon \( 42 99 with free shipping \) after receiving the modem i have been using it for almost a month now and i am extremely happy i have connected my codeless phone to it and everything seems to be working fine
this headset is everything that i hoped it would be and the seller rates 100
you can never go wrong with this paper i always buy it here , the price in stores is outrageous
my experince shows that it is always better to use paper from the same brand as your printer then the result is really outstanding print after print the paper is really top quality and regardless of your needs it will satisfy them bravo canon for this first class product
agree with the reviewer who called this a 'perfect product' it is
i purchased this to use with my newly acquired slingbox pro all i had to do was plug these into wall outlets and connect the lan wires worked like a charm could n't believe it was that easy great performance and good price from amazon
bottom line up front
this is a corded mouse fits comfortably in your hand moves smoothly across table surface works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support
it has very good definition but is slow , even in the night is not that good and is slower
while the product description states this battery is compatible with motorola t5320 , t5400 , t5420 , t5600 , t5620 , t5700 , t5720 , t5800 , and t5820 2 way radios the 53615 is compatible with many more to bad amazon could n't put this online for us
i purchased this phone system as a gift i set it up and used it extensively the handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone many different ring tones to choose from , the antenna lights up when a call comes in you can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you 'll know when they 're calling without picking up the handset
i was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when i ran across these on a website i was a little hesitant at first because i do n't think i ever spent over 40 on a pair of headphones i finally decided to invest in these because i spend most of my free time listening to music i received these the other day , and immediately plugged them into my ipod please do n't let the breaking in period discourage you ! after these become comfortable , you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time
this is the ultimate ears super fi model especially designed for bassheads , featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies i do n't think ue would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature yes , the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed , but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction
we have this for our 30gb ipod and it works fine in both our cars very handy and a must buy ! !
this is the 2nd gamepad i 've owned \( my first pc was in 1993 \) the 1st gamepad was the gravis gamepad \( 4 button d pad \) i recently upraded and there is no game midi port on the new system , plus i need more buttons for need for speed most wanted , etc
we have had this phone for almost a year and i love it we have the base station which is also an answereing machine plus we have a sattelite phone i wish we had more satelite phones i love the talking feature because i just listen and know who is calling i also love the programming feature i never have to look aup a tel number that i call regularly anymore i just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on
the system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an in home office which had a single network connection have n't measured simultaneous throughput to multiple computers yet , but from simple observation connectivity seems transparent should allow for movement to gigabit switching in the future as well
this cable is of the best quality , quick shipment and at a price that beats all the retail stores you ca n't go wrong
i did buy a set of 2 base station and extra handset its a great design , tons of features , mp3 ring ton , picture caller id , sync with your pc for phone book , answering machine , etc
i work at a home office so i am on the phone lot i always buy cordless phones i can use with a headset so i can have both arms free while i talk with a min of background noise intrusion in other words , i do n't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear and i do n't use speaker phone features let 's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that i could n't care less about
i bought this for my kids computer when i bought a new one for hubby and myself these speakers sound better then the more expensive ones i have
i wanted a top quality palm with the bells and whistles this is pretty close to it but i had a few problems with the email and web features granted i am not a techie , but connecting and checking email should be more straightforward all the other features are top notch and overall i love my palm
i purchased this item for a long trip so i could charge and or play my zen mp3 player in the car without worrying about battery life on the trip it worked great i am also planning to use it for my notebook in the car the same way because the car adapter for my notebook costs 100
i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure imo , you cannot beat the sound of a set of over the head headphones i have tried all styles earbuds , behind the neck , clips , even the ear plugs nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros \( granted , i have never tried the sportapros or portapros , but from what i have read , they are the same headphone except they are ugly ! \) the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs plus , you ca n't beat that price
for the price is is great
i thought that this flash drive was above average in performance works well between a macintosh and a pc i liked the feature missing from my last flash drive of easily emptying the drive after use without having to some fancy erasing techniques in other words , the pny worked like a real hard drive i would like the manufacuters to explain in detail how to attach the tread to the laniard it took me a while to figure it out
with so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market , it was sort of struggle to decide ultimately , i felt very comfortable going with the bose brand plus , in my opinion , this is about the sleakest and best looking unit out there \( i went with black i'm not an apple white drone \) the sound is very , very good for small to medium size spaces there are not a lot of features to the unit , which i think is a good thing it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes power cord is plenty long and i like the fact i can easily move the thing to a different room if i need music there
well , the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock its very simple just put your ipod on there and rock out to the beat the bose quality is very obvious , and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it , which brings me to my next point its too expensive my recomendation is to buy an fm transmitter and listend to your ipod on any fm raido the only disadvantage of an fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod , and its slightly easier \( but thats what ipod is all about , isnt it \? \)
i'm a jogger , and like to listen to all things considered while i run miles and miles this radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive it has a convenient lock button to prevent accidentally changing the station with a bump i previously had a similar size unit from aiwa , this sony has much much better reception
this works well , allows you to view imported photos , but it is a slow proccess best left for the hotel room just plan on taking plenty of batteries and the charger for your ipod
this card is the largest size that will allow clean video with finepix cameras from 2004 or earlier the picture to picture lag time is minimal with this card and video is excellent
i was devout in my belief that i could get similar photo output from my canon s800 with less expensive paper i bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of kodak 's photo quality glossy from costco my prints were blotchy then i got my hands on some of canon 's photo paper pro , and my pictures were magically crystal clear the difference is amazing i never would 've thought paper would make this much difference i 've since bought canon 's 15 sheet packs multiple times i now use the kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who do n't care much about the quality of the output , while i save the canon photo paper pro for prints we want to frame
this stick is fantastic for high resolution photos and is lightning quick do you need the extra speed the msx m1gn gives you \? maybe , maybe not but at least you have it when and if you need the feature highly recommend it for the money
those people giving these speakers low reviews because they do n't have enough bass are idiots i do n't know what people expect of these little speakers , but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do these are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels from paris to camping in northern california i cannot imagine going everywhere without them they are not equivalent to a 10k stereo system , but they are not meant to be all i need is my zen touch or zen micro and these speakers do not listen to the other reviews , these speakers will make a decent stereo of your mp3 player enjoy them anywhere
i have used vosky skype call center \( usb07051c 01 \) for about a year now as my only home skype in phone \( paying 3 16 a month \) after getting rid of verizon \( for which i was paying 50 00 a month \)
although i could go on and on about how skype has changed my life forever , i will try to address the issue at hand , and that is the polycom communicator basically i love the concept of the polycom communicator ! when i first started using skype i used a usb headset that works great the problem is that it is a serious pita to put the thing on when someone calls because i have to either a try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection , or b answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord if i chose option a envariably i would miss half the calls , if i chose option b everyone would always comment that i sounded so desheveled when i tried to answer the call well , now with the new polycom communicator all i have to do is answer the call
well , actually i bought this nice cable , at amazon marketplace great offering that it was , for an hdtv tuner , which bombed in my neighborhood so , i never did get to unpack the cable but it 's in the closet , and it knows it 's a good cable great cable , great price , thru amazon
i'm a creative fan so these are the first logitech speakers i ever bought and i was pleasantly surprised i was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive \( and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub woofer \) i decided for this not as portable model
i bought one of these to replace the standard 32mb card that came with my camera wow , now i can store a ton of pictures the price on the ep memory cards are awesome too
i have the quest 2 , but i 've heard that this also fits the quest i bought it because , while my dell laptop backpack is well padded , i wanted to make sure that my quest 2 gps was protected just in case this case fits perfectly , literally like a glove when i got it , i was sceptical it looked to small , but i was wrong the dimensions are perfect and there is more than enough padding to protect the gps from harm , yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket , which i sometimes have to \( late day meetings where i leave my backpack at work \) all in all , it 's another great product from garmin
i have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years it keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn the barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt i wash them down each year and they are like new the fans i have now are on their third barn year in a normal house i'm sure they would last forever they are a little noisy , but the horses do n't care
i purchased this dashmount so i could swap the gps between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount i do n't know what the feet of the base is made of , but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket it is heavy yet is very pliable this is useful since my dash \( a 2004 f 250 \) has an uneven surface i can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it 'll stay there occasionally , on long or bouncy trips , it 'll creep out of position a couple inches and i 'll have to move it back i 've seen some comments complaining of that but i do n't see it as a problem since common sense says it wo n't stay perfectly still since it is n't bolted in place overall this mount has worked very well
i got the dash mount because a friend recommended it i thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield i felt like i should remove it each time i parked somewhere also , there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling the dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to mold to fit the surface of the dash however , it kept slipping off the surface of my toyota avalon until i found a little sticky pad to put it on that solved that problem anyway , it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when i stop , thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber
this is my first hotas , but i did a good bit of research it is very easy to set up , and the sst programming is very helpful setting the shift key the joystick is easy to move , which is nice in a close dogfight i am very glad that i bought this hotas , because i have had no problems with it i highly recommend this system to anyone
for a surge protector but as far as i can tell , it 's doing its job plus it looks kind of neat
we bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming marching this is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice this is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades the drum is a bit heavy , large , cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is loud the cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality do recommend this purchase it does come a bit steep at 30 but is a very nice looking and performing set if you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans , spoil him her with this first class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood
i found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far , other wireless solutions have been marginal i really wondered if the ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the 802 11g would really work
i have had no problems with my mini cruzer usb flash drive it has been recognized without exception by multiple computers and has performed flawlessly
i actually bought this for a friend of my mine he says 'sony never disappoints'
if you 've got a treo 650 , you do n't need a gps device simple as that the smaller than a small filet mignon gps device talks via bluetooth to your 650 , which attaches to your windshield via a well engineered holster the charger charges 'em both , or not , as you see fit the instructions are clear and to the point the installation instructions are slightly out of date you do n't need a card reader to make it happen , after all and the user experience is , in my case , outstanding if you 've got a 650 and you ever drive somewhere unfamiliar , buy it
when i purchased this product a couple weeks ago i wanted to make sure this purchase was worthwhile i studied many other speaker stands and it just did n't seem i would have been getting the same quality
i have this drive and been sucessfully using it with backup on my mac i would recomend it for off line storag
just enough space to save video , photo , music etc all your files in one place and also is compatible with mac i love it
look around in your local electronics stores and you 'll find either hugely expensive players or single tape units
after having used crts roughly the size of small cars for my entire life , i finally jumped on the lcd flatscreen bandwagon this acer 19 lcd makes me happy i did !
monster has went over the top on this thx component video cable instantly noticed a superior picture
e'nuf said epson always leads the way with printers and papers you ca n't go wrong ! ! !
i have bought 2 packages of them , 100 sheet each quite satisfied
i bought this paper after my mom gave me a box of epson 8 5x11 paper she did n't need i was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer when the paper ran out i looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive on the order of 40 cents per page since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter sized sheet of paper , that comes to about 20 cents per print , not counting the cost of ink finally i stumbled upon this paper epson s041727 and the price per print was around 12 cents , which rivals the cheapest internet photo printing services i 've found
hands down epson paper is the best photo paper on the market
this adapter is functional , is easy to use , enables continued use of backlight , and saves the batteries for walking with the emap after arriving in a strange town when i want to connect other media while driving with my family , i use a 12v 3 outlet car power adapter despite another wire , it 's a worthwhile accessory
i have no complaints about this flash drive it does what it should , is easy to use , has enough storage to backup all my digital pics from my hard drive \( so far ! \) , and is not expensive
yup they connect my cable modem to my router , and my router to my computers they transmit data back and forth so far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye so go patch cables \( yay \)
i love it but its been a battle trying to get used to the sensetivity and pressure of holding the pen i'm glad i bought it but it is something i cannot use all the time
this has helped me significantly in drawing in the computer , for programs such as adobe illustrator , adobe photoshop and macromedia flash drawing with a mouse is like drawing with a brick so buy this piece of equipment if you need to draw in the computer !
i bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12 apple powerbook when i work in the dark it works well , and shines impressively bright and wide i even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as i read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book it 's too bad the lamp 's arm is n't telescopic or it 'd make for a perfectly good clip on booklight right out of the box
to really take advandage of this installation was super easy , although i ran into the ti thing like another reviewer oh well not much more i can say about this product it works and that 's all that really matters
i found this device to be relatively easy and comfortable to use \( one handed , no less \) , and accurate to within 15' under tree cover of greater than 90 mature alder and fir once locked onto satellites under clearer overhead conditions in seattle wa and using an external gilsson antenna mounted atop a hat satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times i tried the display is excellent under sunny conditions downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple i have n't used it yet under driving conditions , so i ca n't speak to using related features were it damaged or stolen , i 'd buy another one without hesitation
there are so many times where the actual ink , can be the difference between a good copy , and a not so good copy on paper with hp black ink cartridge 21 , it is very convient , and easy to setup into your hp deskjet 3930 series printer this cartridge is very inexpensive , and affordable for hp printers i think of it as a must for your hp printers while there are cartridges that are difficult to open , and install into your printers , this one installs in a snap i really recommend this for my new hp printer , and so will you if you own a hp printer for this ink as well
it works with all my devices , it has several outputs for your different devices , no complain with it
so far it has been terrific radio and downloads are easy to sort out and use
let 's just say i am 39 and holding and have wanted an mp3 for years my birthday was last week and i bought myslef the pink 4gb nano it is easy to use , but i have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import cd 's , the ipod updates fast but the cd import is slow the sound quality is good i like that it is small and lightweight the screen is bright and easy to read even with not so young eyes i looked at other brands but am glad i went with the leader i did n't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen just tunes i'm sure 1000 songs will hold me
i had been storing my music on a 2gb card in my palm pilot i was having a lot of trouble transferring the music , with many errors , not to mention how long it took to transfer i finally decided to get an mp3 player a friend kept telling me about the sandisk sanso there were some great features , but the bad far , far outweighed the good too many of the same problems over and over , and many people returning them
well the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price , and amazon com has beaten every on line price i have seen as for the toner itself , hewlett packard toner is top i buy this product for two reasons , 1 it 's what fits in my printer , and 2 i know when i buy the c3906a , i am getting what i payed for , a quality cartrige that lasts one last note , twords the end of the cartrige life , a small line appears in the content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one simply shake the cartrige , reorder , and by the time the new one arrives , the old one is finished
i'm not much of a techie but , i do have lots of documents and pictures that i ca n't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day
i ordered the apple ipod shuffle sport case because i wanted something to protect my ipod from the elements and just general bumping and scraping it works great , and you can use your ipod without taking it out of the case i have n't taken my ipod out of the case except to charge it , or to change my playlist it 's a must have item for anyone with an ipod shuffle
after reading the dec '04 review in computer pilot i ordered it fine tuning is a bit involved but repetition makes the curve easier configuring from one a c type throttle to another is easy with the downloadable manager from ch prod compared to the goflight modular system this is great value unless is no object and you 're not interested in building a home cockpit , the ch line of av sim controls is well suited to the aspiring and advaced flt simmer
i have had my pocket pc for quite some time now , and i love the convenience that it offers
i found out the way to copy photos from my compactflash card onto the ipaq it 's not hard but more complex than necessary i also found out how to send the ipaq in to have its screen replaced a hassle its screen and or stylus should work together so they do n't produce scratches in the first place
excellent service , five days is all i had to wait and saved a lot of money could n't be happier
i also ordered the antec sx 1030 \( which has yet to be shipped ! arrgghh ! ! \) according to antec , the 1030 includes 2 fans , but has space for 2 more , which is where this one comes in ! for those of you wondering what size small is , it 's an 80mm fan good airflow \( do n't know actual cfm \) and pretty quiet
i'm a d link refugee and this card has been just great my home connection has been very good , i'm in a basement and have no idea where the router is !
i had originally bought a linksys , without doing any research beforehand thinking all routers were more or less equal oops ! hardware was poor , the interface was wonky , customer service was a joke i was re booting it every few minutes under moderate usage , because it keep dropping my dsl connection or completely locking up i just replaced it with a dgl 4300 based on all the positive reviews , and have been very happy so far i do n't need or use any of the advanced features for gaming but already i 've been very impressed with the dgl 4300 since it has n't dropped any connections since i bought it last week you get what you pay for
i do n't get why other mounts cost twice as much i bought this to hang my 42 panasonic and it is great can someone tell me why the omnimount costs so much more \? i do n't see any functionality differences and with the mustang tilt mount , i have been tilting it at least 10 times for either adjustments or disconnecting reconnecting cables it is so simple
i got this phone about 1 month ago and i like all the features of the phone , volume control , caller id , large display window and you can add up to 10 more hand set
handy traveler accessory retractable usb cord very nice had a small problem with moto adapter , one of the locking pins would not release was able to get release wire reseated under release button and all working fine now
i found this on clearance at another retailer \( i guess not everyone likes pink \) , and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for skinny armed people , but not so ! i 've got plenty of room , it fits great , and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way , though makes mowing the lawn way more fun
i have been a dj for a almost 5 years , and this are the best headphones i 've ever had the h250 headphones are light , confortable , and great acustic properties it is true that the bass is a little loud , but thats exactly what you need if you 're playing in loud and crowded clubs
when i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts considering the price of it i just could n't see it holding up for what i wanted to do to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations for recording vocals this mic is amazing a real professional sound for a extremely low price i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material
i have some decent mics in my cabinet , as well as a nice preamp , a d converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup i was n't expecting as good or better quality than i can already get , but i hoped the samson c01b usb studio condenser would at least give me a decent sound the idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits i was not disappointed installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a usb port on my laptop running xp and the other end into the mic it is far from the best mic i have , but it is certainly not the worst i have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin , but i found that not to be the case the noise floor when recording with the samson is a little high , and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my millenia preamp i have to record at slightly lower levels than i am used to , but for 79 , i am not complaining there is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in fasoft n track studio the ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating way to go , samson
could n't get any sw stations , but am and fm worked great and the hand crank charged up the cell phone , after a lot of cranking
no problems so far does its job \( if you are setting up a wireless network , get windows xp 1 click and you 're set up
i bought this to scare away the opossums that come into my back porch at night i used a 3 prong adapter with this to plug in a lamp and a radio
product wise , the card has worked fine , but then memory cards generally either work or they do n't product was shipped in a timely manner , and the price was reasonable
originally purchased to supplement provide a tangle free connection to
very good case for the price actually looks more expensive ca n't go wrong
i wanted a case that was small , slim , and just carried the laptop perfect ! i have a briefcase for files i did n't need anything bulky this case was exactly what i was looking for , for the right price i have a new gateway tablet p c and with the larger battery and battery placement , this is a snug fit , but at least i know the computer is n't loose inside i really like this case
cuando compr una toshiba satellite m105 con pantalla de 14 , eleg este maletin porque lei que sus dimensiones se ajustaban al equipo el interior est forrado y cuenta con las divisiones suficientes para llevar el cargador y los cables de poder de la notebook asimismo puedo incluir documentos , mouse y otros accesorios el asa es c moda y la correa incluida es ancha y ajustable al largo que uno desee estoy satisfecho con esta compra
the 6500b was the last one i tried of three i 've had cordless panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again but the other choices had major drawbacks i really needed a two line phone that was n't 2 4ghz
i love my new monster fm transmitter ! it 's very easy to use and the reception is great
besides all opion regarding this new calculator , i would like to say , it is very nice , good design , options , features , a huge screen and modern color so far , i have n't navigate deep inside it , it is not similar as 48gx , so you 've got to expend some time to know how to use it i bought it since there is not a better calculator than this \( 48gx is unique but obsolete
easy to install , gret price and now i have surround sound on my pc woowho
i thought i was going to have to try to track down some headphones for kids until i ran across these ! they are super comfortable and seem to block the world out i 've been using them for about 3 months now and could n't be happier eventhough i 've got a healthy dose of ear wax building up on them
this is n't my first mp3 player i have a couple of the years and since my last one died i was looking for a quick , cheap replacement i also needed a flash drive for work do n't underestimate this , if you use the net at a library or cafe then you 'll realize that 1 not all players drives are recognized as drives and or 2 you 've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port , which gets annoying quickly when you clean out your purse and discover you do n't have it with you with this you get both in one it has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems , even win98 the sound quality is good , i ca n't tell the difference between this and my 100 00 player the controls do take a few seconds to get used to , but once i did i find i preferred them they are easy to use one handed
i decided to purchase this item because i needed to get sd memory for my g friends digital camera , so i chose this one because of the price and the brand sandisk is known for their memory well , no need to say more , this thing works great i will buy another one but with more space anyday thanks alot san disk
just got this one at sears , and was only 20 so i grabbed it the canon a400 i have only came with 16mb so i needed more space the 128 is much faster and easy to format than my old one love it ! ! ! go out and buy one today ! get sandisk not lexar , they break all the time ! ! ! ! !
how many pictures will it store \? it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well , considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries
if you buy this service plan , print out the contract \( found at the top of this page \) and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan , but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it
there is absolutely nothing that we do n't like about these panasonic phones the sound quality is excellent as is the range very happy customers
i have had mine for a week i had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years , which was misplaced i bought the navigation kit at the same time i ordered a 60 cs it makes what i bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies i had no problems loading software and maps , upload or download from to my gps
three months later , i'm still amazed at how cheap this amazing piece of hardware was granted , it does n't vibrate , nor have a zillion buttons , but it definitely performs admirably it is comfortable and the buttons respond well the unit feels well built , and connects to the computer easily via usb and as a bonus , it looks pretty too
i bought this based on the overall positive reviews good sound quality , and a comfortable fit i did n't find them to be too tight at all for a low end pair of headphones , i think they 're pretty impressive
the cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit i must say they are very comfortable if you dont like them at first wear them for a while , they will grow on you
if you went to circuit city , you would see this is 30 there here its only 8 99 ! with fast shipping i only paid about 16 total , half the price of circuit city those type of stores \( best buy , circuit city , compusa \) are a total ripoff when it comes to these cables buy from amazon com \( eektech will ship \) and you save lots of thanks eek for great service
works great , good quality from belkin as usual hard to beat for the money
i'm using the product as i respond to this request for a review sufficiently compact for ease of packing in my laptop case no technical issues \( so far \) tracking is excellent has worked flawlessly under daily working conditions recommend highly
this mouse works perfectly fast and easy without problems even if you do n't install the software
as the title states , this is an excellent wireless mouse works right away with windows xp , no driver install or software needed for two button and normal scroll capabilities software allows for extra button assignment , but could use some work i have had some trouble finding the menus i want when i want to find them for example , i have an issue where i cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the usb receiver after a system start up , however i am able to find those menus in the software if i remove and reinsert the receiver
the v200 is another great logitech product it is far from the king of the mouse , but when it comes to the notebook it does n't get much better than this it takes two aa batteries \( so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs \) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots the mouse does n't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves this is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel with the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do overall the design is good there could be a problem installing setpoint it may hang on install if so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again it should work the usb receiver is 2 4 ghz and has a 10 meter range wow however there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook usb dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off for this reason you should have the usb receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand , if you can , to avoid accidental contact it should also not be hanging over the edge of the table if you press it down lightly , then that is it , game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2 4 ghz receiver so okay you will have to spend on a new receiver , if you break the old one the receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet when it is in the holder the mouse turns off it does n't fit in smoothly it creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in the other thing is that it can pop out sometimes just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way i am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices if you are then a mouse like this and usb should last for a very long time there is really nothing wrong with it wireless mini mouse fab ! however there is one last thing to say if you do n't like the idea of a usb receiver then get a bluetooth version of this mouse instead it is called the v270 that is if your notebook has internal bluetooth or else you will need to get a bluetooth usb receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your usb receivers but if you have a bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the v270 and forget about this usb option the usb design is n't a fault with the mouse it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault you just got to switch to internal bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers
when i purchased this product i was a little sceptical , however , once i unpacked it and started using it , it was so absolutely easy to use , and the pictures have such a fine quality , and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection so , i see it as a win win product the only draw back is the weight and size i just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel
first and foremost i am not an audiophile , so i ca n't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves they are fine for me and my listening habits i find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine , although when i do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me
it 's been through the wringer , and has had no problems after about a year i came here looking for a replacement cap , but ca n't find one on amazon
i downloaded the driver from trendnet 's website before installing the adapter i did not encounter any problems at all , including the issue that some users had with it disconnecting when they plugged in another usb device
the sennheiser hd600s have only one thing wrong with them they 'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio into an audiophile ! i 've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top av forums , but i 've always been satisfied with merely decent audio until now
having been a buyer of sennheiser products for over 10 years , i feel it is time i endorse a product i truly believe in , and have never been let down by including service and customer satisfaction
i just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit i had no problem at all in fact it was quite simple i am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is for the price , you ca n't beat it
i bought the transcend 1 gbyte card for my pda my axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks i am planning to get the 4gb model too which is currently retailing for 90 to 110 elsewhere
i was mislead with amazon review which said it supports conversion to mp3 format with the software supplied , it does not the help quite clearly states you cannot convert a file into an mp3 file it will convert to wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to mp3
this is the same cartridge i can purchase elsewhere , but cheaper it works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my hp printer prints fantastic photos when i use hp ink and hp premium photo paper
no complaints i'm pleased with the quality and price
before i bought this device , i was trying to enjoy the hearts of space website , this american life and other npr shows available for online streaming only problem was , i did n't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them i did some research on the internet , read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the logitech wireless music system i would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here
the hp12c has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years i bought my first one when i was a consultant and it lasted until august 2006 it withstood all the travel and constant use well i use it for simple and complex math statistical analysis and financial analysis it is much faster and simpler to operate than a pc my new one has all the same great features i highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis
i bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now the nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works , it works beautifully when it does n't work , it is erratic and locks up turn it on and off and while the led will light up , it will still not work well this is the hint that the battery is low the mouse comes with two rechargable nimh aaa batteries these are 650mah batteries and are not the best i bought 4 1000mah accupower nimh batteries i keep 2 in the charger these batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day but as soon the mouse starts to get erratic , you have to swap the batteries do this and you will really like this mouse
this is a great printer i have used it several times and it makes great pictures i had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great tried this on a regular printer and the print did n't look near as great a great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have you can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards
the camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use it 's multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which i personally expected i have a complete satisfaction
although the rear speakers need a power plug , this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front the sound is ok , not awesome , but not bad better than the tv speakers by a long shot they can also be nicely controlled with my harmony remote
very good , worth the money if you want a louder one , go for z 535
never been game player much since pong purhcased bf2 last december for the pc and loved it flying was limited though util i purchased my g7 from ne and have been enjoying mucho fast speeds , easily adjusted , and for internet parusing it has a built in back button have to change out battery every two days but gives plenty of warning and is always charged when i need to replace absolutely the best mouse i have ever owned
i love this keyboard
i have been into mp3s since 1996 i used winplay , and l3enc , and thought it was the most amazing thing ever i bought one of the first cd based mp3 players , and then a nomad jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk next was the 10 gig model , and then i upgraded to the nomad zen 20gig with usb 2 0 the zen went with me everywhere africa , europe , my living room
this is my first time ever buying a really expensive mp3 player i bought it three weeks ago if i had n't seen the creative zen vision m , i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa e260 i love being able to bring my cartoon tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv there is one problem i 've had with it i'm not sure if anyone else has had this , but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i'm listening to music i do n't think it 's the mp3s , because i 've never ran into the problem with my other mp3 players if only they would 've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger , then i would 've rated it a 5
bought this dvd player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since it has many features and a good picture you ca n't beat the large screen i like the zoom feature especially another feature i like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you do n't have a bulky protrusion when it 's attached the sound is not loud as others have said but i have yet to find a portable dvd player that has good sound you 'll have to use external speakers or ear phones \( included \) another thing i notice is that dvd rw or dvd r are not supported they play but the menu system does not work you have to access the file manually that being said i cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than 299 the shipping was fast and free there is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold as is but the unit i got was brand new and not refurbished so far so good i do n't thonk you will be disappointed
i have been using this card for last 6 months , no problem so far rebate takes some time to arrive
i was really pushing the limits of my mid range monster surge protector with 2 tvs , a 2 4gig p4 with desktop tv , dsl , two printers , and drumroll please a fridge all crammmed into a corner office setup about 7' wide the belkin gold unit with rf emi suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers , satellite signal , the dirty line into my modem , and a week later i have n't had to reboot my system once amazing !
i bought this recorder to use as backup for real time event video recording i have also used it concert settings the record quality is astounding , full range of dynamics , using both the stereo mini plug input and the 1 4 inputs it is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio first thing i did was to upgrade to a 4gb compactflash card the provided card is too limited
i am glad i bought this backpack it exceeded all my expectations i strongly recommend this one
built very sturdy , with no flimsy plastic parts
i got this less robust remote because i only wanted to use it on one system and i was able to set it up and program all the different buttons , and it all fits nicely in my hand they have great customer support available on the weekends the best part is everything goes on and off with one button !
i must say moster xp speaker wire makes a huge sound inprovement on mt 6 1 home theater setup my side and rear channels are so clear and crisp
i am a soldier serving in iraq i bought an ipod while deployed and figured it would get ruined by the dirt , dust and my combat duties i was fortunate to find the iskin eclipse it is perfect for this environment it completely encases the ipod to protect it from dirt and dust it also has a hard exterior faceplate the protects the ipod from damage
it helps proteck your ipod veary well i already broke one ipod some how but with this case it well never happen agai
ok , so i upgraded form a 30 inch lcd to a 50 plasma screen , all the sales guys kept trying to get me to buy a power center i came home did some research and chose this one , if it did n't improve sound or picture at least i knew that the equipment was protected from power surges
needed better protection than my 10 surge protector for my ht setup now that i have a couple dvrs a plasma filtering would be a nice side benefit too very little more than the power strip design units i was looking at \( now i see it dropped even lower ! \)
actually 4 and a half stars i borrowed one of these logic3 amplified ipod speaker systems for a weekend camping trip and was impressed with the sound and portability i decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most ipod models securely the little subwoofer and 'ambiance' switch make decent sound even at non annoyingly low volume levels close to being a steal at the 59 00 i paid for i
excellent sound from phones and microphone comfortable on head and ears plenty of cable on cable controls are handy
i was looking for something suitable to house my sansa , and this fit the bill better than most the leather case is superb , looking sharp , snug and protective i enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back , if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it the cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth , great for cleaning the screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles , still have n't figured out how yet , and i may trim it to make it more visually appealing but , really , if you invest in a product such as this , it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen ! the larger case is compact and protective , having a small storage area , yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap , generic looking sansa logo only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt , but not as a removable type only if you put it on when putting on the belt , which can be impractical in some circumstances this way , i suppose , it would n't be able to fall off
i wasnt sure how these iron ons would work since one of the ratings on them was negative but i just did a practice iron on on my daughters shirts it was so easy and they peeled off very well my girls love their shirts with their own pictures on them these are a great buy and worth their money
while thinking of ideas for my church 's 75th anniversary celebration , i decided to make t shirts and sweatshirts using iron on transfers and my ink jet printer i chose the invent it ! quot brand from hammermill papers because it was the most cost effective \( cheapest \) i created the design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper the results were outstanding for a do it yourself project i followed the instructions included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake one thing that i did find out keep the transfers dry after they have been printed one got wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in contact this product also does a very good job in black and white , not just in color the shirts that i did , laundered according to the instructions , came out of the wash lookin' good i wo n't hesitate to use this product again in the future however , i am now having trouble buying it locally , since my previous source no longer handles this product
we purchased the ysp 1 in august as a companion to our hitachi ultravision wall mounted television what a fabulous piece of audio equipment !
you bought the ipod nano basically for its looks buy this for the same reason its so cute and fits your nano exactly as you wish i bought an item from another company and though it was cheaper , it looked dirty on my computer table this one has the apple look
i chose these by reading other reviews on amazon i am pleased with them and recommend them good sound , light weight the best feature is that they do not leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you this is perfect for an ipod using nyc subway rider do n't want to annoy others by leaking sound , but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise , at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what 's going on
these ear buds are great for people with small ears i 've tried several and these are by far the best it comes with 3 sizes of buds and the smallest work best for me
this is a terrific phone it has a ton of great features and the three handsets is very convenient this is the only phone that i use now i only keep one analog phone for power outages if you 're looking to clean up a little bit of phone clutter this is a great way to do it
we are very satisfied with our purchase this phone system is great and very easy to use super clarity , volume , etc also , super fast shipping from amazon i chose super saver shipping and it arrived in less than 24 hours
i saw the other reviews and was hoping i would have the same experience as the happy reviewers well , i got the cam and it was easy to install like they say it just takes a little tinkering , with the pc options before you use it with the mic and software it comes with , you get a lot for your money ! if i bought a cam in the store , i would have been mad to lose out on this pc camera it is sweet
ok mimo is becomming popular i dont give a darn
this extension cord did what it was supposed to do and did it just fine no problems whatsoever
as soon as i bought this from amazon , the price went up from 21 to 37 i was going to buy another one , but the price is too high overall , this is a great product it has everything you need
work fine with my hp pavillion zd7050 increase the performance of my laptop
i tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the e3c 's , but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor , and they were uncomfortable the yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications they effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable although they seem a bit expensive i 've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them just soak , squeeze , rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new you can do this three or four times , then just toss them away
once the speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage , klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that did n't know the real value of what they 'd bought but after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles , klipsch is back on top , from a sound quality standpoint and it shows in the promedia 2 1 thx
this splitter was set up as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house i used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through , and the results were amazing the picture quality is crystal clear , even when almost all of the ports are in use , and the internet is blazing fast compared to the set up we used to have , with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier , these pieces are well worth the small extra cost
these cables are super with my new dvd player there is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment the picture is soo clear , and vivid the cables themselves are really made well , they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt if you get these monster cables you wo n't be sorry
i previously had a 2 1 sound system for my computer , that were pretty good a few years ago when i bought them when i decided to replace them with these i was rather happy with my choice the sound is extremely clear and crisp , whether it be music or games , and i am very pleased with them the only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk , but you have to expect that with a 5 1 sound system
i am glad i bought this backpack it exceeded all my expectations i strongly recommend this one
these are really great super noise cancelling affordable they cover my ears completely without problem at first , the headset was a bit tight , so i stretched the top headband upwards a little to relax or slightly loosen it no more problem , while still having a snug fit these headphones also fold up very compact , have two plug adapters and a nice durable sack for storage
i am happy with my purchase i only bought it because i do n't like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones i would not use this product to entertain at a party , but it serves my needs
on a recent trip , i was 23 hours in transit and could n't have made it without this little device it powered my movies and tv shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker i was worried that the four aa batteries would make it heavy to carry but it did n't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table besides , it was comforting to know that aa batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world by the way , i substituted the original batteries with duracells on the advice of previous reviewers
i bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to italy and i am very happy with it i never had to change my batteries once and i listened to it all the time reading other people 's reviews i threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great the only complaint i have is the suction cups are n't that great several times my ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun
i have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control i experienced the same thing until i realized that i mistaken the up down buttons with the buttons the volume works just fine on my wife 's old sony receiver the remote is quite nice and it does everything the ipod control could do as stated in others' reviews , you ca n't read the screen from a distance , thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless however , it would be worse if the remote could n't scroll through menus
i'm really happy with this purchase i was worried that it would not work with rhapsody \( which is the media player i use the most \) , but it proved to work well with it in fact , it works with all the media player i 've thrown at it , including windows media player , medialife , realplayer , itunes , rhapsody , divx player , windvd , and powerdvd
it would seem , even to a non tech , that someone has switched your uniden mobile base tech data around secondly , terms such as standard mean less than trustworthy when applied to sensitivity and selectivity please do n't feel i berate these 2 fine products however as i am a com tech i would like the actual bench test measurements for an informed recom purchases also i would like to know if cobra 1000 or 2000 series are availible as they still have the best selectivity and sensitivity that i have had on my bench yet thank yo
until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound , these were my favorite pair of earphones they were comfortable \( i often left them in when i went to sleep \) , affordable , lightweight , durable , and had good sound quality i used them with my sony cfd v5 boombox , my oritron op5034 portable cd player , and my rca rp2410 mp3 cd player on all three , bass and detail was great , and there was no distortion at a higher volume all in all , these earphones were a great value the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound , which i got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones \( it lent a bit of warmth to the music \) i plan to buy another pair in the near future , and i highly recommend that you do so as well
ordering was fast and easy could not detect any inferiority in the cartridges and will order them again
i received it today , and it 's a monster if you 've seen one in a store , it looks twice as big on your desk until a few hours ago , i was running two 20 aluminum cinema displays on a pny 6600gt after doing online research about using the 30 display under windows xp , i found that the functional cheap solution being used is in fact the pny 6600gt \( verto 128mb ddr3 with two dvi connectors \) considering that the other two most noted solutions , quadrofx 4000 agp or parhelia dl256 pci , are going for 600 on ebay , i was willing to give my old beater a try besides , i did n't feel like buying another agp card with pcie taking over the world , or sacrificing the only pci slot in my shuttle xpc \( sb75g2 \)
this screen is great
outstanding item plenty of room to carry dvds enough padding to protect the player , but not too bulky
i ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by garmin but they shipped v7 instead six weeks later i got the v8 update dvd my wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in madrid she was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence however , she noted that madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways in the end , she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re calculate her route
if you understand this product 's limits before you buy it , you 'll be happy it shows topographical contours , rivers and most streams for the entire united states in addition to that , it shows roads that were in existance 10 20 years ago these major roads are also named
i am very pleased with my purchase of the envision en 7100 monitor it arrived in perfect condition , no dead pixels i resisted spending the money on a new monitor for a long time , but now i'm glad i made the switch to lcd the color and clarity is wonderful most of all , i love having all this extra space on my desk for the money , this is a great monitor
i just recently bought a sony dvp s560d model dvd player to replace my older , more out of date player i hooked it up , and to my surprise , it was n't any better than my old player as far as quality then i purchased s video cables from monster video and now the colors are more vibrant , the picture is in higher res , and i can see every little detail on the screen the picture quality that these s video cables produce are surpassed only by component video cables , which cost many times more the price if you are considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of only one dvd , you can get better performance and picture quality
i wanted to thank amazon for their quick response to my first order not arriving within a week they sent me another i have been using it everyday , and have not gotton lost i install wood flooring in nj pa ny , works like a charm i use it with my palm treo 700p
for the most part , i do find hp ink to be the best however , every now and then a new ink cartridge is bad one of the colors does n't print for some reason my opinion is that these ink cartridges are just too expensive to be getting any bad ones
i used this card on my nokia n70 for storing mp3 files granted i ca n't fit my entire music collection on it , but if i wanted to , i 'd buy an ipod this is perfect for listening to my favourite songs on the go , as well as taking pictures and video clips ! highly recommended
i purchased this product to use with my camera the charging lasts very good time would recommend this product to others good work amazon
i love sound systems so when i got my new reciever \( sony str de898 b \) i hooked up the new speaker wires with the thx certified gold plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference i miscalculated how much wire i needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire , i can hear a light and day difference in sound quality needless to say i'm ordering more to complete the job the monster fiber optic cable is a must as well i can hear sounds that i normally could n't on my old system i like testing sound with the hulk \( the scene were he tears up the tanks \) , saving private ryan \( taking the beach \) , and open range \( gunfight at the end of the movie \) in all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that i could not before the new wire and connectors excellent product
this is my first mp3 player so i researched it carefully before making my decision the gorgeous screen , the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points i'm so glad i bought it videos look great on the screen some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general i love it the built in speaker does n't do it justice even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing making playlists with the creative software is very easy my biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it no case , no screen protectors out for it i 'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do but for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the ipod or the zune
this adapter can not be used with the garmin 330
a little bouncy while running , but a convenient product fits perfectly around all of my mp3 players \( large and small \)
this is a great phone memory is easy to progam the phone has 3 memory keys for emergenies and 9 additional memory keys for personal numbers it can be used on a desk or hung on the wall the only thing i do n't like about the phone is the buttons on the handset however , i knew about this feature before purchasing the phone i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a good basic phone
i did a lot of research on amazon com before i finally decided on this mouse i wanted to replace my \( extremely \) small kensington usb mouse with a retractable cable at home , i use a wacom tablet next month i am traveling abroad , so i wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the kensington wireless was key for portability i also wanted something rechargeable , and i did n't want the usb adapter sticking out
this card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use
i have to admit , i'm a gps junkie i 've had a variety of gps units over the past decade and currently own 3 the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving
this paper works excellent in the hp series printers i have tryed many other makes of photo paper and they just do n't cut it some other makes do n't dry in a timely manner , others have a dull finish them , some have a red tone this hp photo paper allows you to print store developed quality photos from your hp printer you get what you pay for this product is worth the money
i 've used this card for a while now and i 'd say that i like it overall the power usage is great the drivers have been vastly improved and now you are able to scan for networks those of you who are interested in wardriving should look elsewhere if you want to use netstumbler or pocketwarrior in windows or kismet and airsnort in linux , either go for the linksys wcf12 \( prism based \) or lucent orinoco based pcmcia card if you 're looking to run just 802 11b and check email , stream music , browse the web , etc , this card will be perfect plus it 'll save you some battery power
i am a typical college student , i am not a photgrapher to be or anything , so this digital card was perfect for me i get about 330 pictures on my second best setting and have never come close to taking that many pictures i believe this card is great for anyone who is not obessed with taking pictures , or to someone who loads them on quickly
easy to use , nice \( in appearance \) , very comfortable \( lots of space \) and at an excellent price ! i highly reccomend it
i recommend this product ! is an excellent purchase option excellent product quality in performance and looks no product out there in the market looks as good as this one
the sound is fine , but the mic is not so good , too much background noise the headset is quite loose but it 's ok when you get used to it
these are the only earphones worth buying for your ipod i tried to get some cheapies after i lost my originals , but they were horrible these are a little expensicve , but so worth it
i'm using them a lot never failed keeping up to 16x speed
high quality disks never a bad burn fast delivery buy this from this selle
i opened it , i put it in my psp and that was it i had plenty of space on the memory stick and i personally did n't have to do any special formatting i just popped it in and that was it
easy to install and use but the remote does not have an on off switch
the cd player works well , just wish the random play would work for all of the cd 's instead of only one
the product is fine however when i ordered i added a gift card to the payment the gift card was not used and the purchase was paid in full with my credit card is my gift card still valid
the microsoft optical wheel mouse is a great product it is worth every penny of the purchase price a great value ! it is so much better than my old mouse with the ball in it the optical wheel mouse is much more accurate too the best purchase i ever made
great quality i had a problem initially with xp media center compatibilty , but it works now after downloading an update from logitech 's website recently , the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country i think it might just be her interet connection though \( we both have the same web cam \) as long as we restart the video call , then the sound comes back i am using windows live messenger as the video call program i have never used the cartoons that it comes with the video quality is very good when recording a video for email
the headset works great , comfortable i just wish they had better sound quality for instance when playing music
i bought these headphones on the recommendation of a friend , and he was sooo right ! the moment when the noice cancelling algorithm kicks in on a noisy flight is just sublime i frequently use them without input , just tuning out the background noise on the aircraft they even work well on squalling rug rats a few rows away
this amplifier works as stated increased my modem downstream from 7 to 9 no obvious loss of noise ratio and upstream signals all tv channels are much sharper ! the cables came with the amplifier are two rg59 cable lines for minimum loss of broadband signals , i suggest you replace one of them with r6 cable to carry the cable signals use the rg59 for the power supply only
if you want very basic capability this is the wireless adapter for you slow but steady and inexpensive
i bought this for my tivo , hooked it up the day it arrived and have n't touched it since great value
people buy expensive av cables because of most people would think that more expensive cables will work better and last longer i 've found that it 's more a matter of quality control i 'll roll the dice with cheap \( price \) cables untill they fail on me
great cable that works as advertised why spend 80 on a name brand cable which performs no better or no worse connected a third gen mot 6412 dvr with hd to a sony 36xbr800 great picture a name brand cable will not transmit your digital signal 6' any better than this cables unlimited brand will
the only thing you will need when you buy this package is some extra paper ! i love the fact that epson advertises realistic figures for this package some other printer makers do not do this !
i installed the roady in my car a few days ago my wife has a xm radio in her new vehile so i was some what familiar with the xm radio the only reason i did n't give the roady 5 stars was that the signal to the indash radio is poor on the front of my in dash stereo there is a aux input which i plugged my roady into and the roady plays crystal clear , however this connected is not mentioned in the roady instruction manual i have three vehicles and all three have an aux input on the front of the cd player that i plug my mp3 player into xm radio was running a special and i got the unit and the car kit for 40 00 all in all the roady is awesome
i have purchased these and other rechargeable batteries in the past generally i like the powerex batteries the best , but these energizer batteries have really outdone the others the seem to have the best capacity and last the longest of all the batteries i have i have used them in my canon s2 is digital camera and have taken over 400 pictures during a weeklong vacation with no problems , and no recharging during the vacation
there 's no need to take anybody else 's word for specs on this sony dvd player when you can view or download , for free , the user 's manual at http esupport sony com us perl model documents pl \? mdl dvpns90v loc 3 i 've been running this sony dvp ns90v player through a sony widescreen hdtv and a pioneer amplifier receiver for several days now , and i find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers one , for example , states that there is no bass management , yet you can \( a \) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting small or large for the front speaker size \( see page 76 of the user 's manual \) , and also \( b \) increase or decrease the bass from 15 db to 5 db \( see page 77 of the manual \) whether you prefer analog to digital audio , or you think sacd 's are tops , is a matter of opinion , taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit i , for one , prefer dvd audio , and i mention this for an important reason some product ads and the user 's manual clearly warn that this unit will not play dvd audio discs happy surprize it most certainly will ! for my dvd a 's that have optional dolby 5 1 and or dts tracks , the player simply ignores the primary dvd a format \( normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors \) but still plays the dolby or the dts via the digital audio \( optical or coaxial \) connectors for pure dvd a 's \( without dolby 5 1 or dts tracks \) , it conveniently outputs the audio both via the 6 analog and the digital connectors and in all cases above , the audio is full multi channel surround , and not downmixed to 2 channel pcm , nor prologic pseudo surround the only dvd a function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on dvd a 's , and so displays only the jacket image onscreen the quick setup allows any dvd newbie to be up and running in a short time and the custom setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble shooters that it 's bound to please even the high end audio video geek freaks in short , you 'll find this to be a superior universal player , provided you read the user 's manual \( all 84 pages of it ! \) , follow it , and connect equally high quality , compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features
what it has that the xr55 does not hdmi , dual amping of front mains now available during 5 1 playback , one extra set of component inputs , and all channel stereo \( called party mode on other receivers \)
this is the second brother hl 2070n printer i ve owned the first died during a storm and i forgot about electrical surges the only negative on this printer is a slight curling of the pages it is fast and reliable the prints are crystal clear i would recommend this product to everyone
much cheaper than other sony machine works fine then again , i was n't looking for anything fancy do n't have problems with the speakerphone or message recording as the others did i like the dual keypads
i 've had my epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent i run exclusively on linux \( currently gentoo \) and the linux support for this printer \( using cups \) is superb all modes , resolutions , etc are supported i use this printer a lot for engineering work printing b size \( tabloid \) drawings and it works great for that
having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far , i can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results the drivers at least for mac os x are easy to understand and reliable the ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing , is a vey nice touch as well however , it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me by using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings , one can get nice rich colors that are on cue thus this printer makes good for doing proofs as an artist and graphic designer , having this quality is a blessing since this print cost 400 at the time of parchase compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from 2000 on up also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers the only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1 2 x 11 printer also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey but what inkjet dose n't have that problem \? anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often so any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it , the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job so i'm giving 5 stars on the epson 128
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally , the dvi d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a dvi d cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few \( very few \) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of hdmi , nobody really makes them anymore
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand
the sennheiser hd 205 is great value for money the design is not only comfortable , but takes out a lot of ambient noise this headphone does not have active noise reduction but does a good job with its closed design headphone
i bought this phone at amazon , and i am happy with it provides very good sound quality , comfortable navigation , address book and caller id with its 5 8 ghz frequency speed , it is much better than my previous one which was panasonic 2 4ghz and did not have light signal on handset when you have a new message
takes a little time to start operating , very good for the price a little trouble using it inside ca
this simple device is reliable for fixing positions and if you know about coordinates , you can set it in , and bingo you can compensate what it lacks of by using coordinates from a map while you paid unexpensive
what a wonderful surprize it took about ten minutes to install them to my hp media center computer they replace speakers that came with my 19 monitor which were lousy to say the least \( speaker make with held \) but the vs 4121s surpassed all my expectations while i am not an audiophile , i do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job i do n't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better suffice to say i am completely satsfied and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their moneys worth
this was a breeze to setup , even with wpa2 to ensure privacy i also hooked up an xbox360 and it has never failed in since i bought it about 6 month ago
having a tv in the car make the carpool commute a little easier obviously , the driver ca n't watch it , but the passengers can all of the chords and connectors are included great price
this is my first time ever buying a really expensive mp3 player i bought it three weeks ago if i had n't seen the creative zen vision m , i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa e260 i love being able to bring my cartoon tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv there is one problem i 've had with it i'm not sure if anyone else has had this , but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i'm listening to music i do n't think it 's the mp3s , because i 've never ran into the problem with my other mp3 players if only they would 've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger , then i would 've rated it a 5
earlier this week i received the factory referbished samsung hd841 i have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players , mainly my philips 642 , which have been excellent players for me this model does well i do n't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw note , this model has the dvi output , if your tv has an hdmi port , you will want to check out the samsung hd 850 \( identical otherwise \) first , this model has component , composite and s video hook ups , as well as the dvi port \( still have to run seperate sound out with dvi \) also , this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5 1 thx many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models the picture quality is great , at 480p comparable with my philips again , the upconvert works well out the dvi hook up to my tv , but to be honest , it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player , at least on my tv which is a 23 720p lcd menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well the user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing , in fact , it does not have an index but , it the main thing is that the player is does perform well , and is a name brand product from samsung \( i have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems \) this player also appears to have divx available on it , not noted in the product discription , so that was a suprise as well this will allow the use of mp4 movie files the remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players , but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus in all , i will continue to explore this new player , but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack so give it a chane , the prices are good currently , quality has been good , and it is a samsung
this was one of the cheapest tv mounts and it had all the options the expensive ones had it will pull away from the wall as well as allow the screen to pivot up and down it also compacts up close to the wall
there is a light that always stays on and it is distracting , as others have noted otherwise , it is great good design , works well , no complaints but that light why did they design it with that \?
protects the garmin 's 60 screen from scratches , but interferes with the button operations a little worth the hassle to protect the screen
this unit works very well and we are very pleased with it nice construction , good sound quality on both ends we 're concerned about battery life as in of recharges before performance decreases , but no indication right now that is an issue i would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper this class of device is overpriced in general amazon 's price was very good , but overall still seems over priced i would definately buy another from amazon as these are 25 more at other places
this cable does improve the image quality but not by much i was dissappointed to see very little difference between my standard ps2 stock cable and the moster cable i bought this is not to say that the monster cable is bad , but it just is n't worth the asking price if you see on for under 20 then i recommend picking it up , but other than that , just avoid them because there is n't much better out there
breaking news if you are buying a new video playback capable ipod , please look for the new ipod universal dock , which has s video output for both photos and video it is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your ipod from your sofa
i bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items i need to carry back and forth \( umbrella , lunch , spare battery , paper , etc \) it 's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally i was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward , but it 's not
this bag is fantastic , comfortable to carry , fits loads in , protects my laptop , doubles as hand luggage no complaints at all best bag i 've ever bought
seems nowadays everything uses aaa batteries so this 30 pack is perfect for just about anyone that needs them you know who you are the ones with the video games , remote controls , clocks , and whatever else you need expecially good to get during the holidays , you should never be without
received it pretty quick , but it was sdsdqu 1024 e10m there is n't any difference just it comes from europe instead of the u s that was pretty odd but otherwise it works
my experience , with several repetitions the adapter , continuously plugged in , continuously on , works for about 10 days , then stops working and drops the connection it wo n't restart the only way to recover is to unplug it , plug in your spare \( you do have a spare , of course \) , and let the netgear wg111t cool off for a couple of days then you plug it in again , and it works for about 10 days
a super picture with this cable ! for the price , you 've got to try this before spending hundreds of dollars on others i give it 2 thumbs up
i purchased my first roadmate in august 2004 since then i have taken it to various places in north america it 's gotten me out of some tight spaces i 've never gotten lost while using it
i have case logic cd wallets from 7 years ago that are still in good shape despite the abuse i put them through i bought this one only because of cd collection expansion i find simply wiping off the outside cover with a wet sponge keeps it clean the nylon covers really hold up over time remember the 128 cd capacity refers to cds without their accompaning booklets it 's really 64 cds with booklets
this charger is designed for every ipod except the shuffle the shuffle connects via usb , this charger uses firewire
i did n't buy this on amazon but wanted to say this device is great the only bad thing was my laptop is old ! ca n't go wrong with this one
our new vcr dvd player is wonderful set up was easy and i am even able to record something that the set up configuration on my last model was unable to do delivery was even faster than expected ! quality is teriffic and price was reasonable
my old dvd would not play some of the many new formats , i e dvd r , etc this unit plays every dvd i 've put in it with no hassles the vcr has an auto tracking adjustment feature that seems to be fool proof , no stutters or static in the sound and the icing on the cake is the remote i understand it ! plus it controls my television functions excellent price and standard excellent amazon service well done
i bought these speakers some time back i was a bit skeptical because the sub woofer looked a little wierd but once i plugged it in they sounded really good
i 've been using sbl soundcards for about 3 years i use it for recording live and with sound fonts this usb device is easy to set up and the sound quality is great ! one installation tip initially after i connected it and installed the software , i was not getting any sound , although the software was installed successfully i rebooted , and everything was detected and has worked fine since so just remember to reboot after installation
i am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys i bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650 's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out i first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome i could hear things in songs i have never heard before i then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp there was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you i am glad i got these instead of the 650 's cause my friend owned the 650 's and if you do n't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck
this little doohickey is exactly what i needed to read my memory sticks load the software , plug it into the usb port and you 're off and running ! the mobilemate is super speedy ! the files pictures pop right up with no lag time and you can read all forms of memory sticks with this one reader
i'm very happy with this model i use it mostly as a vcr replacement to record broadcast tv shows you ca n't beat the price for this feature set i 'll try to describe some aspects that are n't mentioned in the other reviews the owner 's manual can also be found online in pdf format
i purchased the monster cable mp hts 1000 without reading the reviews , \( which i do n't usually do \) for the simple reason of where i purchased my hdtv , samsung hls 5687w they were trying to sell me but for a 150 , which was too much i plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound i have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable that connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop after switching around the cables i had a picture again i ca n't really see an improvement in the picture quality \( hd is beautiful \) i bought the monster basically for the protection
the 50g is the successor to the hp 49g they both accept only a maximum of 1gb securedigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1gb operating system file address space only about 0 9gb of the securedigital flash cards \( a little more on the hp 49g than on the hp 50g \) are accessible the manuals only vaguely state that they recognice fat16 and fat32 securedigital flash cards the hp 50g has a black case with a black metallic faceplate the white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the hp 49g red \( or tomato \) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate the black hp 50g looks tastefully geared for serious users they still have no display backlighting or a color display the hp 50g keyboard feels a little more compliant than the hp 49g but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970 's series of the hp hand held calculators
the convenience of this product is terrific whenever i show people how it snaps in half , they 're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one now that all computers have usb ports , i can put my photos into any computer anytime i want without worrying about the docking station a must have product for every digital camera ! !
great product it 's two in one you have it in your camera and take photos , next you can plug it into the usb port and download data it 's worth the money
first time i heard these i was floored by the output nice high , mid and low bass sounds no matter what you have going thru them be it music , games or movies definately worth the low low price
i am going to strictly comment on the linksys pap2 a lot of the reviews on here have been for the vonage service the linksys pap2 is not the vonage service , but one of many adapters you can use
i read the other reviews and do n't understand where they are coming from unless they are all by at t or bell employees i 've had vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it i have local numbers for seattle , salt lake city , boston and san francisco so my friends can stay in touch these numbers only cost me 4 99 each a month customer service is excellent they stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly this is especially nice after they added 911 service
i'm using monster optical cable as well , but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf
this is the best lock you can find for laptops , but i am still not very confident with it it looks flimpsy but better than others
installation on a normal home network setup is very easy my setup was a little more complex due to voip router , and 2nd wireless router sling has instructions on their web site but i still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work to work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001 once i worked this out everything is great
this is a quality built toner cartridge , but for the money , it should have a great toner capacity
i bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint i use it in chicago a lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal , not true at all i think the longest i have ever waited was 20 seconds it does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes , when i am surrounded by tall buildings \( wacker dr \) but this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna
soundwise the klipsch promedia ultra 5 1s were everything that they were supposed to be the bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted the sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case
it has some very useful addition from the previous model it has cut the time of doing my homework in half
great for frequent air travel to pass the time minor complaints instructions are sparse \( had to get my son to show me how to use itunes load songs \) , but still have n't figured out how to arrange songs on the ipod my problem
this backpack has been such a useful companion for me there are lots of space inside even for huge text books , and compartment is arranged just right to hold variety of stuff cds , dvds , paperback books , pens , cell phones , water bottles , etc , etc there are numerous creative ways of storing stuff indeed my whole life as a student can be inside at once
i had to 'fix' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod i have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes i also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too i also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder
i had n't seen this product in stores as i usually would see the white tunedok which seemed pretty cool but i decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car \( i have a white 40gb 4th generation ipod \)
works better than any other glossy paper i have used with my epson 960
i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her
i have owned many sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now the only problem i have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory , you run out when you need it most that is why i upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the sony 1 gig actually i carry a spare 1 gig too where ever i go
at first , the keyboard looked cheap and the keys were in slightly different places than normal , but after time , i got used to the layout , and found that the keys actually work surprisingly smooth it probably helped my game a bit the extra bit on the front of the board did break off after 2 weeks , but i did n't like using it anyway
i bought this speaker cable because i wanted it to fall in a straight line and hug the walls without curling all over the place this cable does just that i'm very happy with it if that is your goal too , i can recommend this cable
i 've used the itrip by belkin , the tunecastii by belkin , and this monster icarplay for getting my tunes to my car speakers this is the best design and works the best of the three i like that it can charge my ipod and that the transmitter itself is inline the signal seems to be decent enough , though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static this gets more pronounced the louder you make it
works precisely as advertised none of the complaints in previous reviews hold for my experience specifically , battery backup works and sound quality of messages is excellent only negative too many words spoken by the machine and they sometimes seem to overlap
we replaced a tape unit with this one and are so pleased no more waiting for the tape to rewind and this one keeps the messages once played until you remove them also very accurate on time we love it !

bought it for my elderly mother , who is getting hard of hearing the volume control on each handset has helped her a lot she also says that the clarity from the handset is better than anything phone she 's had before the extra large size base unit dial buttons are also very helpful for her
we received our dlp tv stand in record time we had wanted to get it for a new tv that was being delivered that weekend we ordered on i think a tuesday and it was at our office on friday it was in excellent shape and we had no trouble putting it together the tv fit perfectly !
the numbers on the clock are not bright enough to see in the day light i wish they were brighter and bigger
just a note to future readers
this was a very highly rated item on cnet at the price i paid for it at amazon it was like they were giving it away
just spent the weekend photographing and video recording lots of activity and did n't even get close to capacity
2gb of flash memory will not be destroyed at high altitude or dropped short of shattering the memory stick a 30gb hard drive as in the ipod 30g \( that my son has \) is subject to air pressure , shock and temperature domain that a flash memory device will not be subject to because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk , moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if , brought in from a cold car and turned on i do not know about the ipod but some larger devices have dew point detector that will not spin up unless the air in the device is at safe temp
i am pleased at the sound of these speakers i feel that for the price , it was a good purchase the carrying case that is included is a nice addition you can use the included a c adapter or run it on batteries not only do i use these speakers with my ipod , but also for my mac book laptop i do n't need an overbearing sound , but these portable speakers are just right
kit completo para colocar una peque a red inal mbrica casera , sin problemas sencillo de instalar , tanto que cualquier bolsa sin experiencia puede hacerse con este kit tiene se al fuerte , sin atenuaciones
i purchased a sony wega 27 inch tv i took advantage of it 's rear component input labeled video4 i connected my sony dvp360 dvd player with dvd viewing , the movie dinosaur , bug 's life , toy story 1 and 2 , and vegas vacation , the colors were very vibrant , details were dynamic , and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution i have viewed these same movies on larger screen hdtv 's such as the pioneer elite and was disappointed \? \? \? glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture i ca n't imagine that i can do any better for my television than these cables i am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my sony wega with these monster component 3 cables
i had a game that would not even play on the xbox because it was so scratched after using the game dr it works perfectly it is like i bought a brand new game the game dr was pretty easy to use too
this is a fantastic home projector i am a very picky electronics fan this exceeded my expectations the colors are rich , bright great
i have paired this with my linkysys wireless g router and i have not had any problems with either the modem installed without any issues prior to this modem i was using an rca which began having connection problems since the linksys install i have rock solid connection to the internet and a more stable wireless network previously i would expirience intermittant drop outs and would have to reboot currently i couldnt be more satisfied has been a good 3 month
the product was easy to load onto my windows based computer using windows xp i connected everything as instructed and as soon as i plugged in the tv cable to the back of the modem , my internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider
i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but did n't measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies , especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound , i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds
i purchased 2 cards for about us 42 for my psp they work ok i had other sandisk products and dont have any complaints best of all these cards came with the adapter memory stick pro duo to memory stick so i could use it with my videocamera its nice when one company starts addresing the multiple formats problems
i just bought a refurbished roadmate 700 a few days ago it took minutes to locate my current location , which was totally normal
if you go through a lot of aaa batteries , this is one of the best deals on the market , short of investing in a recharging unit and a couple of rechargeable batteries a very good value
a sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop i took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the kensington contour i did n't want to buy a kensington i wanted a backpack making company with a name i knew , like jansport , or kelty i 've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products i settled on the kensington because it had the qualities i was seeking comfort , quality materials and design , water proofing , laptop padding , urban black , rugged exterior , sophisticated appearance , lots of pockets , adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket i write and work in media for a living mostly i work at home , but once a week i travel to cities this pack does exactly what i want it to do have places for everything i need , protect my precious laptop , and look hip
as a journalist , i need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever i went now , with the zen 's microphone recording feature , i'm able to use it to record my interviews , and it 's easier to transcribe because of its clear , crisp recording quality
so far i used one tape of this pack the video quality is pretty good
short review have burned about twenty disks , all work perfectly have made home dvds out of them , all work in three different regular dvd players that i 've tried very satisfied with them
to avoid burning a coaster , update the firm ware on your dual layer compatable drive first \( \) the verbatim discs seem to have fewer compatability problems than the other brands i 've tried
the sandisk cruzer ti is the most durable thumb drive on the market i had a 512mb cruzer ti before this one i dropped it stepped on it and was just not too careful with it through all that it never failed me i needed an upgrade and picked this one , because the 4gb was not available it move data fast and the new u3 stuff is very interesting i am not all that used to the u3 stuff yet , but i am sure i will start to use it to its fullest soon co workers of mine buy the less expensive usb drives and break them the sandisk cruzer ti is the absolute best
i had a small 512 sandisk a while back , so when i saw a review for the titanium 2gb cruzer in a popular computer mag , i decided to upgrade from my lexar 1gb so far , i'm very impressed just did a 1 26gb transfer that took 140 seconds i was a big leery of the included software , but was pleased to see that if i did n't care for it , it was easily removed i have not had an issue with either the software or the drive , and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract this is a very good drive , and contrary to the negative comments , i would encourage anyone looking for a fast , stylish , practical jump drive to seriously conside the titanium cruzer
i am satisfied by the purchase of this targus cvr600 15 4 groove notebook backpack since it is super wide , comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects apart of the laptop i recommend it to you
great buy for a wonderful speaker system works beautifully with my mac mini for great sound would not hesitate to purchase again great contemporary look on my desk so easy to turn the volume up or down either from my screen or the subtle touch control on the creature i highly recommend
i recommend these speakers have had them for 3 months now and they are great sound quality is great
recently bought a analog big screen tv switched from s video to component cables there is a big difference the picture looks more film like with component cables do not hesitate to upgrade stay away from cheap wally world brands you get what you pay for the s video cable i used was monster cable m1000 sv
i got one of these a few years ago it 's been to several countries , on camping trips , bicycle trips , subways , etc etc and held together very well i pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off i go , not lugging around a huge laptop anymore
let me just preface this review by mentioning that i read many customer reviews \( here and elsewhere \) on this product before purchasing it i focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws after using this keyboard for almost 6 months i believe that saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality
upgraded from 19 viewsonic crt this monitor is superb ! recommendation go with native resolution , enable clear type through display settings , and download the monitor drivers from viewsonic \( xp uses standard drivers , not as good as viewsonic 's imo \) , then restart , makes a huge difference over settings out of the box
i love my shure e3c earphones and up until recently was pretty happy with the foam sleeves however , i was constantly having to reset them in my ears when engaged in strenuous activities
it says the keyboard is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to type with i do n't think it is that comfortable it 's a little hard getting used to , so be prepared to hit the backspace a couple of times the keyboard is 100ma and uses usb connection there is a usb to ps 2 converter included overall , it is an ok product for the money , as it is the cheapest usb keyboard i 've found
arrived in time , decent quality for the price is a bit difficult to close though , as the zip is n't awesome but as i said , it 's good for the price
works great , just like ti should , can add more sheets to store more
this is a very good skin for 60 gb 80 gb owners it completely covers the entire ipod without sacrificing functionality what separates this skin from other skins it the visor \( a plastic shield which protects the screen \) my only problem with this skin is the belt clip it is impossible to remove and difficult to use a better belt clip would make this the perfect skin this is a very good price from techgnet
i have this card for a week , and what i can tell you is that this card has a quality that i 've never heard from any sound card the sound is so clean , balanced and accurrate
the belkin cassette adapter was my 2nd attempt at a product that would allow me to play my ipod through car cassette deck the first , non belkin , product \( can you say monster here \? \) was crap stopped working properly after two weeks the belkin adapter has performed flawlessly for 2 months now
i have long struggled to find the perfect remote the urc9910 is n't it , but its pretty good its no match for my harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls i have 2 urc9910s , both programmed identically for my main ht the cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house the kids can be using one urc9910 with the tv ht and i can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the rf part of the second urc9910 remote for the price you ca n't beat it all buttons afik are progammable or mappable setting it us is a pain and i had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my tv to do its thing so that is where it looses a star otherwise its a great performer and with the price , i do n't mind if my kids use it , whereas , they are n't allowed to use my harmony 880
only thing i did not care for was the design on the top of the disk other than that , these are quality dvd
i bought this to replace an epsom printer that refused to print accurate color , and an old canon scanner i am very , very pleased ! it looks terrific \( my daughter said , wow , cool new printer ! \) set up was easy and the printing is fast and absolutely beautiful , even in draft mode better yet , the cartridges are much cheaper than my epson ones scanning is easy and good , too i do n't use fax , so ca n't rate that function
i received the correct q5949x cartridge
if you are like me and dont really care about the best sound quality you can possibly have , and do n't mind the tiny bit of static \( keep in mind i live in a city \) then this is for you its simple , it works , and im glad that i bought it , and that it didnt break the bank i like it
i have a gateway cx2610 , and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes enter this targus lapdesk when folded out , it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours
i got the newer model of these , with the blue light on the speakers all i can say is that these speakers are worth the money you get what you pay for these speakers have pretty good highs in them , bass wise there decent they hit alright , and sub decent you pay more money , you get a better system you know this system here is n't much money , so it is n't going to be the best so there is n't no reason for the bad reviews i think they work really good for the price their tagged at so if your looking for a system with some good highs , and decent bass these are for you
i recently purchased a pny 512 mb secure digital card from best buy when it was on sale for 29 99 each card i had been given a sandisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year , which had gone curropt the pny is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old sandisk i would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with sandisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer
this was part of my stereo update i selected this receiver for quality , value and ease of operation i matched it up with the sony cdpcx355 300 cd player and a fresh pair of those bose 301 v speakers years ago i used to be an audiophile and i now think i'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby
i bought a 32 inch 5 years ago in 2003 when movie i was trying to move it across the room and it flipped face first in the floor mind you i had paid like 200 for sear 's sorry 3 5 year \? warranty and it turned out they would n't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there i heard a sickening crash \( like the picture tube glass breaking \) it still works and only has a dent it the top left i think i got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again not a big deal since i have a directv remote , but i forgot i even had pip because of no remote from now on if i can afford it i will buy sony only i bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that i never use
this tv weighs a ton , took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire i have owned several sony tvs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that i have had with a 27 sony mainly compared this model with the corresponding panasonic tau , absolutely hated the tau remote and am very familiar with the sony note that the remote was not the deciding criteria , but it was a consideration i have no real complaints about this tv , the menu system is nice and the picture very good i do not normally use the built in speakers so really ca n't comment about their sound this tv has a 16 9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus , i tried it once using a dvd as source input and liked the widescreen format that the dvd player provides better than the 16 9 mode the 27 sony that i have has an auto volume feature , this 36 does not and i do miss it i would purchase this unit again note that there is a very similar sony model that has upgraded sound , but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire
these are amazing products for low freq they 'll really get down word of advise do n't use them for higher bass freq sounds more like a grinding noise after about 75 htz enjo
the 4gb high speed memory card is the best it is fast and it can store so much data i cant even imagine using all of the memory but the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's over 700
i bought these here and have had the for a little bit now they work great i will buy more when needed
no problems w the phone there is no mute button and it 's annoying to hit two buttons to mute unmute i also could n't find a way to change ringer volume but it 's easy to change the ringer melody and there is one that 's really soft
i really like this mouse it is easy to use and is one of the most comfortable on my hand i have gone through a lot of mice and have finally found the one for me
this stand works great for bringing the monitor up to eye level if you want to sit comfortably get rid of back and neck strain this targus stand is definately the way to go and the price is right
this monitor stand is worth every penny , and considering the price , that really isnt that many pennies what a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view i have an ibm laptop and i place it on top of the stand with the stand , i probably have to look down at most about 10 15 degrees before the stand , i would have to look down at about 35 degrees this does not seem like much , but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen , your neck will be sore buy this stand and your neck will thank you
the case itself fits very snug around the ipod , and even gives it a better look the only complaint that i have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open , and even falls off at times i still give the case a 4 star rating , because i am a soldier in iraq , and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my ipod clean if a product can keep something clean in iraq , then i am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere
what can i say , it 's a rubber case that stretches over my ipod there 's little room for malfunction white would 've looked better but is n't available through amazon or its merchants without paying more than the product cost for shipping it has little hard clear plastic windows over the screen and dial , the dial covering pops open so far \( several weeks now \) they work fine without scratching
these speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road they are a great look and compact the sound is decent and should not be confused with higher end speakers they serve the purpose for which they were intended as far as i am concerned as i purchased them to play my nano i pod i do recommend them
i agree with most of the reviews here the pc155 is a great headset overall the sound quality is great volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent i 've listened to a great deal of mp3 music through these babies and i am very impressed spacial stereo imaging is great and i 've actually heard things in the songs that i have never heard before ! it actually shows the imperfections of my mp3 and makes me realize that i probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my cds the controls are also simple to use , both on the cord and on the pc
i purchased this headset for use with my mac dg5 and skype internet telephone the combination is killer i cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only , but for me , the quality is far better than what i have with my phone , and it was really as easy as plug and play i wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires i wish that the headset was more sold on the otherhand , i have not had any problems with the equipment up to now and the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller , which is important to me , especially as my hearing starts to deminish i saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone imo , this is too complementary for its price and features , a good buy and good sound quality , but imo , this is not an audiophile headphone
all 3 kids have a tunebase it works great , easy to use it also charges the ipod while we travel
i 've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years they 've included koss the plug , sennheiser px100 , koss ur29 , koss sportapro and a few others all had their strong and weak points so far , this has been the closest i 've had to a good balance
i had been wanting a nice color gps unit for a while my wife purchased this one for me and i love it i purchased the city select maps to use with the autoroute system it would be nice if the maps were included with unit i 've had it out on several caching trips now and it has n't let me down yet make sure you take the time to read through the instruction book so you will know how to use the many features that the unit has built in
this is a overall convient carrying case it does not scratch you ipod in anyway this is a great case for jogging or everyday use , it has a belt clip that works very well great and simple case , i highly recommend it for everyday use
this is a wonderful product the surround effect is phoenomenal and i just love it the extra 50 is worth it for the quality sound that it delivers
i initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the sony srf m37v because of its five one button pre sets which make it a no brainer to use while exercising however , the srf 59 , perhaps because of its analog tuning , suffers less from co channel and adjacent channel interference on fm it 's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin with this in mind , i purchased another srf 59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it i literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed i was having so much fun scanning the fm dial there was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass heavy 12 remixes of eighties new wave hits with , blessfully , very limited commercial interruption over the course of a three hour listening session , i gradually cranked up the volume as i was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds , it became apparent that with bass heavy audio at very loud volumes the srf 59 's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality \( i understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output , therefore there will be no audio clipping \) nevertheless , the sound quality from this bargain priced walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding the party is literally in your head , and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear , which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses i also made one pass through the am band and there the srf 59 was no slouch either i hauled in 1200 woai san antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me though no true dx machine , after all how could it be , it is at the least a competent performer on the am band as well \( i suspect early in the evening am dxing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time \) for more on this model and others visit xin feng 's website i highly recommend this model for cheap thrills !
a good basic am fm radio not digital tuning , but it works fine reasonably good reception
i bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because i trust toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average overall , i am very satisfied with the product we have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained we have n't had any problems with the mechanics of the player we also bought a case \( which i highly recommend \) so that we have enough baby einstein to keep her happy to our destination also , the battery has never run out , and charges quickly my only problem with it is that the volume does n't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner but , my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway , so it was n't that big a deal for us
this dvd player is great for the road , and even at home when you do n't want to be bothered unless the are much loud noises happening around you , the players' speakers work fine it comes with all of the accesories you 'd want , including a car outlet , wall adapter , remote , and the battery it charges in under 4 hours , and plays for over 3 hours
i do not have a hearing problem , but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume this phone fills the bill at least so far ! the only caveat no speakerphone , which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold
this car kit works very well the screen is a bit larger than other dvd players of similar type the only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours \( shorter than many movies \) so , if you are going to use this in the car , you need to be able to charge it
we bought this unit from sam 's club right before a trip to disney world \( 8 hours in the car with a toddler eek ! \) however , it was is perfect ! we still use it for trips around town when we 're in massive traffic or our son is being really fussy the case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work , but we figured out a way to make it work for us also , the remote does n't work well , but we do n't really need to use it as a dvd usually lasts long enough between stops
the cable was a good price , and it fit my printer perfect worth the few pennies i paid
these speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music the only reason i did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn t fofill the height of volume i wished it is pretty loud , but i like really loud i do not own this but one of my friends does i hoe to get logi3 i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews
these speakers are not what i had expected from their size , price , and looks their quality , even at high volumes , exceeds many other speakers i 've seen at double the price tag the reason i bought these was because of the other reviews and the size another reason was the proposed battery life , 35 hours on 4 aaa batteries , not bad at all so far its been very close i have heard the other speaker \( systems \) and yes the jbl onstage and the bose sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations , but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby
i spent a lot of time reviewing toaster ovens to replace our 8 year old delonghi alfredo one most of the others had so so features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them however , with the 5 star review and cuisinart name , i chose the tob 30bc it toasts , it bakes , it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital overall , it 's a great oven and we have no complaints with it 's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit but less than a month later , one of the knobs broke off the unit they are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening my hubby sent an email to cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob , but one would have expected better engineering from a name like cuisinart
when we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations , price was the main consideration the price for these units was well below budget since our main application for them was for audio enhanced cat \( computer assisted training \) , high fidelity and volume were not issues they worked admirably for the purpose
i 've purchased several logitech mice \( cordless optical \) and i 've been satisfied with all of them , except for the battery life i had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month this new logitech mouse is terrific it 's been several months and i have not had to change the batteries yet and i am not even using the on off switch \( i want to test the battery life without the switch first \) battery issues aside , the mouse is smooth , light and accurate it was simple to install and i 'd buy it again in a heartbeat
this stereo works great and its cute and small so it doesnt take up alot of room , it lights up blue when u turn it on in the dark and i love the remote , now i dont have to get up to switch the station
i bought this headset and i must say it 's a great buy first off it 's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams it 's small which definately helps when your wearing it around at times it 's like you do n't even feel liek your wearing anything exactly how a headset should be i 've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires the only problem i have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones but that a small price to pay for such a great , inexpensive headset like this one
i was looking for comfy earphones to replace my phillips one i got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and i stumbled on this one i was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy
i bought these earbuds for the first time 3 years ago for 15 now u can get them for under 10 they last more than six months of hard wear and tear before they need replacing awsome i 've been using them for a long time and do n't plan on changin
lenmar is great to work with , when beach audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment beach audio told me i would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that i had to purchase poor return policy so i just sent it to lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one only took one week to get it go lenmar
i really likethe design on this protector , and bought 3
overall , i like this surge protector and would buy it again i bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets , six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick style transformer plugs i did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration , and this unit always came up it has worked just fine for the month or so i 've owned it i particularly appreciate the angled plug , which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem
my mp830 has performed well in the time that i 've had it my family members have found it easy to use as well i was saddened at the early demise of my epson cx6400 which suffered from a common problem of dried ink clogging the feeder tube i chose the canon after reading good reviews , and i got it for an excellent price right here on amazon plus free shipping it still sells for more at my local office depot and best buy in truth i have n't tried all of it 's claimed capabilities , but i'm happy with what it 's been able to do thus far
i use this in my videography business , primarily for weddings so far i 've never had a problem , and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position
these 2 0 speakers sound great \( and not just for their size \) , are adjustable , small , and good looking i'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when i turned the volume up so i could understand human speech i'm happy i spent the money these are real quality in my opinion
i recently bought an altec lancing headset for 20 and it was the worst headset investment i 've made horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two so i bought this headset and i have been quite pleased with it the mic output is extremely crisp while talking with clients they said that it sounds like i'm talking on the telephone with them or better they are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing all in all a good headset
works good for me some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product
this product is awsome , i intalled it on my car with a sony stereo system , i placed the end of the ilink cable inside of a compartment of my car so i could put my ipod in , the sound quality that the cable delivers its outstanding , besides , it does not look like a cheap cable , it has a thick rubber coating that gives it some stiffness
i 've been using this cf card on my nikon 4300 for a couple of months now it writes fast compared to my other cf \( canon stock , from another camera \) however , start up of the camera takes longer \( because of the size \) , and as more pictures are stored , there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing i 've also used this on a dell axim , and it worked great ! no problem in formatting
i'm still discovering the power of this program at least when teamed with the garmin 60cs auto routing , waypoints , detailed maps , assistance in finding the nearest gas station the list is nearly endless
well , i have used 3 4 cassette adapters , till i heard this one , only words that i can say is you have to hear it to identify the difference
i bought this from amazon for 15 and it works great with my car audio
there are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on target relative to my experience with these headphones but here are my 2 cents
i bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them , and i agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat , uncolored sound with tight , but not boomy , or overpowering bass by the way , i 've owned the sony mdr v600 's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these , but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications , but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion these have been used by musicians , studio engineers , and on air talent for 20 years now
the razor diamondback is awsome no problems with install and great sensetivity when doing everything
although there are more expensive options , if you 're just looking for something to keep your ipod from sliding all over in the car , the isqueez is a great option
this player is very convenient for long trips if you want to save the money , you can get it free from this web site awesomestufffree com portabledv
i'm a section editor at a high school newspaper and i have used this drive every day both in that class and in all my others for over a year and it has never let me down it 's small , sleek and elegant and has a quick transfer rate
awesome product for the price you need to get a small ring \( like from a key fob from a car \) to use it on your own key ring
good sound quality for the sub 150 \( per pair \) price tag easy to install
i ca n't believe the unbelievable prices of flash drives these days i just bought this one from wal mart for 20 00 dollars that 's way cheaper than on amazon com plus i 've noticed that amazon com has switched to third retailers and some do n't even ship to hawaii , or do ship to hawaii at a hefty price this switching of amazon having the lowest price to third retailers is really turning me off possibly even towards purchasing books
small , convenient and classy i love the netgear wi fi phone yes , it is n't perfect , but due to the uplink with skype , they can update the software in the phone i'm hoping they will be able to make the phone more compatible with starbucks and hotel wi fi that would make the phone perfect in the meanwhile , i'm enjoying making phone calls all hours of the day to my friends round the world
it certainly did excellent color qualit
after i read some folk 's horror stories , i was really reluctant to purchase this device well , it took me only 5 minutes to configure the dwl g710 , and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house it was really simple and it worked well with our comcast netgear wireless cable modem
i'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones , but i have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 \( purchased from amazon \) , and i have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers , which were easily replaced when they are wound up in their little yellow case , the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that do n't offer such security
unit performs well , is reasonably fast , and has on board security software that will allow the setting of a password if you choose this option , loading each time upon insertion is a little slower , and you must 'stop' the unit prior to removing it when operating under the password protection the few times i have forgotten i 've not lost any data , but it scolds me for doing so upon the next use
purchased the unit 9 05 because there was n't a tele jack near the t v thus far has worked w o a hitch connected to my direct t v black box to show caller i d on the screen
these cables are super with my new dvd player there is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment the picture is soo clear , and vivid the cables themselves are really made well , they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt if you get these monster cables you wo n't be sorry
i purchased my itrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product the itrip is a good choice over competitors' products and offers a good value for the money radio reception is good i especially like the changing channels feature the fact that it charges the ipod while in use even makes it better the only negative thing that i 've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the ipod slot and i have to push it back that 's mostly due to rattles and i imagine will get worse with time
i bought mine about a week ago and i have n't had any problems with it the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it 's a little hard to plug in take out but other then that i'm 100 pleased with it it 's not cd quality but it 's very close good buy
this review concerns the v3 hardware and firmware v3 0 20 i did not purchase from amazon
the navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on our toyota highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top , but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well the ique was able to hold signels with no problem i think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area
i love the ishuffle it does the job not many features , but makes my 2 hour commute livable
i just thought people should know that you can by the shuffle from apple and have it engraved and shipped for free for 79 00 \( everyday price \) so amazon is not really offering a great deal here
this is the best device i have bought for at least a couple decades i am a degreed engineer , and i love gadgets just the best i have had it about 3 months , and i love it attractive base , all the connections , removable speakers , picture quality is among the best lcd that i have viewed i highly recommend it
the speakers sounds excellent for it 's price but the power button has a defect you need to push it a certain way to power it on
it does n't have spectacular bass power , but i am happy for the product i got at such a feasible pric
pro
i have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year i have been very happy with them , and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup
works great in my cingular 8125 phone i ca n't believe how inexpensive these have become ! more space than i 'll likely every need , and no speed issues \( noting that the 8125 is no speed demon itself i ca n't attest to this product 's performance in something that 's inherently faster \)
i ordered the 2 gb card twice fast shipping and both worked perfectly
this phone has excellent voice quality , including in conference mode the only reasons it does n't get 5 stars from me is that
amazon has a nice price on the jbl duet speakers \( july 2006 36 95 \) dealmac is a site i used and returned to amazon
i bought this laptop stand when i found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so i could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them so now i have the center of the screens at the same height , side by side it is really nice to have twice the screen real estate
one of the least expensive ways out there to raise your computer screen to eye level i am 6'3 , so when i sit i am still pretty high in the air with this stand i am able to sit with great posture and look straight ahead to my screen i would definitely suggest getting one of these if you 've ever thought about raising your monitor up off the desk
i'm overly critical of sound quality at home i have the tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection this doesnt' compare to that but the tritton is 99 too
i love this printer i purchased it to print 8x10s from my digital camera the ink does n't fade over time like my hp did
as you may already know , this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these panasonic models kx tg2700 kx tg2720 , kx tg2730 kx tg2740
i recently bought an hp 17 widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling this case is all that and more on one side is a detachable cell phone case the other side a hidden drink holder it has a pocket that it slides into if not needed that came in handy in the airport
very reasonable price and a must have as a spare for those that leave affixed to windshield year round fast shipping a great shopping experience
i 've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget i 've owned mine for about three years and i love it i use it nightly the application i find this perfect for is audio books stored on mp3 this of one of the only small , portable mp3 players that has it 's own speakers i go to bed listening to audio books and i do n't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around however just slightly larger than a cd walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip , where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines
i have used this 128 mb xd memory card and it works fine the pictures are good i have had no problems i now have this memory card and the standard 16 mb card that came with my camera good deal
review this product over the internet , and it is just what i was looking for my daughter of twelve years of age , pros is portable and rechargable cons the sound is not as good as the boose but with less volume it is quite acceptabl
i had bought one of these five years ago when i was in the states and am still happily using it at home unbelievably durable for a mouse pad heavily used for hours everyday for five full years fed up with giveaway mouse pads sliding with my hand movements , i was searching for something decent to use in the office and amazingly found the exact same item it is a good example that how little things make a big difference
i bought this ipod 4g to replace my 2g one that got stolen and chose more memory as the 2g got filled up too quickly can say that this is probably the best size in terms of memory otherwise , as usual with macs , very easy to use , even for low tech people like myself , beautiful design , small and light , not too fragile , just great on the go
just what i expected good quality , convenient and holds lots of musi
i researched cases upon receipt of my 20 gb ipod and deemed this the best this case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear , hard shell the hard case protects the ipod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs it also does not obscure the screen an enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit
it 's great if you have high speed enabled devices it 's very fast a 2gb is sufficient for almost purpose
i 've had this controller for over a year now , and it still works great and reliably as ever after many months , the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little , but a quick jiggle and they 'd be back to center
first , i should say that i'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is the display card at compusa said this monitor has a 1000 1 contrast ratio , and i'm not sure what that means , but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture the contrast ratio is higher than most other flat panels i looked at , which have a contrast ratio of around 500 1 to 700 1 \( including samsung 's own 20 1 non widescreen model \) everything is crystal clear , which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies it is also good for gaming half life 2 and unreal tournament 2004 , for example , both look great
cons
it 's a nice look , but it tips over very easily it is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows my advice is if you need a cd rack that holds a lot of cd 's \? save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy
i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective , and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price , but since the player does n't work , it 's essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point
i knew these were inexpensive cd cases , but i ca n't even open one without it breaking into two pieces
i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups , and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software , so i got new software guess what \? my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed , too it 's not my burner \( as another reviewer suggested , implying that people should learn to read \) , as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well , i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs , i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex , usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case , i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products
the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i'm using the plextor dvd burner \( love it ! ! \) , but i'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me , but more the time wasted on burning coasters
i hope it 's live because if it 's memorex , it 's crap ! that 's my latest opinion after using this product i have a liteon sohw 802s and it hates memorex i rarely get a decent burn more often than not i 'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it my movies will skip , stutter , or stop all together so disappointing ! unfortunately i found out too late that memorex uses cmc media , which only has a 0 50 success rate !
while i read the reviews on this machine , it is clear to me that lexar has some serious quality control problems for some people it worked , for others it was a miserable failure i am in the latter group sigh
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true and sure enough they rejected my upcs \( i kept copies \) only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional
please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date , i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only , it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork , yet they state , all required products were not submitted meanwhile , i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint
no free lunch you get what you pay for is that the verdict on this product \?
i have a collection of over 1500 disks so i have bought many cd dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that i have purchased i would avoid this brand
bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that , everytime i on the camera , it wanted me to reformat the card , wth is that \?
i purchased this game pad due to good reviews
i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks
i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about , it must be your computer did not fly either , my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead 's movie factory 3 , some of the software it came bundled with , but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz \( their program \) duh ! ! ! guess what , it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads 's product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! p s since ads does n't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i do n't think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is it was packed well
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera \( but the fuji and sandisk product did
just purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range my original novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room i am attempting to return these currently
i bought four of these and returned them immediately two were dead out of the box a third had horrible sound
when i purchased these batteries , i was very pleased , but that wore off after a couple of months i do n't use my camera all that often , but when i do , i expect ther batteries to have some charge i recharge them per instructions , and they do not hold a charge any longer i know monster makes good products , but i am a little disappointed in this one
i got this from jnr this unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it i tried this on multiple computers may be this was just a lemon i will exchange it to a better brand
this bookstand , despite the description , is not suitable for heavy books if you put heavy books on this , the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off
its made of flimsy plastic , and all the parts snap on i'm afraid to put a heavy book on there , because i'm sure the parts will just snap off
in the ten minutes since i 've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off more importantly , it ca n't handle large manuals as advertised \( the reason i purchased this particular book holder \) my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages if you do n't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on , keep an eye on the page retainers \( these are the parts that fell off \) and you should be ok as for me , i'm off to read amazon 's return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds the sound quality was good , but the dependability of this item is questionable
i purchased this memory card for a camera i was also purchasing it was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page when i received the card first and then the camera , i was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit because i had opened the plastic package to the card , i was unable to return it in fact , when i emailed the company who sent it , i never even received a response
i am the type of person that always buys the extra warranty on whatever i purchase however , i started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still had n't received their refund check i was astonished i contacted n e w myself and asked them about this with no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps , i was informed that if i did everything by email , it would take at least 15 business days \( that 's three weeks ! \) to receive my refund check after i sent them the warrantied item if i had them send me a pre paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer , it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item in other words , it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! i cancelled the contract immediately it is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract i would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as grado , sennheiser or koss but stay away from these people that 's my feeling and my advice
don't buy this product there , simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly , apple support told me sorry , tough luck i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong !
about three years ago , maybe four , i bought two lexar cfii cards one never worked , the other worked , but lost all data i wrote to lexar , that i had two bad cards , they sent me one new card of the same size i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing i still have my card , in a ziplock none of the file removal programs will get the images off , i 've used all of them , had their \( file removal \) tech help give up
most people buy a ups , plug it in and never test it to make sure it works i tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage i set it to shutdown windows after 1 minute only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it
if you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet , your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage \( even though the modem was n't hurt \? \)
i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives in writing dvds i get verification errors this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus , but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire
also import a cd , money down the drai
the drive arrived at the end of december , was quick to get up and running , and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw and i 've been unable to get the tray to release
i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data
got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff i give it 100 good thing i could return it
i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd , the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably , although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer
the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine , and it is a reassuring led gold , but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for 3 4 days , then erased about 100 photos , all of them irreplaceable cheap yes , but cheap junk
great looking keyboard unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed that includes cleaning and do n't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it the keyboard self destructs after you have the , count them , 10s and 10s of screws
i ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here big mistake upon setting everything up , it all worked great for about two hours then the dreaded unplug protect screen came up now it wo n't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode \( and no , it 's not a short in the wires or overheating it protects even when stone cold , and with no speakers plugged in \) i called sony and they say it is a short in the box so now my two options are to unhook everything , repack exactly the way it came to me and reship back to the online store i bought it from \( with enormous hastle and expense \) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center \( which happens to be across town , and only open monday friday , 9 5pm so much for being convenient \) this thing is brand new and already needs repairs ! !
why would you want this item \? amazon is charging 50 more on this item than the 2nd generation shuffle ! and , according to what i have read , this shuffle is n't very derable it does n't even last a year ! i do n't know about you , but i'll get a 2nd generation shuffle
one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death the contents of the file space were un recoverable and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it
my shuffle suffered the blinking green orange lights so i took it into the apple store a salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he could n't do anything , and said i would have to sign up for a appointment at the genius bar at that appointment , the genius said he could n't fix it , and because he said he did n't know anything about engineering he could n't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both apparently being an apple genius does n't involve understanding how things work , though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut the 'genius then offered a 10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle but could n't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing
the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy
i'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives i have used couple of sandisk flash drives \( i e 512mb mini , 256mb mini \) before i bought this product
these disks would not work with my sony brand dvd writer i have tried several other brands and so far everything works but memorex
to back up my personal dvd collection i burned 200 discs 100 on these memorex dvd r 's , 100 on philips dvd r 's every memorex had flaws during playback every philips was flawless i 've been buying memorex for years but i 'll never buy memorex again
overall the recorder worked ok a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons
here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june 17 , 2006
i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months there is a reason the warranty is only 90 days the performance \( sound quality \) steadily declines over time the ihome worked great when it was new , but it wo n't play songs from the ipod anymore , and the radio is a static box
so when i first got the ihome for christmas , i loved it well , i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light , that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however , after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that wo n't even pick up radio stations so , the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless
we have had ours for almost a year it still works great , but there is one big problem the display is a white violet bright light great for visibility of the clock when you need it , but unfortunately , even when it 's on the lowest setting , it lights up our whole room ! my husband sleeps through it fine , but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio
i like the features i'm satisfied with the sound the user interface could be more intuitive
i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed , but instead , this thing has killed my computer for the second time in 4 days , emitting an un stoppable \( i e , can't turn the feature off \) shriek alarm how do smart , talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear piercing shriek alarm that ca n't be defeated silenced \?
let 's be honest
i have been charged however i did not get a copy of the policy to date
i bought this item like 2 months ago , and now it 's broken i'm sooo frustrated
this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental , and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement
this is a good product sounds great , gets good battery life , everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy , and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use , the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down , and sometimes the sound cuts out all together
this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and , in my case , routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)
with a full charge it does not last more than 10min , could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera canon pro1 the original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge initially i thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all i 'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too
i am disappointed in this product
one out of every 4 discs would fail on me when i 'd burn to this media at 4x slowing down the burn to 2x did n't help either ! i own a sony dru500a with the latest firmware memorex is n't on their compatibility list lesson learned check the compatibility list before buying
i 've got a lite on dvdrw sohw 1673s burner \( revision js02 \) in my fast g4 mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium 7 although my burner is nominally 16x capable , it only burns at about 6x in my setup , probably due to the slow \( ata 33 \) bus it 's on
i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i e mailed tiger com and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
this model was intended as a replacement for my not very old and yet quite functional panasonic pm series stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages , perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd i ca n't comment on other ups brands such as belkin , but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i do n't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures i'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups
while the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice \( feels grippy but not sticky if you know what i mean \) , some of the features are just wrong for instance , the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off also , for whatever reason , the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use \( the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out \)
i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack they are rated at 2000 mah , but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames my 2 year old panasonic 1600 mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots i tried these batteries in my mp3 player and even there , it wo n't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback it is not that the battery does not hold any charge that it has but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight \( a bit dimly \) for hours \( yeah i tested it \) for the test , i had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration \( it is not a charger issue \)
this product is not for the heavy handed
this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet
the tomtom has great features but i returned mine first , the maps are very dated this makes it iffy at best it has terrific potential , if it worked you can use a pda stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip it 's amazing but i wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it 's internal maps and waypoints but i tried a local test first i used roads as waypoints , main roads this way i can force the tomtom to use my routes i did not like it 's choices , since it is a dated map database i set up a local route , and started to follow it it took me to the first road waypoint no problem but it would not go past the first waypoint i would go down the road \( first waypoint \) then it would tell me to take a u turn ! i did then it said take another u turn it had me going in circles perhaps it 's not made to use roads as waypoints , but all indications it gave were that it would the manual was no help support was no help so it went back i have ordered a garmin i2 hope this is ok i have taken the same trip from se fl usa to sc usa with a garmin c330 the garmin has maps that you cannot update , but got me to my destination no problem
i have so for used inav iguidance , mapopolis , navigon navigator 5 and the blue logger street atlas usa out of all these the blue logger street atlas usa is the worst and inav iguidance 2 1 1 is the best blue logger gps hardware is good but v impractical to use bcuz of its strange onoff button
this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons
i have owned this little hub for at least a year i have an older pc which came without usb , so i added a pci adapter i soon realized that i needed more ports , and more convenience , than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floor
this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express
install went smooth on my w2k dell inspiron notebook everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere this thing is junk i'm sending it back
from looking at the d link website and talking to five tech support staff , it appears that there are countless versions of this card , each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support , i finally found the 8 mb driver file i was supposed to download however , they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp 2
i would like to believe that this hub works well but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer , ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions , or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info \( 5 volt , 2 1 amp , center positive \) i 've been to two radio shacks and online they do n't carry it i'm upset any advice
i have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that i did
we have been unsuccessful with this e reader attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money
i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that does n't allow for more photos after only using 40mb i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it does n't allow it to be formatted bad investment ! ! ! would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange
the second disc in this package was faulty , which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd r not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best
replaced first spindle and still junk will always stick with verbatim from now on
i bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site i was very pleased with the purchase then i did n't have one problem with the discs
was a little hard putting it together you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart i am not happy with this product
i have the older , larger version of this product however , it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great , but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this , make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint
they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex , shame on you
after serveral months of use , card error was shown on my canon digital rebel for my 512mb viking card , which was half full with pictures fortunately , i just lost a few of pictures i tried to format the file card error kept occuring on my rebel this 512mb viking card is now used for my data files
i purchased this and am not impressed note that works with all click wheel ipods is n't true it does not work with photo ipods \( at least the 60 gb model \) i'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit i'm ordering a 'photo dock' since i ca n't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60gb photo model
heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs , and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring , i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) , from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is , but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?
the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail in rebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode , sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode \?
i purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight my husband and i both used them , and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes they were great at first , but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears the inside of my ears were so sore i could n't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out , that 's how bad my ears hurt i had the foam pad over them too , and it made no difference i would not recommend these
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy , the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one , but i would n't take that chance again
in each pack there have been several dvd 's that are n't any good too many bad discs in my opinio
i bought the ads upconverter because i bought a hdtv only to find out that my cable co did n't offer hdtv and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtv \( too many trees around my house \) i was n't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing hdtv picture , but for 550 i was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable when i first turned in on i asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought she looked at the tv and said okay i'm ready turn it on i said it is on ! ! quot this is pretty much the reaction i had also when i looked at it the image i got for my digital cable was certianly different , but that 's all it was , different it was not noticably better in fact , in some instances i though the picture was worse i called ads tech support and they kept insisting i try it with my dvd because that is what the product is best for \( even though that 's not what i got it for \) so i did and to be honest i really preferred the picture i got directly from my dvd over the picture i got after running it thru the upconverter it did n't matter what display format i put it in it just did n't do anything to improve the picture save your money if you ca n't get hdtv do n't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
i was impressed with the charger for about 1 month than it stopped charging the nimh batteries it came with i took it back to best buy only to find that all of the rapid chargers on thier shelf did not work either a sales person and i tested them all , hoping i would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked
i did not read the prior reviews , i bought this item loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from target com the mfg software disc contains two viruses one in quicktime the other in totally hip files target has been notified that the software is corupt with viruses that the mfg has gone out of business this item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no web site access or tech support available for this item
i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught 2 viruses on the install cd
i purchased this item and was excited to get them , but burning my first dvds they 're all coasters ! arg pass memorex and go for a more expensive media , like verbatim
as far as i can tell this thing does n't work at all i have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them i should have just replaced the cds
how do i assign a rating \? as several other people have experienced , my unit is also doa i received it , plugged it in , pressed 'clean' , and the motor started up i popped open the cover , put in the disc i wanted cleaned , and pressed 'clean' again nothing terrible quality control
it did n't work properly from the time it came out of the box the carousel would n't make a complete rotation , so cds and dvds would get 'trapped' inside the unit and occasionally , it would simply refuse to play a dvd altogether panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop , so maybe they can get it to function as it should if you do purchase one , please read the warranty carefully a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones , under any circumstances
bad disc error possible fix
hi ! i bought my cyberhome 300 in april 2006 , and was able to set the region code to 0 to watch all dvd 's
this item worked for a while , but required fiddling \( unplugging and replugging repeatedly \) with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually , however , it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets do n't waste your money on this piece of crap
the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded
this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite a60 laptop it cycled on and off every 3 seconds it powered a 100 watt lamp okay , but would n't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min , and is rated at 140 watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at 2a input at 100 240 vac , and if it drew 2a constantly i agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts , which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however , even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1 2 min , but only manages 3 sec in addition , i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2 0 amps continuously i talked to linksys support , and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund , so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts , but i would n't recommend it for more than that
i did n't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning the cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned \( 30 minutes \) it did n't
when i first started using this , i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact , i bought a second one for my wife then , after about two weeks , it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck , which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby 's support on the web , but they were unresponsive luckily , amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many returns
when this adapter first arrived , i thought it was great the sound quality was excellent , and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter style adapter \( there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area \) the first day , i used it for about 20 minutes total \( did n't have far to drive \) , and it worked great the second day i had a bit farther to drive after about 30 minutes , it quit has n't worked again since
this dvd player does play all types of dvds no matter how you burn it but like other reviews , it stopped working after 3 6 months in my case , it was 3 months it just does n't turn on anymore i unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead i do n't watch dvds much , so it 's not like i overused it go with another model this one has problems i thought mines would be the exception , but i guess not and now i ca n't return it because it 's been over 30 days
the panasonic cd player has a good sound quality , but does not automatically change from one cd to the next it requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one cd to another this feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications , and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five cd 's
i 've had the x2 for roughly 14 months the x2 was used for watching movies \( about once every 2 weeks \) and big sports event \( ncaa nfl finals etc \) the unit worked up to about 1200 hrs , then the lamp blew i was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out
i had this card for more than 6 months , and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 transfers went well too then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago my sd usb converter could n't find the card either i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good what a joke
i found that these dvd rs did not work well in my system , were unreliable and slow i cannot recommend them
i have tried these dvdrs with the burner i bought from amazon and they do not work , i will try them again and send an email to you i bought a few imation to try in the burner to ensure it wasnt faulty and they worked ! ! ! what is up with these dvds \?
i plugged my nano into this charger for about 10 minutes and picked it up to check it out it almost burnt my hand my nano is now toast ! i hope it just toasted the battery and not the whole device
i liked this when i first got it very cheap , handy to travel with or leave at work , etc after a couple months , it died completely the little power light would n't even come on i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that does n't work
i purchased this wireless card based on the price , figuring that even if it did n't live up to the good reviews here , i would only be out 20 the set up was easy and smooth , but the card wo n't stay connected to my wireless network i 've got a belkin wireless router the trendnet signal meter generally shows 95 signal strength , but the connection only lasts for a few minutes , and i have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access very annoying i know there 's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop 's connection is stable i purchased a d link card , and it has worked flawlessly unfortunately , i threw away the packaging when the trendnet card arrived if i had n't , then this card would be on its way back to amazon now like the title of my review says you get what you pay for
i have many linksys devices and this is by far the worst one i love linksys stuff , which is why eveything that i own involving networking is linksis but this thing is a piece of crap and now i cant recover the 60 gigs of personal pictures that were on my hardrive because of this things format spend a little more money and get a dedicated network attached storage hard drive
my company supplies these cordless headsets to its employees so i have alot of experience using headsets this is the latest upgrade and it is the worst unit i have ever used it works great for about 3 or 4 months on average after that , the voice unit stops working i can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me i have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted 5 months one broke after 2 months other colleagues have complained about the same thing happening with their units after the experiences i have had with this piece of junk , i would never buy anything from plantronics with my own money avoid this rubbish
i'm a cartoonist i need to be able to print color images for clients i bought this printer two years ago from staples , for 2500 ! worked great for a couple months , after which the toner cartridges started leaking and the print quality rapidly dimished
we 've had this printer at my office for about 2 1 2 years it 's a giant waste of money magenta cartridges spew toner everywhere cyan cartridges streak it 's even worse when you use the manual feed hp has no answers because they deny all the issues hp 's support is lackluster at best anyway the first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them stay away from this printer at all costs if you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight this is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs i expect more from a product with the hp brand stamped on the box to bad you ca n't give 0 stars
obviously hp has a design flaw on the magenta cartridges i have also experienced leakage from only the magenta \( why only this one \?
powder from the toner cartridges get all over the inside of the printer and then ruins every page that is printed every page that is printed from my printer has a greyish color due to the powder dirt inside it is impossible to clean it since the powder is everywhere the only way to get it clean would be to bring it to a car wash \( obviously this would leave the printer with bigger problems than page color \) what a waste of money ! ! ! good thing my office bought it and not me or i would be furious
we travel quite a bit , both business and pleasure , domestic and international so the idea of a pocket wireless router was a god send we bought this one at the beginning of our annual leave \( aka tour the us in a month \) we 'd heard good things about the d link but with the rebates , this one was practically free there was a reason it 's always on sale
i hoping to use the wgr101 to provide wireless , encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel it worked fine in single user , no encryption mode but that is not what i needed i experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with wep or in multi user mode with and without wep one or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection , sometimes i had to reboot the laptops , sometimes i had to reboot the wgr101 , and sometimes i had to reboot the laptops and the wgr101 stay away from this product unless single user , unencrypted access is what you need
my sangean dt200v pocket radio failed after 2 5 years of infrequent use i kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes it worked perfectly on the few occasions when i used it over the 2 5 year period , until yesterday the buttons , switches , and display still work perfectly , but only very faint white noise can be heard , whether via speaker or via earphone the volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control the batteries are new , and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries

this has to be the worst keyboard i 've purchased it 's my first wireless i 've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this
though i like the keyboard , i 've found two serious problems with the mouse first , it is very sensitive to movement i 've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control finally and more importantly , the mouse burns a set of aa batteries about every 8 days i only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so i should be getting a lot more battery life i 've bought other logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case i wish i had bought another brand
note to everyone who is having problems with this card i reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now ! !
the first card i received was defective even after formatting it in a camera , the image files could not be transferred to any of 3 computers with 2 different o ses via usb cable to the camera or card reader i'm waiting on a replacement hope it works

i purchased this device to add to my wireless network , which uses a belkin wireless router i had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router after configuring it , i could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router i made three attempts at customer service my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes , the second call was working with a woman in india , who 's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent i had to end that session because we could n't hear each other i then used online chat , and after 90 minutes i still had not solved my problem , and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons the lady from india did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem , and now i believe her
don't buy it ! i bought a koss dvd player and it broke in 6 months i was told i was out of luck because the warranty is only 90 days they do not do repairs my only option is to buy a new one and was n't even offered a discounted price for it i have seen several complaints like mine about koss on the web they make junk and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks oh , by the way i loved it until it broke
i recently purchased a refurbished toshiba gigabeat f40 for about 150 quite a bargain for a 40 gig mp3 player however , upon reflection , i regret the purchase
even the slightest bump cause the casette to pop out and stop the cd i will be returning this to amazon for a refund
the picture shows the cassette feature along with the car kit the cassette did not come with the kit very disappointed
i purchased this to have a stereo for my ipod for primary use in my office , but to take with me other places i have the 30 gig video ipod it fits loosly the entire system seems cheaply made as i mentioned , i wanted to use it in my office well , at the lowest volume control , it is not very quite , so i would annoy my co workers if i turned it on bottom line save your money ! !
i replaced a siemens 8825 with the motorola 7081 and was , unfortunately , really disappointed the 8825 while rich in function , is quite lacking in quality so what 's good about the 7081 is

after using rca and creative \( both suck \) , i decided to try an ipod this one since only a moron watches video on a 3 4 inch screen
when i put this device in my mp3 player , i espect listen the music but i need a room completly silent and obviusly that no was my intention
i was using this power cord in conjunction w the belkin fm transmitter during a recent 4 hour car ride when i unplugged the ipod , it was incredibly hot , and now it does not work \( i get the folder w the exclamation point on the display \) i tried to restore the ipod , but it is toast
i was extremely excited when i received this product and have had good success with samsung products however , when i made all the connections , the unit did n't work i was disapointed and frustrated all the connections and settings were correct , but it did n't work i have an older dvi connection instead of the newer hdmi digital connection
this player worked for 2 months then all of sudden it started failing with no disk message please do not go for cheap players
i 've had it for one week only and i'm using 3rd pair of duracell batteries right now ! i was using it for 3 4 hours per day \( i have another mouse at work \) stayed switched off for the rest of the day in order to save batteries nice mouse when it works mine is piece of junk , maybe the latest batch they 've got was not up to standard so i totally agree with mr loftin and it 's silver one in my case , not a black one i 've ordered
i can use it for about 5 working days and ka put ! \( even though i switch it off when i'm not using it \) there is no intelligible low battery indication or warning either also when i changed batteries , the battery contacts fell out poor quality
i wanted an original apple usb cord for my ipod , and the description said this is , but it is n't so if you 're like me and you want the original , do n't buy this one
this product is not very good there is no display on the tv , just a black screen the remote , which is just a pause button anyways with no menu functions , does not make a difference because you are unable to see your small ipod screen from far away the overall video quality is quite low , even with an s video cable
avoid this product at all costs ! ! ! i should 've listened to the other reviews but noooo , i just had to see it for myself this product worked \( barely \) for 2 weeks then just totally died in the short time that it worked , the sound quality was just horrible no matter what free channel you play it on i have a good 40 mile drive one way \( not city or metropolitan driving \) and in that span , i 'll have to switch channels between 3 to 5 times
not at all durable due to very , very cheap construction i had to massage my batteries to get the speakers to play a total waste of time to purchase , try to use and return could n't even give these away
i have a voip setup with voicepulse this phone works great as long as i do n't assign phone numbers to the presets when i do it stops ringing after a few days the lights flash indicating an incoming call and i can answer the phone if i notice the lights flashing but it does n't ring if i reset the phone to defaults , erasing all presets , then it works ok i got a new one from at t and it does the same thing i love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset let me know if you know a workaround
callers can barely hear me , even with the mic right in my mouth \( volume adjustment on cord doesnt affect it \)
this item is not described correctly this item is not for garmin c550 or any of the c line i had to returned it at my own expense amazon please correct the description of the item
on the back of the package it says
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
if you have problems with your flash drive \( like i did \) do n't count on any technical support lines are all automated and wait is always over 20 minutes for live support not to mention that it disconects you when it is done telling you this pny tech support is a joke
i'm mad i bought this one to replace my old one this one and the other one are doing the samething i had a chat with an hp service helper and they determined that it was broke their customer service is top notch thought ! they are sending me a new one for free and apearently i get to keep the ink cartidges for free because of my troubles
i like the dish networks technology and the potential that it could be one dvr which covers two rooms is great the picture is clear when it works the menus programming are intuitive the pricing is reasonable
this product stopped working a few days after purchase 5 phone calls and 2 emails were not returned by sandisk this product did not work as advertised and no technical support of any kind is available i would not buy this brand again
the voice recorder meets all my expectations and more
all ports began running slow after just 6 months of use followed linksys rma process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake i followed yet another linksys rma process and had to wait two months for the replacement switch covering their mistake the replacement switch died after 1 week of use the latest rma unit ran excessively hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up this is what i have learned about linksys 1 \) this should be a simple network pass through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly linksys apparently cannot make a good one 2 \) do not even think about turning a broken unit into linksys under their rma process , they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted if these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place 3 \) choose a competitors product i have had other brand switches running for years with no issues
purchased this for my laptop \( it was supposed to match the rangemax modem \) the adapter was not being recognized by my machine , and i contacted customer service the customer service rep was obviously from india \( suprize ! \) unfortunately my inquiry was not resolved and i returned the product back probably would explore other brands next time around
i do n't like it because it is always saying low power and i do every thing it said to trouble shoot the problem with out and luck fixing the problem
i just purchased this mouse it has a good feel it does not scroll as smoothly as i would like contrary to what microsoft says , the buttons are not programmable you have to select from a predefined list i chose to use the small silver buttons on the side as copy and paste neither one works another irritation , i am already getting a popup that says the signal is weak about 18 away , yet the menu says it is fine i got a great buy on it at officedepot \( half price \) , otherwise i would return it
interference from other electronics is a severe problem i had to return this item for a refund if you can locate it several feet from any other electronics , it might work for you , but who wants a phone that you cannot place on your desktop , near a computer
i am a long time pc user and pc gamer
the only reason i bought this unit when i saw it in the store was for the ipod controller feature i really looked forward to being able to control my ipod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight boy was i disappointed ! the ipod adpater works and all but barely it takes forever to scroll through the songs , artists or albums why the hell would alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the ipod so you ca n't even select songs from the ipod itself \? i have over 3000 songs on my ipod by the time i scroll to the song i want i 've already reached my destination and that 's if i even find the song at all ! so now what i have to do is unplug my ipod , scroll to the song i want , then plug it back in \( luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your ipod in \) but again that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck bottom line , the ipod control feature flat sucks the deck features a quick search function but it is uselss it is n't used to search through artsts or albums only individual songs and there 's no way to skip 10 , 20 , 30 or 100 songs at a time only 1 by 1 what 's quick about that \? i have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and alpine thinks i'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1 \? \? \? \? another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the ipod is playing , the display just says song up or song down instead of just showing the name of the damn song ! who thought of that \? what possible help could song up be to anyone \? just show the name of the song while i'm skipping through that makes more sense right \? there are a bunch of other problems i have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the ipod adapter and ipod but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing but then again who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to
i bought an alpine 9847 and the ipod interface i works but it totally hijacks your ipod the beautiful intuitve , fast controls on the ipod itself are locked out and you can only control the ipod from the car stereo it is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you ipod it is very slow , not at all intuitive even after getting used to it it is no good the info on artist , album or song title imports from the ipod very slowly turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever very annoying , very slow , very cumbersome if only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the ipod itself a better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in , either stereo mini plug or rca jacks the just connect directly and use the ipods own controls which are infinitely better i replace an old stereo to get the ipod option and am very sorry i did so
the only thing this item is good for is charging your ipod the transmitter is so weak all you hear is static buzz with muffled music in the background do n't waste your money and , do n't expect any help from the manufacturer who refuses to answer emails or accept a warranty return
terrible design did not fit my car 's electical outlet , it does not work with my jeep liberty the jack construction is defective does not even power on
mine worked pretty well for about the first 50 labels that i made then the font size got stuck ridiculously small so that the message only covers about 10 percent of the tape surface if you want really small labels with a hard to read font size , you could use my pt 1750 to print them out and then cut down with scissors to eliminate all of the wasted label area
i just purchased this product in the instruction manual , it states that only the brother ac adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty why is it that only a brother adapter can be used when ac adapters are supposed to be standard \? a tactic to increase sales \? the adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars in addition , i agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off the 2 line printing does look very nice i have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those
do n't even accept it as a freebie \( as i did \) unless you are prepared to pay 1 15 per sheet for color ink that was my experience with the first color cartridge , which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets , 12 of which were heavy color , the others being mixed color and text or very light color at 17 99 per color cartridge and 14 99 for black i calculate the outrageous , obscene 1 15 per sheet figure for ink this is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old hp720c , which unfortunately does not work with my new hp pavilion pc \( no printer port on this model , among other issues \) i have vowed to not purchase any hp product in the future if i can possibly avoid it i just ordered a canon pixima to replace this ink hog on the positive side , the print quality is good , speed is excellent , and color fidelity is fair the software installed without incident , and the machine is easy to operate , but the hp software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something worse than daytime television
bought this all in one printer and the install disc was bad prints test page every time i turn it on wo n't print jobs get stuck and cannot cancel spoke with customer service for 1 5 hours ! yes , that long they would not refund me and told me that i should have did a better job researching their products they got that right all i could get was a refurbished replacement that also performs like crap hp has lost a customer forever , and i am making it my mission to share with everyone how terrible they are with products and customer service canon , meet your next customer
this bracket will not fit the etrex vista cx this is because the battery cover supplied with the bracket \( replaces the original battery cover to provide attachement lugs \) will not clear the microsd card socket this is very frustrating because the garmin website even shows this bracket , part number 010 10361 00 , in the etrex vista cx accessories list so if you have a cx , do n't purchase this item
the first few times it worked great , after that i have n't been able to use it , for some reason incoming audio is good but the mic does not work , i have to use my computer 's which is anoying so i stopped using altogether waste of money
we have bought 3 of these vtech phones for our house since the begining we have had battery problems it is really annoying when you have to make a phone call and your phone does n't work because of the battery
it 's not often i find a product that 's as disappointing as this the interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain moving around the house and outside of the house , standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle , etc , are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation
i picked up this headset telephone because i am spending more and more time on the phone
i had this for approximately 2 years it worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances one day i left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour during this period , the alarm was activated and i was embarrased to face my office workers this is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm i sent it back to targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm but after several months , it started the same problem
i bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good macintosh support unfortunately the player does not work well with the macintosh the included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import dss files the software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window the use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from windows 3 1 the ds 2 appears to the finder as a standard usb disk and i have been able to copy the dss files from the player to the compuer using the finder it is then possible to play the dss files by double clicking them , but it will only play one file if you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the dss player and relanch it exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as aiff is also nearly impossible there is an export function in the menu , when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears unfortunately there is no other macintosh software available to read or convert dss files as olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the macintosh search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the dss files such as playing the entire file and re recording it with another program
great sound , but the build quality is just not there on a recent trip to europe , the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver they are only two months old and i always keep them in the case ! i had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together since then i 've also had to superglue the right bud as well also , the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead , revealing the fine speaker wire underneath i do n't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad they are great sounding and comfortable , but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners be warned
these headphones are so expensive and they are aweful ! i dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other its very annoying ! i tried to loosen it and the wire was showing , what a piece of s its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when i listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily they are too expensive for a piece of junk ! the only reason i rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones instead purchase the sony srf hm01v s2 sports walkman street style headphone radio i purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better \)
i so wanted to love this thing i have an ipod that i am seldom without , and my car is n't ipod compatible i bought a monster wireless fm transmitter charger so i could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion unfortunately , the thing just did n't work for me
if all you want is a carrying case that is transparent and unable to use the stylus with the case closed , then this is the perfect item for you \( sarcasm \)
i bought this even with the bad reviews i have one of it 's predecessors , a black one and it worked fantastically for 5 or 6 years it still does but the on off button finally died i figured how bad could it be \? the one i have worked great until now
product is light duty , over time it will not hold up to being flipped and opened often , if longevity is your goal purchase elsewher
from the photos and specs i thought this was the camera to have \( both my wife and i loved the look of the camera from the photos we had seen \) there 's always exceptions to rules , and the rule , the more you pay , the more you get is the exception to the rule for this web camera after getting it , i had difficulty in getting the software to load but eventually had success i was very disappointed in the video quality there seemed to be a lot of noise in the picture , and tweaking gave no improvement i returned it to amazon and took a lose in the return shipping cost , but considered it worth it just to get the price of the camera back amazon lived up to their part and refunded the price paid \( less return shipment \) with no hassle
this webcam is not compatible with acer ferrari , with windows xp i do n't know why i just returned it
if you got a crappy brand tv like the samsung the east meadow guy got , you might need a super expensive cable like this to make the image quality acceptable , but if you have a namebrand tv like sony or sharp or philips or toshiba or panasonic , a 15 hdmi dvi cable totally suffices this monster cable is no better than the 15 guy \( also available on amazon , just search for hdmi dvi cable \) do n't waste your money
i have a canon s2 and these batteries last almost as long as the cheap costco non rechargable ones they do take upto 8 hours to charge and amazon is correct about that does anyone know of good long lasting 2500 mah rechargable batteries \?
i hate dese kind of phones day have em at mi skool n da r turrble they hav ok sound but day feel turrble lik puttin too much pressure on ur ears they f king hurt dog don't get dese , get sony h ear dose r alwayz da best
these seemed like good headphones at first but problems with portablity were huge ! the sound was good but 3 months into ownership one earpeice died so the phones are useless ! ! not worth spending time and money on these phones
not a particularly easy lock to use \( combo part rotates freely when not in computer , making it difficult to set the combo \) also changing combo is very easy to do accidently however this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo i am not a professional lock picker , and i am able to break the combo without any difficulty \( which is a problem with many low quality combo locks , but this design try to avoid it at all \)
like other people here my lock spontaneously changed its combination on me surprise ! my laptop is currently locked up at my desk at work which ruined my day and is ruining my night another stressor i do not need to deal with do not get this lock if you value the mobility of your laptop over a theft deterrant
wiring broke at interface box poor design
i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound i pod headpohones without breaking the bank \( i'm on a plane frequently \) i wanted something that i would n't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels i found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating especially if you like to use only one plug \( like maybe at your desk at work \) the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable even when sitting still so then i thought these will be great workout headphones \( wo n't be upset if i break or lose them \) , however , the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience \( even when you are sitting stationary at your desk \) it is similar to wearing a stethescope , which defeats the point of wearing in the ear headphones \( which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise \) i do not recommend these headphones , because of this stethescope effect i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses \( they are after all designed to wear behind the head \) i'm on the hunt for better quality headphones
i like this style of headphone radio \( especially when i jog \) , and have n't found any similar models that i like this is my third purchase of this radio each of the three have had problems first died completely \( although it was used a lot \) second still works , but last number does n't show up on digital display i wanted a backup in case second died , so i ordered another one this third works least well of all at times , entire display is off , radio does n't work at all , or it wo n't change channels then other times it worked seems like might be affected by heat outside however , i know have another persistent problem that being , it wo n't let me program the preset stations again , i'm limited in my choices , and i use this type headphone a lot so i suffer through poor quality
agree with the prior reviewers i can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses !
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
this mouse was barely functional it did move the arrow across the screen , but it was in a very random fashion i went to the macally website and downloaded the latest drivers still no luck i'm sending this back guess i 'll have to stick with my reliable kensington too bad it 's so ugly and does n't match my ice keyboard oh well function over form
the product description for these speakers is misleading they do not plug directly into a dvd player or game console then , after buying the adapters and doing the initial setup , three of the five speakers did not work perhaps these speakers are a good solution for pcs , but that 's not why we bought them , and we immediately sent them back
isolation
i bought these to replace the standard ipod and sony ear buds i was under the impression that i would get a much deeper bass response i was wrong the bass reproduction is simply horrid i read somewhere there is a break in period i have found this not to be true they sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new this is my first pair of sennheiser and am very disappointed i know they are low end headphones but i expected more my recommendation is to keep researching
cons
item was advertised as white , but it was really grey as a result we had to return item and assume the cost of mailing it back
i bought this phone for use in my home office based on the rave reviews on this site for its speakerphone unfortunately , i have had nothing but repeated complaints that the voice is distorted or goes in and out , with the beginnings and ends of sentences frequently cut off i am in the market for another phone after just 2 months
during the installation of the software on my pc running windows 2000 server , the installation program froze my pc completely i had to turn off the pc , and now it does nothing when i turn it on the lights on the front light up , but nothing happens at all i called netgear , waited on hold for 15 minutes , and then was connected to a gentleman whose english was not very good i explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it he told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with win 2000 server i told him that i had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 pro , but not 2000 server \( perhaps there are some \) , but he insisted that this was the case i explained that , typically , installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user , and exit , rather than freezing and disabling the computer , but he held firm , and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help , and that he recommended that i contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration
i am totally stunned that this could be sold as ipod compatible nothing , absolutely nothing , works as you would intuitively think it would pause does not pause , forward arrow does not forward to the next track \( just starts the same track over and over again \) , and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist there is no way to actually speed through a menu you have to advance one artist at a time this is fine if you love aaron neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to zz top i am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my ipod again from my ipod
i guess for 50 , this is an ok product i am usually very against monster products , but i 'd seen this for almost double at big box retailers , needed a surge protector for my new dlp tv , so figured what the heck it arrived without incident , i hooked it up and so far so good it basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple for the neato effect i guess anyways , no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector but the claims of independent circuitry to minimize cross interference is what i was really interested in , as i have my reciever , cable box , dvd player , and subwoofer all connected all in all a good buy i guess , at least you paid a lot less than retail
i bought one of these a few months ago it worked perfectly with my old thinkpad , but not long thereafter i got a thinkpad t60 , thinking , hey , universal means universal , of course it will work but no six months after the t60 was introduced , kensington still has n't gotten their act together to produce a smarttip for it they have n't even added lenovo to the list of manufacturers on their web site ! all customer service can say is that they do n't have one , they do n't know when or if they ever will , and they suggest that i check back on the website someday if i still hold out any hope so , i have a 100 brick on my hands very disappointing , kensington
i wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my ipod
dvds are less than 30 dollars now with 16x speed
then buy these ridata disc
bought 100 dvd blanks so far every one a coaster never had this kind of problems with any type of discs tried different software and burn speeds but nothing good very disappointed at least they were cheap \( \)
i am looking for a system to replace a siemens 8825
it did not work at all and amazon would not take it back saying it was my responsibility that it did not work i would never buy this or any other product from this seller
i was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls i regularly use plus my fan and light controls however , the harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment i was much better off with the 3 remotes i was using before it was much simpler than fooling with the harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions i never have been able to get the harmony to control the fan and lights
before you buy this drive , be sure to google cypress at2lp rc42 and western digital
while convenient and a nice , lightweight unit , the voice pickup is very poor , regardless of how you adjust the set this is not only with the set i have used , but with others i have talked to you can tell if the person on the other end of the phone is using one of these units because they are so faint i 've gotten so i just ask if they 're using a plantronics cs50 when they are faint and the answer is invariably yes also , if you are in a building with a lot of exposed metal \( window door frames , high cubicles with lots of metal \) , the range deteriorates significantly
for some years i tried this and other monster products , to the tune of over 1000 in monster a v gear the more you learn about video and audio , the more you 'll avoid anything with the monster label specifically , this s video meets no ntsc , dvd or ieee standard it is common 30 ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed , low conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding has a sharp image , but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off color skin tones to color blotching , dirty grays , burned highlights , murky shadows , noisy reds , and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds makes video test patterns look great , but who watches test patterns all day \? amazon offers many other brands at good prices , why waste your on this stuff \? i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar , belden , viewsonics and others from amazon result vast improvement in every respect
i recently purchased this item from sharper image and was very disappointed
i bought this adapter along with the linksys wrt54gl broadband router i managed to set them up and install them properly \( the best advice i got from the home networking for dummies book was to get a 100 foot cat5e patch cable so that i could put my router in the place i where i wanted it , and hook it up with a wired connection first i actually only needed a 50 foot cable , and got it for 20 from a local electronics supply store \)
i have owned the tomtom navigator 5 for almost a year now while the program is well thought out and provides a good function , it does not work well with my tungsten t5 i have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues \( listed below \) , but to no avail
essentially once tomtom has your money they 're finished with you until you want to spend more money with them
the tomtom navigator is a nice enough device , until you get to the maps activation the maps activation \? why should i have to activate my maps if i have paid for the product \? good question , well , i activated these maps on one pda , and within 2 weeks my pda died and i had to obtain warranty service well , i decided that i would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when i got it back from the manufacturers \( i tend to switch my pda every 3 4 months anyway \)
i agree , this is a flimsy piece of plastic that will not hold the gps unit over a few little bumps i expected more from garmin consider this touratech mount for garmin 60c series its a solid unit it costs a little more but you wo n't be replacing your gps unit due to it falling to the ground
my company car has a built in gps unit and i have gotten to like it , sort of i have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around silicon valley enough to get a portable gps unit after some research , the garmin ique 3600 is what i ended up with and i paid about 700 the unique feature of this portable gps unit is that a palmpilot comes integrated into the package i use a palmpilot , so this gps unit replaces my palmv installation was quite awkward , and getting it up and running was a chore i got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now it does do the job , fitfully , and has several glaring issues most irritating , the palm function and the gps function are not seamlessly integrated if an address is entered in the palm part and then route to this address is selected , the ique 3600 makes you find the location but the address from the palm section does n't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address i'm left handed and graffiti has never worked for me all my letters are drawn backward the gps can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go , but my unit takes a good 5 10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky this means that i must have a good idea what to do for the first 5 10 minutes sometimes i just drive randomly until the gps locks in and starts to issue navigation orders also , the antenna must be deployed to get any gps reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky this is ok , except that the ique 3600 does n't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed
summary good idea , very poor implementation good software and easy to use , major problem is reception of radio stations i live in a major metropolitan area and have to practically stand on my head to get the radio shark to get clear reception \( even with a plug in antennae \)
the price on the cases is cheap but you get what you pay for i will never buy these cases again quite a few of them were broke when i got them even the ones that were n't broke are made of very flimsy plastic and i have a feeling they will break if i open them very often they also do n't open and shut very easy look elsewhere for good cases
i bought this and i'm sorry it sounds horrible do n't waste your money because you 'll just have to buy another one anyway for any true enjoyment this crap is barely good enough for my bathroom
they sell these at almost every dollar store , sure the sound quality might not be quite as good , but you 're going to have signal loss whatever you hook it up to these things sell for 1 50 can at dollar stores and are worth every penny of that pric
alright before i begin let me just say i know quite a bit about wireless networking i had already connected 2 wireless pc 's to my 128 bit wep encrypted router i had initially set it up as wpa but opted to change it as this hunk of junk does n't support wpa this card will detect your network no problem , just try connecting to it apparently i am typing in the wrong wep pass i can assure you i am not perhaps there is an issue between micro oft and d link i am unaware of go figure i do not have the time nor patience to deal with micro oft 's customer support regarding this issue back to the store this goes do yourself a favour and do not buy this
microsoft has never failed to disappoint me , \( i suppose there is something to be said for consistency \) and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition i bought this with a the mn 700 wireless router , and both worked fine for a couple weeks however , they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning this card was the most maddening of the pair , because it would find the wireless network every once in a while , yet refuse to connect i 've tried every channel , and made sure its on infrastructure mode , but it still refuses to work i suppose i deserve it , though , expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking , like linksys or belkin whatever you do , give as little money as possible to this shoddy company
i returned this product after a week it was difficult to manage , the screen way too small to read \( and i have 20 10 vision ! \) and just a very disappointing product overall do not waste your money i ended up buying a samsung and i could n't be more happy
i just purchased this printer last night at bestbuy and took it home when i removed the contents of the box , i noticed that the usb cord was not in there i read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately i could n't believe it so , i went to the store and bought one this cost me an additional 11 i went home , installed the software and plugged everything in i printed off a few things and it looked great today , i went to use the printer again and the power woud n't turn on ! i disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power ! i tried several more things and still could n't turn the power on now i have to return it to bestbuy this was the first and last time i will ever buy anything from hp ! !
we purchased this system less than two years ago it has seen light to moderate use several days ago , the speakers started intermittently cutting out this afternoon , the subwoofer popped several times then caught fire ! fortunately , my son was able to extinguish the flames before much damage was done beware ! ! ! !
i do not recommend sennheiser 's mx75 headphones
i bought this tv for my husband to take hunting but we ca n't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture the tv is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen i did n't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we do n't have cable i tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other i tried programming with the antenna on the tv and with separate rabbit ears it would only pick up one of the three local network stations it picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which are n't popular i could n't get a good picture on any of the stations and i tried adjusting all the menu items , brightness , hue , etc it did n't even have a good black and white picture it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back sooooo , sooo disappointed because i wanted to be able to use this at work too
i wanted a keyboard that i could use in low light with both my pc and mac , and this one is reasonably o k those users who enjoy the backlight of a mac powerbook or macbook pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach saitek used to illuminate the keys , though on the mac , each key has its own embedded light under the key on the saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard , reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys but it 's better than nothing , and is helpful in low light it would have also been nice if they had an fn key , but such is life
i purchased my fuji compactflash xd card adapter elsewhere and it does n't work in my hp officejet 7130 all in one it wo n't load in as it 's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards except then i get an amber light that says there is a card error this is supposed to work with my all in one but it does n't for that reason , i 'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed i'm going to take this cp version back and hope the more updated cpf version works i'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles , but i'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly this one is definitely a thumbs down however , this is my first dud fuji product i 've bought and i love fuji digital cameras
mine worked fine for about a month before it stopped working dealing with d link is n't a pleasure either
if you have a tekxon digital camera do not get this because when you put the memory card in and you turn the camera on the screen goes black !
my brother got a lexar for christmas he put it in his tungsten c and for 30 stressful minutes the card did not work the device recognized the card , but you could not copy , format , nothing just got an error this card is read only and cannot be whatever quot then all of a sudden it started working 2 stars for the stress and for the fear that it will stop working again
everything your read about the picture quality is true however , this product just is n't reliable cost me another 600 to get it fixed and it is n't even 18 months old i am sure i am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues customer service from this company is also very poor if i had it to do over i would not have purchased this product and i probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed i think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune
like most have pointed out , it 's a digital signal and there 's no need for all the gas injected , gold plated , shielded stuff monster cables hype for analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside em interference
bought this and plugged it in and backedup some files , went to transfer them to another computer and the drive was dead , i treid a few computers and no of them could regonize the drive i guess i have one of the many bad ones
others have written about this phone not holding the charge , and i agree ! i ca n't tell you how many times a call has gone dead in the middle of a conversation , with no warning , no low battery message i 've only had the phone since november there is not a quick , convenient way to redail numbers you have to choose from a list of options , 1 plus number , or the area code without the 1 , or no 1 and no area code no easy way to speed dial range is disappointing i'm looking for a new phone back to uniden or panasonic
after burning one coaster , i thought , it 's just a fluke i 'll burn my first dvd in no time i was wrong after updating the firmware on my new plextor dvd burner and downloading the latest version of nero 6 , i burned two more coasters do n't buy these unless you want pain and frustration
plays fine on the first layer but picture will freeze during layer switch i either have to stop or skip pass the chapter but picture will be jumping and pixellated , pretty much unwatchable
dissapointing the sping loaded connectors at the back of the selector are not particularly strong , so thick or rigid cables under tension \( e g twisted at odd angles \) easily slip out the depth of the connectors is also not great , so wires cannot be inserted very far to compensate for the lack of traction connections might be better using monster cables' own angled gold pin connectors , but i did n't try those
on the good side , it was easy to set up , and worked reasonably well if the phone \( tried both cordless and corded \) was plugged directly into unit however , i could not get it to work on other phones in the house when i used the jack to plug it into the wall per the instructions \( so it would work like a land line on any phone in the house \) i do not have a land line , so it may just need a land line to work since you are supposed to be able to switch back and forth i even tried disconnecting the line outside the house but that did n't work either
i bought this a few weeks ago so that i could connect a cordless phone to my office computer and use skype for my calling when it works , it works well , and the sound quality is fine unfortunately , much of the time , it does n't work it drops calls at random customer support is dismal , i emailed them several days ago and did n't even get a response acknowledging the email , let alone a solution to my problem just now i have tried reinstalling the drivers but that seems to be failing
the connection keeps coming loose and now it doesnt work unless you hold it in place useless and a waste of mone
i really wanted to like this mouse but so far it has given me nothing but grief if you plan on leaving your computer on for extended periods of time and then coming back to it to do some work you may find that your scroll wheel no longer scrolls pages i have had to on several occasions unplug and replug in my mouse in order to get the scroll wheel working again this is absolutely unexceptible logitech ! what happened to logitech \? you used to be able to count on them for quality products now i am wondering if i should switch back to micro oft products i may give the micro oft laser mouse 6000 a try and take the mx 400 back
like the forward back buttons but they are located too far back on the body for comfort like the scroll wheel and side to side scroll ability pointer flickers a lot sometimes and often disappears over certain buttons logitech website gives no help
i have the same issue as misleading item description below the only reason i bought this is because i thought it was the complete set what good is a headset without the base \?
i bought this rikaline gps 6010 a month ago i tried to make it work for hundreds times , but it only worked once evertime when i turned on the gps , it was always telling me it was initializing and then it just stopped working i hate this thing because it embarrassed me before my friends
mine actually works and i still hate it
i bought two of these cards to go alongside my wrt54gs i though that they should work great together since they are from the same manufacturer oh boy was i wrong
i got this toy for christmas ilove it i abanded this toy , and it got some brudle hits it was still alive ! know i keep safe becuse i do n't want it to die i do n't think this toy is a wast of money mine is ginger it came with a silver grey newborn kittin
these speakers are o k , but do n't expect high sound quality \( i bought these as refurbs , so maybe that is it , but when you turn up the volume , they do n't sound good i 'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new \) also , probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight that is , they fade in and out when you walk around the room this should not be a problem on this low bandwidth \( but it is \) , perhaps the antenna needs a boost
too much static with snapping and popping even after making all of the adjustments possible the speakers are only 10 feet away from the transmitter but still poor to marginal sound quality do n't see how these could work 300 feet away \( \? \) i do not recommend this product
cheap piece of junk probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it i'm returning it to wallmart it might work ok if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter otherwise it 's just too weak in its signal pulling ability also , when i turn the gain dials , they do n't seem like they are really variable i think they are really just on off switches disguised as variable dials , because i do n't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels i'm going to now go to a real , serious electronics store and look for some serious tv electronics hardware instead of wallmart garbage i'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and i'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if i can find one \( a high quality one , not junk \) i tried a preamp from wallmart \( which was n't adjustable at all \) and it did help a lot with uhf channels , but the vhf channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong so i need a variable gain preamp , assuming there is such a thing i would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them i did yesterday and there 's a lot of good stuff i never knew before
i live in a particularly bad spot for tv reception and have been forced to use cable this antenna brings in several local stations but the quality of the picture is unsatisfactory so , unfortunately , for me it 's either back to cable or try an amplified outside antenna
yeah , they claim this thing works with ms powerpoint but what they do not tell you is that it only works with part of powerpoint it only works in slide mode it does not work in presentation view mode of course , most of my presentations are run in presentation view mode
i wish the description had beem better somethimg like this phone needs another unit to work ! people who have never seen an expansion phone can be missled like i was returned item
the antenna did not work at all ! save your money !
i recieved this unit 3 bussiness days after i ordered it fast shipping
phone seemed nice but i bought it to hang on a wall and it would n't due to manufacturing
all i wanted was something to make the incoming audio louder while listening to a call and typing during an interview i could n't find just a headset amp so i purchased this system based on plantronics' good name
i never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones i could n't get them to stay in on my ears the loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome these may fit men with bigger ears better but i would n't recommend them for females
i like the color and sony 's technology of the earphone itself
the device is well built but has one major flaw the adhesive comes in 2 types , removable and permanent types neither adhesive would stick to the dash of my jeep liberty i'm not sure what i'm going to do with it now , it appears as though i'm going to either have to find a more permanent mounting solution or find another type of adhesive
after two weeks of use , i returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times i tried to make a right click , it would not work i eventually got frustrated and decided to return it
i had high hopes for this headset i found that i could not hear anything when i attached it to my treo 650 the treo uses a standard plug i verified that my treo is working by attaching a stereo headset
my friend bought one and i tried to set it up for him let me tell you , this thing is pure garbage i spent a good hour and a half trying to get it to work i tried to set it up using 2 laptops which were set up exactly how the booklet outlined the direct ethernet connection would n't work and connecting to it through wireless was spotty at best i could sometimes get into the setup page through wireless , but all of a sudden the setup page would stop working
i got this print server about a month back initially it took me 4 hours to get this thing installed and running in the wireless mode ! after i got it setup , it worked fine for a week but , then the wireless connection with the print server got flaky , so i switched to the wired mode all was well again , but then after a couple of weeks the wired connection got flaky it stopped printing and did n't recognize my hp 1200 after fiddling around with it for a few hours i finally got the contraption working again
this thing does a horrible job at detecting wifi networks i have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50 signal \( even though i can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection \) if it does detect bluetooth , which half the time it does n't \( regardless of it being active \) , it cancels out the wifi detection so if you have a bluetooth headset , and you 're talking , the thing will just let you know that yes , there is a bluetooth device around thanks i was wondering
my husband bought me this for christmas because we were moving to a new city he picked it out because unlike garmin and magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road the features are easy to use , the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic it really comes up with a great plan however my first one lasted 3 months before it died , i then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well i was very reluctant to buy a different brand but had to for dependability i still do n't like my garmin as much but at least it works come on tomtom get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions
i'm a longtime user of wacom intuos tablets and i was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2 5ghz g5 there were no wireless intuos products available at the time of purchase , so i went with the graphire bluetooth unfortunately , the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use , i plan on returning it the major problem lies with the pen both in design and responsiveness
i know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini \( pink \) is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge \( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies \) is about 2 hours apple will gladly sell me a new \( 70 \) battery , but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products i'm not saying do n't buy it there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me , i think i'm going to dig out my old discman
i returned this thing the day after i bought it
after only a couple of months of light use , the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working as soon as power is connected to the sub woofer , the loud thumping starts i exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks ! ! a total piece of junk
while a nice product packed with great features when it works , the bottom line is that it does not support twain drivers , meaning you can not scan through any application other than scansnap big minus
just plugged it in and i'm ready to ship it back creates an annoying , high pitched buzz
i was hoping that by getting this i 'd get a decent flow of air and i 'd be able to use it anywayer but i was sorely dissappointed it does n't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel plus its too loud to use in most places
the battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal after charging it all night , it dies after a few hours of nonuse
we bought a set of these phones because they looked nice , and because at t is a reliable company but these phones are the worst after having them for about 3 weeks , we began having terrible results with the volume speakers in the phones i took them back , and got a new set these lasted about twice as long , before the battery life just became worthless we are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time say , 1 hour and you ca n't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out , and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again and yes , we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge , and all that kind of stuff still i have never used a more frustrating phone , nor will i ever purchase an at t phone again i bought a new phone today , and once fully charged , i will take these at t phones out back and smash them with a hammer
i have to agree with many others about the poor quality of this phone the battery life decreased rapidly and after several weeks i was forced to keeps both phones on their chargers instead of gambling on replacement cells i bought a panasonic phone as suggested by other disappointed at t model 2255 buyers
i also was suckered in by the monster name i have an older sony adapter that i 've used in the past with no problems but could n't locate it right before a road trip , so i bought this one also this actually sounds substantially worse than my actual cassettes \( even though they 're all over 10 years old \)
i attempted to use this product in my 2002 chevy tahoe factory audio system as others here noted , the deck would quickly error and eject the monster adapter the monster adapter did work in my 2000 harley davidson fltri factory audio system the difference is that the harley unit does not have cut tape detection the tahoe does
i lost my adapter that came from walmart and was a generic brand it worked perfect this thing was expensive and it did n't work at all i 'd have to turn the volume on both the ipod and stereo all the way up and then i 'd get some sign of life , not anything you 'd want to listen to it 's worst than even the worst rf transmitter i 've ever tried do n't waste your money , believe the reviews
i bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features , but soon discovered that it ca n't normally do the one thing that all gpss should , tell you where you are i used my e trex vista for about a year and half and would estimate that i spent 10 to 15 of the time staring at some type of lost signal message the unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days , which means about half the time in the seattle area where i live i would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy
i had this gps device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre
garmin 's devices are pretty good somewhat tempermental , but mostly reliable it 's connecting their software and dealing with garmin support that is a nightmare and , you will need to call them because their software has all kinds of bugs and an archaic key system customer service hold time 30 35 minues response time for email tech requests a staggering 5 7 working days clearly garmin does not care about its customers
when these headphones are working , they are great i never have trouble receiving sound they are amazingly comfortable great battery life , and batteries are rechargeable long distance is great too , i can walk throughout the whole house on multiple floors without any trouble
after having an experience with slow startup speeds \( and actually freezing a computer \) with the 1gb cruzer micro with u3 , i feel compelled to write this negative review the mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives a fast and higlhly compatible interface any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability i work at an educational institution wher i am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive as a matter of policy , we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background
i bought the cruzer micro not knowing that it came with the u3 launch pad software preloaded as soon as i tried to use it on my computer at work , the company 's anti virus firewall decided it was an intruder , preventing it from working at all i was ticked i had almost given up on it and was actually shopping around for another usb drive that had no software on it , when i ran into a website that lets you download an uninstaller for the u3 launch pad i downloaded it , ran it and it took no more than 15 seconds to clean out the offending u3 garbage ! now i like my micro cruzer all over again ! oh yeah the website to uninstall yours at is
i wish i had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk as another reviewer says , u3 ruins it i have a mac so that feature is useless , but even worse it cannot be disabled everytime i plug in the drive i get this cheesy cd image cluttering up my desktop and i have to eject it , along with the drive icon , before the unit can be removed what clunky engineering i 'll be returning this and scratching sandisk off my list of reliable companies i also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging it is impossible to open without tearing it apart , which is probably a strategy to reduce returns
spare sd card slots molded into the lid of this case prevent it from closing completely around the tungsten e you will see a noticeable gap around the bottom edge of the closed case slight pressure on the latch side side will cause the case to pop open unexpectedly in purse or brief case i returned mine to amazon a few days after receipt still looking for an alternative
with a destructive toddler in the house i like to back up my dvd movies
i bought this thing becuase i use voice recognition with my computer and i'm on the phone quite a bit it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets with the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it the total cost came to around 200 yay !
just a fair warning to all out there considering this card after purchasing this card it worked great then in the middle of my friend 's wedding the card no longer was readable by my camera i could not believe it ! when i got home i put the original card in the camera and it worked fine i reformatted this card and still the camera could not read the card not worth the money for only one years use
i have the canon rebel i had the same problem where files were corrupted also , when clearing the card , some pics stayed filed i am not happy with this flashcard at all
it does n't work properly i can charge the ipod but it does n't let me sync sent an email to the seller but no answer so far !
do not buy this crappy piece of junk ! !
we needed to know if this unit \( philips dvd 782c \) was compatible with dvd rw disks so i googled it and found this amazon listing
unfortunately my wife and i purchased this product without reading the posted reviews here all are entirely accurate ! i cannot calculate how many hours i have spent trying to figure out what is wrong no loading , skipping , freezing , not opening when it freezes , all down the line , combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their defective dvds my wife was firmly of the belief the dvds were just dirty but i finally decided \( this agrees with one of the reviewers \) there is a balance problem in the drawer when there is a no load , jiggling adjusting the drawer sometimes \( not always \) fixes it , but only until the next time , and will not stop the freezing problems if my wife had a dime for every time i said this thing is a piece of amp ! quot she would be a millionaire this is very late but if this product is still on the market in any form stay many miles away and philips' arrogant lack of response \( as reported i have no personal experience here \) is virtually criminal in this day and age
for some years i tried this and other monster products , to the tune of over 1000 in monster a v gear the more you learn about video and audio , the more you 'll avoid anything with the monster label specifically , this s video meets no ntsc , dvd or ieee standard it is common 30 ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed , low conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding has a sharp image , but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off color skin tones to color blotching , dirty grays , burned highlights , murky shadows , noisy reds , and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds makes video test patterns look great , but who watches test patterns all day \? amazon offers many other brands at good prices , why waste your on this stuff \? i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar , belden , viewsonics and others from amazon result vast improvement in every respect
i bought the mvsv3 1m cable and put it between my pioneer v555 dvd player and sony wega tv kv 27fs12 , i was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality , color , sharpness same as the result as i used the composite cable came with the box i really do n't know why i have to say , my tv is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even i do n't use dvd player unfortunately my dvd player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video experience i do n't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one , i was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance we just do n't have a benchmark to evaluate it
i bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews i read here i should have read further , because about two weeks after i purchased the earphones , the left side went out completely there was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and i did n't hear any rattling as described by other users the darn things just quit ! i must say , however , that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent , but all in all , not worth the money and frustration
cowon aka iaudio have the worst customer service of any other major company i dealt with no phone support , they have an 800 number but when you call it they direct you to their website their website support gives you the option to submit a ticket or live chat i waited over an hour on their live chat before i get a message saying that live chat is not available at this time i submitted a ticket guess how long before i heard a response the response was ship the item back for a refund i also tried to download the latest firmware and the link was broken i heard a lot about how bad their customer service was , but when i tried it myself it was even worse
these batteries are not sold by amazon they are sold by an amazon re seller called electrogalaxy please read the reviews of this company before purchasing i do not recommend this company due to their poor return policy and terrible customer service you have been officially warned do not buy anything from electrogalaxy
i went and got this keyboard after the first one broke i found the keys were re arranged instead of hitting home i wound up deleting my work
problem 1 out of hte box , these units are assigned 192 168 0 10 as an ip address find if your network is on the 0 subnet so i had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured
i have a d link router , and i could n't even get this thing to connect wirelessly it works if connected with a ethernet wire , but that is n't really the point , is it \?
i bought this unit over a year ago and still have n't figured out how to work it i have used the d link wireless router with no trouble , but no matter what i do , i ca n't get the print server to work properly this is after hours with their customer service people and doing everytihing possible based on other people 's reviews this unit actually does work it just has n't for me
after 3 hours of banging my head against a wall i finally called tech support they finally figured out that this is not compatible with multi function computers you can learn that on their support website but no where in the standard documentation that comes with it
before you buy anything from creative , google the words incompatible legacy drivers sounblaster windows xp
i bought this machine based on the good reviews i found here i have had it for one month and it does nothing but jam now the two week return policy at the store has expired and i am left with a jamming piece o' junk
i am shocked by the amount of positive reviews on this site let me tell you about my experience i bought this machine in june of 2005 in one year , i have replaced this machine three times all three times , i got error messages that the toner cartridge was out \( toner life end \) even when new toner cartridges were put in i do give high marks to brother for its customer service , though each time i had a problem , i called and they sent out a replacement by fedex along with materials for me to send back the broken one but when the fourth replacement arrived last week and i turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message , i had enough i had a similar issue with a brother mutlifunction machine i purchased around the same time i am done with brother products
i ordered this keyboard mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth , so i returned it i'm sure it would have been great if i had used it but my mac has blue tooth and i thought i was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse
i purchased this for my intel imac mainly because i was so frustrated with the mighty mouse i wanted something with two separate buttons i had tried the logitech mx 610 \( which i purchased as well for another computer \) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful so , i purchased this desktop set because i wanted it to match my mac and so i could have a proper 2 button mouse i figured the mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well in fact , i thought i would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a mac and had extra shortcut buttons
love this phone if only the caller id would work ! it worked fine on day 1 , day 2 worked on and off day 3 caller id not working tried moving the phone to different outlets , removing the batteries putting them back in , tried new wire etc the phone works great otherwise loved the caller id when it was working much larger than most and easy to read oh well
after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling it lasted 5 months you cannot get through on their help line and they do not answer their e mail buy a nwb phone at your own risk i had to buy another phone at t and it works fine
i am comparing these transfers to the hp transfers for colored shirts these require a reverse image and are just not user friendly after three unsuccessful attempts i just went back to the more expensive hp 's the transfers did not adhere well and would flake off in little chunks even before you tried to wash them
these sound awful i'm embarrassed to admit i spent 140 00 on these the earphones from my 1989 sony walkman are far superior if you like your music to sound as if it came from the bottom of a well then these are for you
bought these pretty cheap , from woot com
the toshiba vcr combo arrived , and was quite light in weight it hooked up ok , but the orange \( nice color \) display , constantly stayed on zeros , and the vcr played tapes so bad , there was always a white static streak across the screen bottom i sent it back after trying a few tapes \( all tested poor \) better to get a good vcr for good vhs picture display quality
i bought this unit because a dlink sales rep said it would be perfect for my application hah ! it does n't work at all \( i hope amazon will let me return it \) the first thing i had to do was upgrade the firmware no instructions on how to do this , but for the uninitiated you have to download the ftp file from dlink , move it to the dlink firmware folder on your computer , then get the ap manager to see your unit \( that 's another story involving ip addresses again , no help from the install documents \) , and then you can install the update i finally got the dwl 2100ap to see my network , but never could get it to talk back it just sent gibberish the net tech and i worked on it for most of two working days , to no avail spent a lot of time on the phone with the dlink tech staff too , where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff , but that we might get it to work , provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah , blah , blah my assessment of dlink and the dlink dwl 2100ap \? poor pre sales support , poor post sales support , confusing tech support , and poor documentation install instruction for a product that may be \( but then again , may not be \) compatible with your existing equipment what 's up dlink
when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was angry i tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a hassle i decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was bad the only thing i could have done is to buy a new adapter so i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to work i was furious
my family and i just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while when i saw the microsoft lifecam at target stores and that it was compatible with windows live i thought it would be worth the 100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family
dont microsoft ever send their software thru quality assurance checking \? they asked me to install a windows update \( kb something or the other \) saying that it prevented the software from running at 100 cpu usage lo and behold , it still gets stuck ! ! task manager dutifully reports that it is after all consuming all resources
i 've found these headphones to be highly overrated
in terms of sound quality , noise cancelling , and general comfort thise headphones are top of the line i absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide i used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying , and i always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation i was even able to listen to drum n bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end
someone previously pointed out that these earphones did not filter out the highs well it may be the highs all i know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around
i got avaya roadwarrior up and running on my computer to use when i work remotely my co worker told me to get a gn netcom headset but i figured i 'd save some money and get this one big mistake
it failed dragon naturally speaking 's sound tests , tests easily passed by the cheapo mike included with the program and just try to return it antonline stonewalls , plantronics does n't respond at all
gave it one star because there was no option for zero died after two days of use , would not turn on or reset previous zen nano , same thing after six months of use i guess that would be my last creative product
the first warning sign is that the drivers are not windows approved and unsigned their installation instructions advise you to ignore the warnings
the router card does not work , my old one works with the new router but the new card does not work at all , so i need a refund for it , or a replacement , thanks
i bought it with my linksys wrt54gs wireless g broadband router with speedbooster the software installation procedure is really poor when i ran the software first few times it constantly gave me error messages \( ca n't remember what they were \) so i had to reinstall it 2 3 time till it settled down finally then i set up the network settings with my router and scanned for the access point \( infrastructure \) but it could n't find anything even though the router was only 5 7 feet away ! at one point it managed to connect to the router but it was still searching for the internet connectivity after several minutes it could n't find anything and disconnected from the router i knew there was nothing wrong the router or internet because i inserted my old belkin adapter and it connected straight away !
this product keeps changing home addresses none of which are the address i typed in the initial field it does not stay charged so that it is actually able to function as advertised if you are gone from home any length of time and you put your dog in a yard additionally , gravity takes it down to the lower neck area in common use so that when the dog is doing normal dog things , the device sinks downward so that the antenna is pointing toward the ground the pictures are misleading we tried all of the advise the company gave us it 's just not a device that works when and where you need it to work it was a lot to invest to have this many problems
it 's called a leash or a fence how about keeping your pet safe the responsible not to mention cheap way
a nice device , but microsoft did n't include software that encrypts the fingerprint image although very difficult to do someone could steal your fingerprint to be safe i would not use this fingerprint reader for password protected websites that contain sensitive information or for network admin or computer bios privledges
this camera had some nice features like the ability to write to a network storage device , smart motion detection , etc the recorded videos have their own codec so you can use it or d vix some videos are unreadable and if you dig deep enough , d link has a utility to make them readable
camera will not stay up on wireless network with dlink router ! firmware has some serious issues dlink support was worthless i returned the camera and bought a panasonic and never looked back
it would be really great if amazon and other resellers did a better job outlining which accessories were compatible with which products this is stated as a cf type i card yet this does not work with a nikon coolpix 4300 another , more expensive kingston card , must be used
i have several pairs of portable speakers for my laptop but forgot to bring them on a recent trip and bought these based on the glowing reviews posted here however , when i received the speakers i found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the creative speakers they have a huge and unstable footprint when opened \( about 9 inches long and one inch deep \) and are not particularly compact when folded either the sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast , then begin to buzz i do not recommend these speakers
i bought this for my 5g ipod i drive a late model subaru with the lighter switch inside of the ashtray console firstly the transmitter was completely dangerous to operate while driving its impossible to use in park and neutral in my car the controls are bulky the transmission cut out in mountains , on hills , and on the highway whenever i drove over 60mph resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console in short , it hardly worked and i was afraid to touch it while driving , lest i 'd knock my gear shift out of place its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk
worked well for a while \( 2 weeks \) , the sound always had static , later the sound went really low and then it just died
i have the same problem some other reviewers had the audio was extremely low unless i manually adjust the cassette it 's not that easy you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there , and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts but that does n't always work if that does n't work , you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit i 'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either \( 1 \) fiddling with the audio , or \( 2 \) smashing the adapter into little pieces while i drive
after using this sd card only twice , it can not be recognized by any of my card reader totally a waste of money and time do not buy pny brand
i had dcs 900w from the same product line it craped out after 9 months , and now i am on the fifth call to try to resolve the issue and get it shipped back i do n't know where their support is located , but the line quality is very bad , they ran the same drill over and over , but just do n't want to issue you an order for you to ship back
yesterday was the annual thanksgiving sale day i got this 1g cf card from staples by 40 after easy rebate with this price , i think it is a great deal however , it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was dead all my photos in the card were lost i am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering , i know how to recover data if a hard drive fails but this time , i find i simply ca n't help fortunately , staples have a good return policy and i just returned it without hassle hopefully , this is only my case my suggestion make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item
of course as all things computer related , as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically unit works great but buy the 2 gig more bang for the
the card failed after 23 pictures amazon credited me with a full purchase price credit to my credit card account
i was on hold 50 minutes , 52 seconds before anybody answered i heard your call is important to us at least 100 times , which was n't very convincing
i bought this reader for my laptop since it did n't have usb 2 0
note i am fully aware that compact flash cards have a maximum sustained upload speed which caps off the potential speed of the medium it is being transferred on
and the worst part is that i'm actually glad about it !
i bought this keyboard mouse set hoping to consolidate most of my wireless devices onto a single hub and standard
speaking from real experience , do n't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price i bought a few top of the line monster cables once i got the top of the line sony xbr960 hdtv later on i switched cables around , with other brand , cheaper component cables such as philips pts1000 \( the hdmi standard owner by the way \) , and also other hdmi cables \( even no name brands coming with my dvd player \) you know what \? i see absolutely no difference even under close examination the sony xbr960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any tv you think about what that means stop buying this ridiculously priced cables , and save your and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list digital is digital do n't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 than others
basically a nice phone , but
i purchased the kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise i heard and read a lot about the problems with fm transmitters , like static and audio quality but the kensington was the best rated unit
i had a monster icarplay for some time and had givben it to a friend so when i was looking for a new one i thought i 'd try the kensington
using this in my wife 's expedition is very annoying for some reason the cord must be placed in exactly the right position or static will drown out the music coming from the car 's speakers note that no other electrical devices in this car \( and there are a lot of them she got every option available with the car \) misbehave at all i would not repeat this purchase , not can i recommend anyone else buy one of these i only gave it two stars because with continual minor effort it can be made to work acceptably however , fiddling with the cord while driving is certainly not a safe practice
new are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry i personally submitted for repair both a 1 , 600 video camera \( sony dcr pc5 \) and a car cd player \( a sony cdx c90 , a 1 , 200 in dash top of the line unit if you 've heard of it , you know what i'm talking about \) i was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera \( some ambiguous statement about logic board , power unit , etc failure followed \) , and would have to pay 780 to have it fixed i naturally refused , and was forced to keep my dead 4 month old handycam , an unfortunate testament to some of sony 's now widely publicized qc issues the reason i did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my cd player i was told , explicitly , that if new could not fix it , they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of 1 , 000 \( not even enough to cover the cost of the player \) as an added insult , when they indeed could not fix the unit , they kept it , and i never received a check ! ! ! simply outrageous ! blatant theft , and i'm not the only one who will tell you a story about new and such an act they are impossible to get ahold of , and literally take your money and run disappear do n't expect to ever hear from them , should your camera stop working , and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand chances are , you will have to eat the loss , as i did this product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund i seriously thought it was a gag when i saw new was in charge of the coverage what a joke ! whoever runs your company , new , ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused the whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison
i originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan three days after , i had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons however the 161 80 total i spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have i received a confirmation that it will be refunded after several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund they finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process that is two whole months horrible service i ca n't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered i would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by n e w customer service companies to anyone
the sound is really great , but there is one problem with this headphones they keep falling from my ears no matter what rubber caps \( they come with 3 different sizes \) i used the design flaw makes them unusable for me
the absolutely worst headphones i have ever had trying the different sizes , the earplugs just do n't want to stay in my ears \( even standing still \) the headphones that come with the i pod , and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better the sound was fine , but not any better than the standard headphones a poor product i was very disappointed , as i have had good experiences in general with apple in the past
ok , after reading the multiple good reviews on amazon i persuaded myself to buy these speakers thinking some people were just pessimistic ok , i got these and immediately put a pair of batteries in these things sound absolutely awful , it goes about the volume of someone quietly talking and the sound is distorted and fuzzy , forget about any bass absolutely do not buy these things oh yeah , whoever has been rating these things as good must be working for sony or something cu these things are terribl
to anyone who may like these , i am sorry to learn about your hearing disability the t33 looked like a nice little package , but i thought , how could it possibly sound even acceptable \? i hoped for a sony surprise , but it did n't happen when i returned them later that day , the clerk asked ,
i was excited about these headphones because creative usually has great products
i really wanted to like the tomtom navigator 5
it is not as good as recommended the image is really unclear when the light is not strong , and it 's totally white under strong light the contrast is low
at the moment i am in the middle of a 3 day ordeal sorting out outlook 2002 , which comes with the ipaq outlook 2002 has many many many known bugs \( which only now i find out \) and i ca n't for the life of me figure out why hp would ship it with their hardware do not install outlook 2002 on your machine
i 'll admit , i'm not the techno wizard some on this panel seem to be , but then again , i do n't believe you should have to be to operate what should be something simple , like a handheld computer
i like the light that goes on when the phone rings but that is about all i like about this phone friends tell me i sound like i am under water and i have had to terminate many conversations due to static and interference one friend insists that i have a microwave running as we speak i am actively looking for a new set to buy because these are worthless
it looked flashy and well conceived on the web shopping sites that featured it however , after setting up panasonic 's kx tg5576m , i'm underwhelmed first of all , even in this day and age , it 's not mac compatible \( though the pansonic call center representative had assured me , after checking with her superior , that it indeed was \) so , i cannot comment on downloading ringtones , wallpapers , etc \( meanwhile , these mobile phone like features were the main reason i wanted this particular cordless phone \)
i cannot recommend hp to anybody anymore the company introduced regional coding , which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another for most this is probably not an issue , for those busily traveling around it is also , it is an issue of principle , its bad enough for dvd , but printer cartridges \? hp has introduced this rather secretely and if you do n't read the box cover etc very carefully , you may not notice the main issue is in europe i got caught out i bought a 3 catridges overseas i could not use them on my hp printer i asked for a refund , hp email support \( us \) was nice but ineffective hp customer support \( europe \) was snotty and very rude i think hp does not care about its customers and this cost me over us 75 , almost 50 of my printer \( my sixth and last hp \) do n't buy hp
i cannot review this item since i have not received it so far at the shipping address i gave amazon when i did the purchase
i agree with the viewer preceding me very tinny the ones i was using from my old computer sound 100 better these are a complete waste two stars because i do hear the music but it sounds awful
these speakers were a major disappointment i have speakers that are about 5 years old , and wanted to replace them but these sony speakers were awful the sound was tinny , the bass was almost non existent , and the sound was probably worse than that coming from my built in laptop speakers
these ear buds are large and hard they have sharp edges and hurt my ears i have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me these were not only painful but did not enhance the sound , but actually reduced it this product should be taken off the market
using rechargeable aaa batteries , with the battery saver feature turned on , about two hours sometimes i get more using alkalines , but not much more honestly , this unit is worthless , because i ca n't trust the batteries
this did not live up to its price or my expectations i walk to work and there was static on both am and fm
takes 3 aaa batteries that in our experience run out too quick other units we 've owned have lower battery drain also the lcd display has poor contrast all in all , i 'd buy another one that costs a few bucks more
i ordered this charger a month ago since , they 've sent me three chargers all the same , all wrong they 've sent me the shuffle charger three times in a row do n't waste your money on this product , for a few bucks more you can get a company that will actually send you the right product the first time
bought a cell phone battery that , of course , died one week past their return refund deadline refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again consider yourself warned
i purchased a unit recently and after a couple hours tinkering with it , i could n't get it to work i called actiontec vosky support and spent almost an hour on the phone with them they advised me to uninstall their software and skype and to try reinstalling each product when that did n't work , they told me the product was defective unfortunately , they refused to take it back themselves and made me deal with the seller \( antonline com \) first \( not a very good seller , btw , as they gave me a terrible time when i tried to return the defective product \)
if your cars dash is curved or sloping , this mount will not work did not work on a 1988 mercedes 300e or a daewoo lanos it might work if you have a perfectly flat dash i had to return the item as it did not sit properly even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down those of you who are clean freaks like me , beware products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand ! i would not trust a 800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down what about jolts and bumps while normal driving \? i did not wait to find out using my 800 gps as an experiment
i bought this to run ethernet into my daughter 's room the powerline etherernet works flawlessly , i 've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms the wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after 24 48 hours of operation , so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network , and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect i am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module
i posted a review two weeks ago , but it has n't appeared , so i'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove \( note despite what some other reviewers seem to think , it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock \) recently , the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook , despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support , i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently , the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook , i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus
we drink a lot of coffee all day , every day so we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher tasting we first bought the 10 cup capresso mt 500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly the coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it so instead of another expensive capresso replacement , we decided to try a japanese model which we thought might be more reliable we have been using the zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly no leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the capresso unfortunately , there is no water filter system in this model compared to others \( we had taken this for granted and not checked for it \) and no reuseable metal mesh filter \( that i could find on the market \) instead of paper filters the water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds we are not sure why our coffee just does n't taste very good anymore , but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality today , we pulled out our very old krups proaroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement we will use this and the zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new capresso coffeemaker replacement do n't waste your money on this zojirushi model unless you do n't care about taste it was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine
everyone has already covered the basics , so here 's the highlights
i purchased this unit not for gaming , but for making pc to pc calls here are my observations
the headset sits on the back of head , which is ok , however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable i was not able to use volume control , as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level
i have been using the palmone navigator with my tx for about eight weeks most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built in navigation system in my lexus
the good news is that this is a full featured gps solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book maps are detailed and the poi \( point of interest \) database is fairly extensive
i have a 5gb but a lot of the h10 's are having the same problem i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and ca n't be reinstalled i 've done a little research about the disappearing mp3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the h10 's and 1 other model i ca n't remember right now and iriver ca n't figure it out although i 've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug so buy with caution
i went looking at fry 's for a mapping software and bought this before looking online at reviews i'm now stuck with a bazillion \( ok , just 17 \) cds and a product that takes minutes to load once you initiallize the program i still ca n't figure out how to access any info on hawaii or alaska and i'm waiting each time an average of four days before tech support haha will write me back
sorry , the speakers do n't attach well , and the quality of these stands is not what i'm used to with a bose system
these cds burn fine but they wo n't play in most cd players i 've tried it in two car aftermarket cd players , brand new mazda , and a brand new f1500 they all did not read the cd most computers can read them , but other than that they are not very usable
for over eight years \( nearly 9 \) , i had an acer 17 crt loved it i use a kvm to switch computers , the crt kept all of my adjustments for that computer , every time
the keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling
ive had this unit for over a 1 year and ran into problems with reception it would drop signal and it would eventual come back i found out that this unit had a defect and the xm rep said i could get a replacement for 50 ! ! ! they didnt figure to tell anybody about this \? if this is true i would not recommend xm radio at all
i have to admit , the price of this item got me it 's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely it worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy the quaility was that of an am radio station recently , it quit working altogether so now i am back in the market for one that will work
unfortunately the item did n't work the company offered to replace it but i just decided to pay more and buy locally
it is an okay printer \( i have n't done photos yet \) and pretty fast but i have to change the cartridges every 3 4 weeks this is just home use i'm talking about , not business use
i bought this printer because i wanted high quality photo printing and i did n't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers it 's a canon , so i figured i could count on the photo quality i was terribly disappointed though i generally buy staples brand photo paper for general photo printing , and it always worked fine with my epson printer but my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy like i was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey brown haze so i went out and bought canon paper instead the quality was somewhat improved , but still not what i had expected so yes , i got a printer for under 30 , but now to get even passably ok prints , i need to spend a fortune on canon brand inks and paper not much of a bargain
as best as i can tell the wires were too thin , and it could not handle any kind of bandwidth
i installed the board and my pc \( running xp pro \) wo n't boot i tested all the pci slots with other cards \( and mixed them up too \) and the pc boots fine i returned the card and got a new one same problem i removed all of my other pci cards and left this one in there alone same problem i'm speechless i guess it 's not compatable with some systems by the way , i know my set up is fine i have 3 pci slots filled and 3 additional usb devices and all is well i never had a problem like this before
this adapter will not work at all with windows xp sp2 despite any promises from the linksys website , this cannot be setup buy the anycom adapter instead
i have spent time with lynksys and dell , both of which say they have done all they can do , \( from their manuals \) because i have had to finish phone calls without without solving the problem , i call back and get conflicting oppinions this keeps me coming back it still is not working , they have that in common
their quality is cheap so do their price out of the 25 cds , atleast 8 of them failed the rest , okay i would suggest verbatim they are pretty good
pros
i bought this product from kb electronics
i bought this player a little over a year ago , mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to region free played everything i put in it until a few days ago , when it started having intermittent problems graphics were staticy and blocky , sound would just buzz and it would n't eject discs until i shut it down and restarted it that lasted for two days before the problem became permanent now it 's a doorstop the apex web site appears to be down right now , but based on the other reviews here i doubt there 's much point in contacting them
the resaon i purchased this sport case is because it was an apple product my thoughts were that is i was going to dive into the ipod experience i should invest in a quality case to protect it i'm sure that most people would think the way i do i read the reviews and felt that even though it was a little pricey i would go ahead this product is not a good one for the price mine broke , specifically , the plastic slider on the side that locks the shuffle in i know what your thinking she abused the product but i swear i did not i loathe returning things but , darn it , this is ridiculous avoid this one and go for something less expensive
though the concept is great , and the controls are straight forward and easy to use , the belkin reader falls short of usability
arrived today in a taped , ripped , and open box it appears as though all the parts are there , but this is definitely not a 'factory sealed' product beware !
this product came with an italian users guide in addition the specification fails to state the thickness of this wall mount it turns out its about 3 5 inches thick and with the thickness of the monitor itself it stands out very far from the wall
hard to figure out and organize music battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often do n't recommend it very not happy
i adore my nano , but this armband is one of the worst products i have ever bought i work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout the spacing of the velcro dots means i never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime i do weight lifting close to my body it is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is i am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage
either i am idiot or this product is very poorly designed ! it takes forever to get it just right , so that it wo n't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right now they have them in sorts of colors , do n't buy it , you 'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it , like me
i bought the armband when i got my mini ipod however , the belt clip that comes with the ipod is perfect to clip to my shorts while jogging you do n't need this large , clunky armband
i found the armband to be uncomfortable and inconvenient i think the upper arm is just a bad place to carry an ipod the added weight is distracting when i'm running even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all , so lifting weights is out put it on too tight , and i constrict the muscle loosen it a little , and the band slips off there is no happy medium also , the earphone cord gets in the way more when it 's leading from my arm
do not waste your money on this product ! ! whilst amazon has a very good price for it , the headset is junk ! i tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum the hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines it could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible i work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes this set is very poor quality and not worth the money
amazon quickly shipped this item to me and i was ready to rock 'n' roll until i plugged it in there was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear the buzzing noise stopped when i hit mute , so the plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem amazon was very gracious about their return policy and i was quickly sent a new phone free of charge well , the second phone does the same thing and i'm returning it to get a refund maybe just my phone line \? possibly but i 've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both
bought c01u and was glad i could send it back after a testing period
the card lasted about 3 months then just died i'm disappointed considering the cost when it was working it seemed to have better range than my builtin centrino web access card i do n't know if i got a lemon but now i have to check the warranty
the card worked really well except for one little thing there is no way to enbale super g mode \( you need it to connect at 108mbps \) without the most i could connect at was 54mbps the quick install guide and the manual said it 's available , but it was n't tech support was able to reproduce my problem , and tried many , many things even though they were very helpful , they coudl n't fix it
like another reviewer , i had the srf h3 model , and loved them comfortable , secure , decent sound , and almost indestructable
i ca n't say enough positive about logitech mice this device , however , was a dismal disappointment the pc interface works well , and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive unfortunately , that in no way translates into a good remote interface the ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor , and , for those with video recorder boxes , very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available \( if its there at all , its hidden many keystrokes deeper than i care to know about \) even when reverting to manual operation of individual components , changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes \( as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes a much more irritating trait than one might think \) overall , for day to day functionality i actually consider the barely programmable remote that came with my scientific atlanta dvr vastly superior to the harmony , which i 've given up on after only a few days of forced use
i have 2 10 year old natural keyboards with the old keyboard layout and when i saw this new keyboard with the same layout i bought one sadly , this keyboard is painful to use the keys especially the space bar require far more force to use that my previous keyboard i am a software engineer and used to typing but this keyboard has slowed my typing rate and wears me out after 20 minutes on the shelf it goes for emergencies as i 'll continue to maintain my old keyboard
used this unit for a few weeks and returned
confusing light display \( looking in the manual \) told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages there is no jam there is nothing stuck in the printer sending it back now i do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages \( maybe you wo n't have time either ! \) i am very tech savvy and have checked the manual the device simply is defective
the description indicates that it works on mac platform
these are some great headphones , buy them from somewhere else ! i chose to buy them here because of the lower price , big mistake , what i recieved wase n't the item picutered i do n't know if there an older version or some knock offs , the sound is ok but there very cheaply made and theres something wrong with the hinges they do n't fold properly i have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break returned them and spent the extra 20 bucks to buy them from the actual site
worked well when it was working massive bass response , comfortable cushioning for big ears and funky styling only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction however , none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase gave absolutely no signs before hand , just working one day , completely dead the next there are other reviewers here that shared my same fate , so if you want to gamble with these , go ahead , but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones
low volume people can not hear me at the other end i therefore have to return it
one of the two ends was broken
this version released late 2005 is obviously a cost cutting result this release drops the zipper which is essential when travelling also the price have doubled compared to the previous style
this is my second one of these \( i pinched off the cable on my first one with a storage console door and had to get another ! \)
a 150 calculator that i am going to trash i had the same problem with the keyboard \( terrible response \) i struggled with it for about a year and then called hp my warranty was out , so hp suggested i install an update , which i did now the keys are firing off 3 or 4 digits with one press of the button this is ridiculous
i am an rpn devotee and have owned two other hps going back to the original 11c but this calculator is horribly unreliable because it seems to ignore key entries occasionally \( although you hear and feel the click , nothing happens \) also , the keys themselves may bust loose and start to wobble even after little use this is my third replacement in the last two years be sure and save your receipt because quality control is absent on this one
this was my first set of in ear headphones and i bought them because they are cheap well , you get what you pay for being disappointed with the fit of the koss phones , i bought the slightly more expensive jvc ha fx55v at least for me , a much better fit , which means more comfort and better sound and i am still shopping the array of offerings is daunting jvc and jplug at about 20 all the way up to shure 's top of the line at 500 so shop around , but forget about the koss
this warranty is purchased through amazon , but it is actually distributed by another company when you search for tv warranties on amazon , you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same , but are different prices i called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was they told me that there is no difference between the 119 warranty and the 499 warranty they cover the exact same thing the girl i spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference warranties are a tricky item to review , because it all looks good until you actually need it so , on this one , i suppose only time will tell the one difference between the amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the tv but i figure if i need to replace the bulb within those four years i will still be saving 100 because i can get a new bulb for around 200
bought this as a back up for the internal hard drive of the laptop my experience was sadly similar to many others on this site worked fine for two backups , then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer little red power light is on , little disc whirls around , but no blue data transmit light appears anymore these are clearly a dismally unreliable and poorly made product just imagine the disaster if this occurred when you were trying to restore data to a corrupted hard drive on your primary machine a free replacement would not be much of a compensation avoid ! !
buy the empty player for 37 , then get a 128 mb card its only 5 bucks mopre total
the ipod is cool but ours as we 've found has happened to many other owners went on the fritz and our nightmare began apple 's customer service is the worst cs that we 've ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported i could write for days about the awful experience but i 've wasted so much time with them already i ca n't bear to waste more the most notable point is that the ipod cs folks repeatedly stated that ipods are more or less disposable , commodity items and breakdowns were common wow ! ! 400 bucks of throw away ! \? ! \? ! \? we still have n't recieved the return box for replacement repair after several days even though it was promised in 24 48 hours we also own an mp3 player that we refer to as a dell pod from dell computer and have had to use their customer service as well dell 's cs support was awesome based on our experience with apple ipod cs support this is the first and last apple product that will be owned in our household
i purchased this item on nov 17 , 2006 amazon claimed it was in stock i then upgraded from free shipping to standard , which promises a 3 5 days delivery time amazon now informs me that it will arrived on nov 29th ! this is the second recent order with a longer than anticipated promised delivery time i do n't know if amazon is going down hill or what , but it 's discouraging next time , i 'll just buy the item locally and pay a few extra dollars and by the way , do n't even try to call amazon customer service at 800 201 7575 they ca n't do anything to resolve a problem and barely speak or understand english another great american company moving towards metiocracy what a shame
short answer the microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume , and cannot be adjusted independently either through the device or at the o s level
compared this cable to a philips performance component cable and i am not impressed it was the exact same in picture quality
i was fairly satisfied with this phone until i had to re arrange my office and move my phone once i moved it and then tried to reconnect it , i no longer had lcd functionality or speakerphone functionality
i did n't have the same experience as the great support from lexar review below
everyone knows terk makes junk , and this multiswitch is no exception i needed a multiswitch quick , went to best buy and paid , get this , 154 00 for this terk ms ! ! yeah , i know , but i needed it asap one week after installation , one of the satellite inputs crapped out , dead and i do have surge protection on the lines also , the unit runs very hot i 've had three other terk products do the same thing avoid terk at all costs and go with monster or even radio shack in a pinch will never buy a terk product again ever
the item i bought had to be returned due to the fact it did not wor
yes , i burned them in for at least 25 hours they sounded muddy smooth as caramel , but veiled the bass was heavy and indistinct the high frequencies were not clean , and not abundant
small button size
will not charge the micro zen , but will power the unit will toss it in the car for those times when the battery is dead and i just need my music
it is rather ironic that this device was so cheap that despite the fact that it will not charge an ipod shuffle it cost more to ship it back than i would get in a refund
while this device does power your usb cable it seems to fail charging my blackberry or my ipod maybe the 400 ma is not enough for that i would not suggest to buy this item for these devices for the ipod you better get the usb charger from the apple store for 25 that even comes with a standard ipod cable
i recently received an ipod photo and after loading in tons of cd 's i said hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car my transpod arrived but i had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car 's charger after working that out and using it everyday for a week , it stopped working i realized that the fuse had blown it 's small and relatively compact unlike the griffin roadtrip , but it 's a whole lot of drama for the price
my first mouse broke after only a few uses when i sent it back for repairs , they sent back a refurbished mouse that did not work at all avoid buying this mouse at all costs
when it works , this mouse is simply wonderful small , accurate , easy to recharge , easy to carry under those conditions , it 's probably my favorite mouse i 've found that it 's equally good for both mac and windows
what a waste of money for 300 you should n't have to buy a protection plan for the 2nd year of a products life unfortunately the poor quality of ipods makes it a necessity but , the protection plan is riddled with clauses that exclude any number of reasonable issues
although this policy is thru apple , it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations one is crutchfield com which has a 2 yr plan for 29 99 which starts after the standard apple 1 yr labor coverage \( for a total of 3 years \) apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for 59 99 , rather than a total of 3 years for 29 99 thru crutchfield
after receiving this boon mic , i found it did not work consitently losing contact with lost words , and the mic had to be held to the lips , therefore it was not truly hands free i require a mic that i do not have to touch to work and can be used with vo
i received the camera and was not happy when i found a cheap mic that was attached to the cord of an ear peace instead of the the superior sound mic advertised in the ad i called amazon , they had no appolgies and said the most they could do was refund my money
the z 5450 has good points , reasonable cost , ease of use and ease of setup it has a major fault in a buzzing noise made when the unit is turned on give this item a pass , wait for the next generation and a guarantee that this problem has been corrected
this thing looks great but it still has tracking problems as these cheap units tend to do yourself a favor and buy the cyber home it 's the only cheaper unit that seems to have some quality to it
i searched amazon com for a multi region dvd player so i could view dvds that i have purchased overseas this dvd player came up there are no instructions within the packaging that state how to watch non region 1 dvds i called the manufacturer and they told me how to rigg it to play region 2 dvds also , the remote control did not work from the very beginning and the manufacturer said i would need to pay money to replace it they also let me know that the dvd player will not work without the remote control \( not compatible with universal remotes \) this is not a good product
maybe 2 1 2 stars
this charger is flimsy 1 \) as other mention , the retractable unit quickly became tangled , and without significant attention every single time \( not feasible while driving \) , does n't retract 2 \) the plastic covering the wire at the base of the jack pulled loose , exposing the wires 3 \) after a few months of very gentle use , the white plastic cover of the jack cracked and fell off as a result , i'm back in the market for a charger , just months after buying this one
i tried them on a sony dcr trv33 , and they clogged my heads in about 10min of recording
after purchasing my canon zr 90 this summer , and using the four pack of tdk tapes abc warehouse gave me with the camcorder , i went online and found these tapes and bought two ten packs due to the great price and the jvc name
it worked okay for about a month and then froze up one day when i was running i popped out the battery so it would turn off and when i turned it back on it had deleted all of the songs
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead , the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me 340 00 and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
the features , size , and design of this unit are what drew me in but after just a few uses , i quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive , but completely unusable package to start with , the unit is small the smallest of its kind but the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace second , the unit has a built in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed so , when it crashes , which it does frequently , there is no way to cold boot the unit by removing the battery this is also a problem because it reduces the unit 's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no ac power to recharge it then , what you have is a paperweight oh , and by the way , when you do have it plugged in to charge , the backlight is always on \( even if the power is off \) so forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either
the microtrack will not hold a charge by itself or even operate very long when hooked up to an external usb battery pack it just drains away under charge the concept for this a pretty good , but the implementation woefully lacking almost to the point where i may not reliably recommend to others
i bought this product twice now i have two of them and none works this router is not able to get itself an ip from the cable modem let alone sending out a wireless signal first time i thought the router was defective and i ordered a new one hoping to return the first one , received the second one before i could return the first one , and the new one was no better than the other anyways avoid this product at all costs , or else
run winxp , sp2 with everything updated i 've had this router for 6 months it is the wgt624v3 , firmware updated i never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone , while reading the amazon com reviews
caution creative used to have great support now , 60 days of phone support i have a 9 month old zen micro it will not start , if i plug it in , it appears to charge but never completes , if i turn it on while plugged in i get to the creative boot up screen , it goes blank and never completes the boot up useless junk now i cnnot find my original receipt , \( who can \) i cannot be returned , and i cannot get support on it
i wanted to connect a computer to a router , and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router so i figured i needed a long cord , and decided to get this one , which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch \( which was what i needed \) well , it 's long that 's the only good thing about this cord but the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless there is nothing on the ends ! it 's just a giant wire ! there are n't any connectors on the ends that i can use to plug the cord into my computer , or the router so i have a cord , but no connectors it 's completely useless , unless i buy the connectors separately , and attach them myself do i know how to do that \? do i want to do that \? no so i'm returning this maybe , if all you need is the cord \( it 's grey , by the way \) , and not the connectors , you might be able to use this otherwise , it 's completely useless if you ca n't find any cords this long that have connectors , maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
i have really enjoyed my i pod until i started to get errors in january 2006 i started to get an error that state that itunes ca n't read to or write form the disk meaning the ipod itself that means i cannot add music to or take music off of the iopd this was very upsetting to me as i have had this item for less than a year i finlay called tech support at apple they asked for the serial for my ipod they told me it was out of warranty , that the warranty had expired in december of 2005 and there was nothing i could do , literally i checked my purchase and found out that i had purchased this on april 7 , 2005 i was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not so , this is a warning to all ipod owners of this potential problem
dont buy and i had tough time in adjusting the ear piece as it falls out every time you hang it over the ear
we signed up with vonage a couple of months ago setting up the d link adapter was a snap and i had a dial tone quickly after several days , my line was ported and i thought everthing was ok
these were expensive
these were not recognizable by my sony dual layer burner maybe with more attempts and practice they will be
my wife bought this as a gift for me , thinking that it included an fm tuner for ten dollars more , she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does \( it is essentially a 35 car charger \) plus the tuner if you want to use this product to actually listen to your ipod in your car , you 'll need to purchase yet another device either the cassette adapter \( old school ! part f8v366 apl \) or the fm transmitter \( part f8v367 apl \) either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit the fm transmitter is another 40 \( you 're now 20 30 over what the monster icarplay , which does all of the above , would have cost you \) and , surprise ! the transmitter takes aaa batteries ! there 's no way to power the transmitter through the auto kit to power the fm transmitter without batteries , you must purchase yet a third accessory , the mobile power cord for ipod \( f8v7067 apl , just 15 ! \) except your car 's power plug is occupied by the auto kit , so you 'll need to buy a twin plug adapter for that
i am the owner of a home day care and i had all of the kids bring in t shirts so that we could all create our own unique father 's day gifts with these iron on transfers when i say that i followed the directions precisely i am not fooling ! i was so concerned about slip ups that i made sure i followed the directions to the letter , but every time i tried to pull off the cooled transfer paper off came half of the design and the rest styed on the paper ! very disappointing
very bad start , bad point for amazon i wanted to get a good quality device and that is the reason i chose buying from amazon even it was more expensive than other sites
yeah , the nano dock is useful however , be aware that it comes with no cords whatsoever this means that you have to purchase yet another accessory for it to be of any practical use boo apple ! there is absolutely no excuse for following in the footsteps of microsoft
just got this camera in the mail as a birthday present installing the software was easy , but unfortunately the camera is essentially broken it is only \( somewhat \) in focus for items about 1 inch away adjusting the focus ring does n't help , so this camera 's build seems to be defective my brother bought the same camera and it does n't seem to have the same problem anyway , returning mine
i had a d link usb adaptor before which was really good , but was old i upgraded to a wireless g linksys usb adaptor , but i was supplied with old goods \( a linksys sales manager confirmed that \) , so i sent that back i thought i 'd try d link again bad move first , i tried to upgrade the drivers my current version was 1 0 5 0 i downloaded the version 1 12 from d link 's site after uninstalling and reinstalling \( several times \) i still had 1 0 5 0 an hour and a half on the phone with d link tech support and i still had 1 0 5 0 another hour on google , and i'm not the only one with this issue seems to be a version control issue with d link then , even more irritating , every time after i use my wired connection and go back to wireless i have to reinstall the drivers and reboot and re enter all my security info again \( i believe this has something to do with using a different usb port from the last time , but whatever the reason , it 's unacceptable \) this adaptor 's going back too do n't know what i 'll try next
the long cord simply did n't work i returned it to maxell , using the address on the back of the package , and had the product returned to me because the facility has closed i 've spent almost 5 trying to return an 8 product
these discs are not really tdk they are low quality discs branded and priced as tdk
sucks i had this right form the start with my compaq 7970 which is amd k7 processor and has the via chipset the computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when i first used it but i guess that was when i had windows 98 for 2 years when i upgraded to windows xp it just got terrible i had frequent blue screens and errors i thought it was my video card or my ram or irq sharing tried all that did n't seem to be it eventually i was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem the card was the problem buy another card other than fa310 , fa311 the one i have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else i would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road i have tried updates from and updating my ram and video card have checked my irqs and reformating hard drive none worked i put in a 3 com card i bought a few years before this computer and wow no crashes that other computer is now wirelessly connected to my home network
please ! for the love of god ! do not buy this product ! it is absolutly horrible i 'll admit that since i bought my computer and go this card back in 2002 , i had n't had problems until the past few months i play an online game a mmorpg and after every time the game is updated and i have to install the updates i am unable to log onto the game ! it freezes up , and either makes my computer crash or destroys my internet connections , forcing me to restart as you can imagine , this gets rather frustrating , and if you play mmorpgs , you can see how it is even more frustrating i am currently running xp home edition i beg you , do not buy this ethernet card just because it is the cheapest one out there ! you get what you pay for ! now i'm off to buy a new one
the photo on the target website shows a cable input output for cable protection the unit arrived with a phone line input output not much help for those expecting protection on their cable line
i have a g4 tower mac that did have a built in ethernet unfortunately , a lightening strike took out the port and i was forced to get a pci card to replace the port the first card i bought was the d link dfe 530tx i was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with macs and that the minimum requirement was os 10 2
i started out with 2 gigabytes and then after i had filled this card with about 500 photos , i downloaded all the photos to my computer after deleting all of the photos from this card , the capacity had suddenly decreased to only half ! what happened to the other 1 gigabyte \? i'm sure they pre formatted this card to appear like it 's 2 gigabytes , but what a surprise when you start using it not good
i canceled the order of velocity dvd r disks since it took too long to deliver
these radios look nice but there are some problems here first the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands the receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times i also hace a t7200 and the difference is like night and day the 7200 is the best the 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low i paid 24 00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for 44 00 today what good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying \? good try motorola but this is a poor product not recommended to purchase
i ordered this radio back in may and i still do n't have them it is now september i have exchanged several emails with amazon , the first one i received a very nice but untrue reply the second response was borderline rude but at least honest , they told me that they do n't have the product and do n't know when they will if you are looking for something to use now , do n't waste your time with ordering this radio
the box says you can either power or charge your ipod with the powerjolt to me , power means listening to the ipod while it is plugged in to the powerjolt however , there is an overwhelming amount of buzz and static when the ipod is playing while connected to the powerjolt maybe this thing works ok to charge while the ipod is not playing , but it is not an acceptable way to power the ipod while it is playing
i commute via public transportation , the majority of that on a noisy train earbuds and over ear headphones do n't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music i received these philips hn110 headphones as a gift
after only having the cable for a week under very light usage , the cable stopped working intermittently it makes crackling noises when the cable is moved i am not talking about whipping or quick movement , just gentle movement of the cable causes crackling and loss of signal i was about to scrap the cable altogether but i decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help i cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it , only to find that the same problem persisted i got a bad cable , obviously
the im3c was a gift looked like a great little portable stereo for my pod first used it on a trip started off playing ok and then the sound cut in and out frustrated me for the week as i did n't know if it would play or not on any given day when it did play it was ok but not great finally , it did n't play anymore
bought a cell phone battery that , of course , died one week past their return refund deadline refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again consider yourself warned
i bought the tdk mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago it worked wonderfully for the first year did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great then i upgraded to windows xp and that 's when everything started going wrong this mp3 player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or cd to the mp3 player unfortunately the software does n't work well at all with xp right now , my player is piece of junk i have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player , they do n't show up on there what 's more , formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so i have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free however , it wo n't copy over any new files and gives me a storage full error it does n't act reliably with xp either and i had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the mp3 it lasted all of 15 months while it sounds like a great deal \( good features for price \) do not buy this if you will be using it with xp and if you do , please do n't expect it to last more than 12 15 months
this player is a piece of junk
does the unit work \? \? , well yes to a degree it takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances the display is poor and though they say up to 40 objects per hole there is normally 2 4 objects per hole all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder the user \( you \) can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder did n't think was important
you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel \? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen free , gold tipped , multi sheilded , super mega supreme cables if you do n't believe me , buy this cable and a no name cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference
have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you an arm and a leg \? these cables cost that , your first son , and bidding rights to your estate do n't get me wrong monster makes great cables let there be no confusion on this point but they 're just incredibly expensive , and this is made much worse with these cables
what do they say about fools and money \?
if you ca n't abide an ever present low hiss in the background , and louder interference in the presence of power lines , do n't buy this product i wish i 'd read the reviews more carefully before i bought a number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance
i think this product design concept is great i love the flexibe arm size it fits great in my car the crappy part i live near metro st louis and i could not hold a signal anywhere ! i always had some intereference whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out this product did not meet my expectations , especially since the back of the package states i should have crystal clear sound this is not true i have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase i am now waiting to get my dlo transpod 2 in the mail to try it out i want something to work !
i have to say , since i really started listening to music i have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound with that said i am not a bass junky but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound i currently owned a pair of sony mdr ex81lp \( that cost me 30 40 dollars a year ago \) i am a medical student and i study all day and all night , but cannot have my music blasting conversely i needed to have a nice isolation of my sound comparing my old sony to the new er 6 that i just got , i am extremely dissapointed with their performance i was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that i studied with my old ear buds to be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling , they are noise reducing there is no component involved here , they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them my wife just ran the vacuum and i barely heard it the earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable however my other ones \( sony earbuds \) sound better a combination of the two would be great keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds environmental sound reduction is great , sound quality is not as good as some others choose your fault and pay attention to pricing
i was disappointed with these earphones the sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated the 30 sony mdr ex51 earphones i already owned sounded much better
i have had the 325 model for less than a year up until recently i was satisfied with its performance using it to print less than 5 pictures at a time recently , i needed to print a series of pictures \( more than 10 in one sitting \) and had an error message print cartridge jam i fixed the paper jam but continued to get the error message i called hp and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer i searched the internet for a solution only to find that others had encountered this and the solution was to purchase the new'model a not very cost effective solution as this was not supposted to be a disposable model
don't buy these things ! they go bad and sandisk won't replace them buy ocz or a data or something these things are very unreliable
i bought the sony 128 mb memory stick \( msh 128 \) a few months ago , but i only used it once when i was in my 20th picture , an error appeared in the screen of my sony p100 camera
a friend gave me this card for free , when i travled to arizona i use this card in my dell x51v
i bought this sd card on april 11 unfortunately , the card does n't work properly , in fact , my camera and my computer never detect it
i purchased the 1gb lexar card , and 5 hours after i started using it , i 've got corrupted data that no amount of formating or data deletion will remedy given that i had already disceted the box into small pieces to send in for mail in rebates , i contacted lexar and sent it to them on a warrenty claim cheaper then driving back to the retail location i purchased it at anyway
i bought a brand new unit directly from garmin it worked for about a week , then it would no longer charge i returned it and got a refurbished unit in exchange
i had bought this item due to good review before i went to a trip to bulgaria however , it plugs in but does n't work why \? i do n't know how should i deal with it now \? is it a defect one \? i have no idea , to me i just lost 17 dollars for an experience \( do n't buy electronic items from a book store , even it 's cheaper \) fortunate i also bought targus travel adaptor set that save me
if you have a 30 gig video ipod , mabey but for a 60 gig it is too tight to it , got a mark on ipod after taking it out , covered up part of the screen on mine , and i'm taking it back right away
please , do not buy or use this product the hand stitched , supple leather scratched my new 60g black ipod video the description says it will fit all ipod videos but mine was very tight so far , dlo has not answered my complaints neither has apple i bought the speck toughskin \( have not received it yet \) and hope it helps me heal the pain bad product
it was horrible , soon as i plug the speakers in it was making a constant noise , really annoying , the speakers were junk , worst purchase i 've ever made from amazon i would 've returned them but i did n't want to go through the trouble of sending it back so i just smashed them and went to best buy and got new ones i know it was a cheap speaker , but hell it should atleast work properly talk about trash
these speakers are unusable they give off horrible feedback even when there 's not a cell phone or cordless phone in the room
this machine is great looking , compact , and seems to be the perfect combination fax answering machine speakerphone one major problem the phone is well below average in sound quality , and the speaker is absolutely terrible the tiny , poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion the fax is great , the print quality is great , the speed is great , but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker to hear messages this problem also renders the speakerphone useless i returned this unit twice thinking it was defective , but spoke to hp and was told that is just the way this unit works buy the panasonic kx fhd351 if you need a great sounding unit the only problem with the panasonic is that it does n't come in black , but is a much better phone answering speakerphone
i bought it for my c340 but it does not work with it maybe it was my fault for not reading the description in depth i really thought it did say it is good for street pilots , though there might not be anything wrong with the item but it needs a better technical description
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now , it only retracts about half way , and keeps getting worse i'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this
i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall i thought the first one was a defect , but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it what i do n't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it satisfaction guaranteed what a joke
this card is on its way back to amazon i purchased it as it was one of the recommended items with the camera i also purchased , never mind that it does n't work with the camera i'm not hugely tech savvy i \( wrongly \) assumed that any items recommended with the main item \( a 500 camera \) would be compatible check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to
this is n't the type of behavior i would expect from such a valuable and big company as amazon is they cancelled my order same way as the other people 's they did n't even send any notification email and i found my order cancelled by looking at the site amazon must learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed , if they made a mistake pricing the item is their problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone if amazon do n't ship the orders already placed they will throw stones over their own roof and make lots of bad publicity i'm one of many who wo n't be buying anything ever if amazon do n't send me my ordered items count with me for any legal actions that may be taken
i bought these because i have an hp printer and figured they would be best for the shirts i want to make i could n't get them to take for anything in the world i put the pressure on it , ironed them longer , everything you can think of and they still would n't take then when i finally got one to take it completely cracked and crumbled and started peeling off before an hour was up it never made it to the wash , so now i am out the money i paid for them and still have no shirts any other brands you suggest instead
it 's the most expensive cf card with absolutely no customer support after a while the cf card stopped working no power light as if the card burned out i really ca n't tell you exactly what went wrong because it 's impossible to contact someone at socket customer support i followed their web site instructions but was never contacted i 'll never buy another socket product again
connects to your microsoft pocket pc and will not work with a palm if you mistakenly order , amazon com will not refund your shipping have a nice day
it states in the technical details that you can get 450 pictures from this cartridge this is not true after much discussion with hp , they finally admitted that it 's only rated for 150 4 x 6 pictures my experience is that you actually get a little under 100 pictures from it if you 're buying this cartridge , you 've probably already bought the printer , but you should know before you buy the printer that you 're going to go through a lot of expensive ink
i put this item in my cart it was one of the buy both now deals the problem is , the first item was sold by amazon , with free shipping , the second item was sold by another company with outrageous shipping costs
i love the functionality of this armband the problem is that it keeps breaking the place at which the band loops through the holder keeps breaking i'm on my second one and it is almost ready for another replacement
this lexar brand has had issues with it 's memory cards i lost lots of pictures from a vacation to disney world and a convention their site had software that was to help recover some of those lost images ! ! i have never had flash memory trouble until lexar ! i now only buy scandisk items samsung invented this tecnology and sd is their product the store i bought the lexar chip was in a hurry to give me another chip i could trust he gave me the higher costing sd chip i was n't the first to have issues from buying it in his store he took a 50 00 loss to make me happy people take lots of photos now that we went digital imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there ! most think they messed up with this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention most of what is lost can not be recovered pay the extra money for scandisk
the remote control is ok
a short review
i am sorry to say that my experience with the cd player has been miserable after a series of unhelpful conversations with sony folks , i am going to return it it often fails to read the cd or cuts in and out on new cds that play perfectly in other cd players the shuffle program simply spins and spins , and rarely settles down to actually play a cd it occasionally generates a read error message \( uh , yeah \)
i mainly chose this mouse because i needed one quickly and it was black and matched my set up i had been using the standard greyish white optical mouse with a scroll wheel and a red light that shined out from under my wrist this one feels smaller , but still comfortable however a couple weeks of normal usage made the mouse much less solid feeling the plastic now mushes as the seems flex slightly in my hand i decided to have a friend repair the cable of my old mouse i am going to donate this mouse to a friend who still has a tracking ball mouse i like some of logitechs products and higher end mice but i would stay away from this mouse its not bad , its just not good enough to pick over other mice that cost the same amount
i first isntalled this to winxp 2nd ed and all of a sudden i am getting blue screens and the system keeps rebooting over and over i uninstall and the problem goes away coincidence \? i will let you decide i reinstalled the adaptor and it gets very very hot reminds me of my notebook that overheats and shuts down i cant get a connection to my router i have my notebook im typing on now connected right next to the adaptor desktop and get a signal just fine with my notebook i will be sending this back
ok i take my words back i found a solution to the connection problem with windows xp download a patch \( windowsxp kb884020 x86 enu exe , solving wpa issues \) from microsoft , then everything goes as it should be
it dies if you plug in any external usb disk drive or card reader d link just does n't know how to write device drivers that work well i 've had problems with every d link product i 've ever bought
when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between 1000 and 1499 99
i never received the 4 year plan , when i purchased the tvhd in august 2006 i have wrote to amazon several times with no follow up by amozon
if you do , go ahead and take a chance i did and got burned tv did n't work right out of the box will return soon
unfortunately i bought this router \( aka junk \) from amazon never worked smoothly did not like wpa after i set the the protocol to wpa and restarted it , the router froze updated firmware , no use now its not working power is intermittent , will shut off whenever it wants freezes randomly this garbage is going back to dlink today dlink tech support also said that they are having a huge number of complaints with 524 especially revision d
this may be one of the cheapest routers out there , but it 's cheap in every way i spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas tech support whose expertise consisted of \( barely \) reading a script eventually these computer whizzes determined that my d link router did n't work they told me to send it back \( on my nickel , of course \) , and they sent me another one , which also did not work , at least not with my computer system after more wasted hours , i was referred to the one guy at d link who supposedly has mastered this router 's bugs the problem \? he never answered the phone and despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk , he repeatedly returned my calls at 3 00 in the afternoon , the time when most people who can afford routers are working finally i had an epiphany life was too short to with d link i packed up the router and sent it back to the ceo , stephen joe , with a letter then i went out and bought a netgear router , and i was up and running in minutes mr joe never responded to my letter , but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly does n't value its customers
have had this router for over a year during this time the router constantly lost the internet connection , even when it 's wired directly to my desktop pc the disconnect can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to minutes a new firmware \( 1 23 \) was released a few days ago for revision a \( the version of the router i have \) d link 's website said the firmware improved reliability so i decided to upgrade after flashing to the new firmware , the router will not let me into the control panel or respond to pings the lights blink , that 's all i 've reset the router , but this does nothing to restore the old firmware d link 's firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company
i bought 2 pairs of this radios and 1 of the pairs have a damage radio , the microphone dose n't work and i cant fix it ! ! \(
a while ago i purchased the same item , maybe a month , and i received what i paid for 2 walkie talkies , 2 rechargable batteries , and a charging base for the walkies
bike did not run right from the beginning the battery did not stay charged after awhile just quite running altogether company was not very usefull warranty only 90 days do not buy this peice of junk
i spoke with customer service rep at 800 283 1311 devices have a one year warranty i stated that i sent in the registration card , and asked if she would look up the purchase date she said no , registration and warrany are in different departments
i purchased two cdos only to find out that some of the lights on one of them did not work after 6 weeks , kds finally replaced it it did not cost me anything but time and frustration after 2 months , my second one has now failed most of the trays do not eject it is no longer returnable and i have cds stuck in it do not make the mistake of purchasing even one of these go to k mart and get one of the old fashioned manual ones you will be much happier
adorama is a terrible company to deal with they sent me a pkg of 2 epson ink cartridges and 270 papers i have called several times as the ink cartridges were not the correct ones i returned them as instructed , written 3 letters and called this started in mid july i called 2 weeks ago \( aug 28th and a different gal said she thought i should have my money back and would see to it that was over 2 weeks ago and nothing since then
i bought this unit to use with a boombox and it functioned well but after a few minutes it just went blank i tried batteries in the boombox , ac power and two boomboxes because they thought the boombox was the problem
this review is more about my several month 's experience with xm satellite radio and the not so good quality using the wireless fm frequencies through our car 's radios i live in los angeles
purchased the transmitter for my mp3 player reception is poor with constant static through my car radio the instructions \( which you do n't see until you have already purchased the product \) says antennas integrated into the window can have problems since that is the only purpose for this device , i do n't understand why monster is selling a marginal product
i 've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now the last few times i 've taken them out for vacation use in camera , i 've had the same problem i charge two sets \( one kodak and one these energizers \) when i put the camera away a few weeks later , i go off on vacation the kodak 1600mah set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before the energizer 2500mah set might last me half a day , having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use
i got these batteries just over a few months ago for my portable gps unit that i use often on my travels in fact , i bought eight of them \( two packs of 4 \) i was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mah rayovac nimh aa batteries that were still going strong after 2 years when i saw the new energizer 2500mah rechargeables i was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mah rayovacs boy was i wrong !
i bought several packs of these batteries 6 months ago they were great at first , but now most of them wo n't hold a charge at all they discharge in 2 weeks without even being in a device don't buy them ! they 're junk
i had such high hopes for these headphones i wanted to hook them over my ears and go running whenever i pleased but it was not to be
you would think that panasonic cordless phone and panasonic hands free headset would work well together , being that they are sold by the same company well , that is clearly not the case i bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by panasonic to work with their cordless phones i 've tried it a few times and each time i get the same response from the person i'm talking to they say i sound too far away , that they can barely hear me this product is clearly not worth it
i like the hp 96 because it can be used in many hp printers that use the hp 98 , but its a better deal than the hp 98 because it contains almost twice as much ink
looks beautifull works about 40 of the time be ready to reinstall the software weekly
terrible product i have tried using the windows xp wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers using either one the card disconnects at random using wpa , then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back i reinstalled windows both times i changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it , but nothing helped latest drivers are 2 0 0 7 and were published in nov 2004 , so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer
these are extremely uncomfortable it 's too tight and will hurt the ears however , if you 're head is small enough , perhaps it might be okay on the bright side , they sound extremely well
do not get these headphones , as they are way too tight i have been using them for a month now , hoping they would break in more , but they have not you can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them im not sure why they made them so tight , but they would probably best fit a 10 year old
i bought the zboard and was sorely disappointed in it 's playbility , efficiency and value for several reasons
i picked these speakers up because the price was right and they sounded great in the store but i get them home to my quiet house and lo and behold the subwoofer constantly hums i'm not an audiophile and therefore not overly particular about sound other than this annoying hum from the subwoofer since these are set up in my home office where i spend a lot of time reading , i find this humming far too distracting although the price is good , i 'd prefer to pay a little more just to omit the subwoofer 's constant hum
can not get this thing to connect to my linksys wireless router problem is not that it does n't see the linksys , the problem is that the v2 50 firmware in the wli tx4 g54hp is buggy if i try to enter a 10 digit hex key for 64 bit wep encryption it says i have to enter a 5 digit value this is the 2nd one i bought \( i returned the first \) piece of junk , and no support from the manufacturer
one star is too many ! \( it should be negative one \) this sad excuse for a television radio has to be the worst piece of lame crud i have ever bought in my entire life picture fades into black , terrible reception which fades in and out as you move about the room , smells like burning plastic after a half hour , and so on please , amazon shoppers , do n't waste any money on this ! you might just as well throw the 15 out the window step up to something more reliable from a better manufacturer
i love bringing my ipod to parties and broadcasting it through the stereo , what use is this thing then , none ! thanks for making us spend so much money apple this type of stuff should be built into the ipod for 400 ! !
i purchased this armband to hold my nano during workouts the band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training looking for a replacement right now
i adore my nano , but this armband is one of the worst products i have ever bought i work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout the spacing of the velcro dots means i never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime i do weight lifting close to my body it is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is i am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage
i have a dishnetwork 942 hdtv dvr system this antenna is designed for a much older system it does n't fit the dish very easily and was difficult to secure i ca n't tell if it works because so far it just seems to be incompatible with my system
do not be fooled when the description says this stand holds up to 21 monitors that is only true for flat panel monitors , not traditional crt monitors note that the weight rating says 50 pounds ! most standard 19 monitors weigh 60 pounds or more i purchased this item at a staples near me , and brought it home to use with my 19 crt after placing the monitor on the stand , the stand bobbed up and down and seemed as if it would completely bend at any moment
i ca n't understand how apple sell so much ipod video while they are so bad in front of an archos just look at the screen and you 'll understand !
amazon says that it is in stock
while certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the cds and the general labels , i found this product much less than satisfactory
i have used these labels for a long time , mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there the paperstock is good , but if you have a good printer the paper wo n't do it justice the labels always end up looking kinda cheap i would love to see memorex make a package with glossy paper high end paper maybe epson will beat them to it
i really love my garim gps 12 it is easy to use and move between screens and features the summit is not as easy to use it is not as convenient to identify way points , does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple it was not a step up but sideways i use it in conjunction with my gps 12 mostly just to keep the track log
i bought this monitor in june 2006 and at first was quite pleased with the nice display less than 6 months later , in november 2006 , i heard a strange noise while using the monitor and all of the sudden the screen went very bright like an overexposed photo i'm currently working with viewsonic to get it repaired \( i must mail it to ca to be repaired , postage must be paid by me \) all in all a disappointment and a hassle next time i 'll buy a name brand
i bought these cables , brought them home and immediatly hooked them up i set the ps2 for component and set my tv for it as well and it looked awesome for about 2 weeks then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy it would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the tv would have all the colors washed out in green
i logged 870 miles with the iway 350 270 miles around maryland it was is a great item i took it on our first trip to new york and long island and it was terrible the first problem occurred on the new jersey turnpike i was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat the unit said i was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway however when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more it said i was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70 , and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere i even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job it did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 miles from when it acted up we even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again about 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going we often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit then on the trip from the bronx to long island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating i had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone however about 1 mile from their place it started working again we used it on long island with no trouble at all then on trip back to the bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions then on our way back from the bronx to long island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating the same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the bronx on our way back to maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions i did update the software to the new 1 2 0 days before we took the trip
the 350c is well packaged with almost current programming it only got me lost eleven \( 11 \) times on a 865 mile trip all cities in georgia tybee island to pine mountain to newnan to stone mountain and return to tybee island \( i packed and returned the unit the day after getting home \) it may suit others well , but i can not rely on the unit four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences \( one wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way \) two were for unknown reasons the unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites instructions are clear , but preferred views automatically switch to map even when not wanted i need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination \( by a passanger , of course
i bought this unit on a wim i was leaving for a business trip and needed a gps i really like it and it worked well for me unfortunalty the unit would n't hold a charge on the battery so i returned it for another one it worked for one week and then i had the same exact problem which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units when i tried to return this unit , the unit i was given did n't work at all , it gave me an error message when the gps booted up unfortunaltey the vendor i purchased it from did n't have any more units that i could exchange it for so i called customer service and got an ran i am hoping when i get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that i do n't have any more problems
i received the ipod quickly which was a plus but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked i sent it back and requested a refund it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my 120 back
i bought this since it 's economical , compact , did n't need cabling \( although it has an extension if you need it \) , advertised a whopping 108 mbps well so much for that
all hdmi cables are created equal well , yes and no while the signal is 100 digital \( which means that 20 150 cables give the exact same picture quality \) , it does n't mean that each hdmi cable type gives the same rejection of noise \( signal to noise ratio \) as other hdmi cables
i bought magellan roadmate 700 vehicle gps 2 months back and its not working as expected its very poor in locating the the place and sometimes do n't even work many times this sytem got hung and power off and on again is the solution to get it work again
the dvd burner connected very easily through usb , was immediately recognized by winxp , the software installation was fine i was beginning to feel good however , whenever i burned a dvd \( i tried 4 different brands , some r , some rw etc \) , several files would contain errors , and would be completely unreadable the burning process moreover does not detect this one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors moreover , the firmware update just does not work on my machine , pardon , machines completely standard dell machines , all latest winxp and drivers , good cpus \( 3ghz and up \) , lots of memory , big hard drives i called customer service to try to solve the problem first of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes the rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing to make a long story short , i had to call 3 times first guy oh , of course it does n't work , you have easycd creator installed ! ok , i buy it , i go through the \( painful \) uninstallation process of roxio 's software no problems solved second guy oh , of course it does not work , it requires 10gb of free hard drive space ! it 's written on the box plain lie on the box it says you need 10gb for nerovision \( for burning videos \) , but only 1gb for nero quarrel \( they are tough ! \) with the guy who could not care less about the fact i got him lying , or that the product description is wrong ok , patiently i freed up 10gb from hard drive , try again , exactly same problem the only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement i got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720 , not a 710 , since 710 is not manufactured anymore \( wonder why \? \) notice i tried this on two different machines \( one laptop and one desktop \) , with identical results
i am on my third drive now , thanks to the first two breaking sony sent me the 720ul as a replacement for my 710ul , but it 's the same drive with the exception of some faster burn times and the 720ul does n't support mac os
who would even think about buying something that plugs into the wall for sixty bucks ! maybe thats why the ipod is so expensive
i had this adapter running in my the cardbus slot of my windows 98 computer and it ran fine i installed it on my windows 2000 laptop well , my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when i installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by microsoft so , imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got blue screen of death \( bsod \) crashes big blue screen , loss of data , computer freezes tight , power button inoperative , and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer , well , we all know that 's when you 're in computer hell
no way am i purchasing this for my ipod i would love to be able to charge my ipod away from my imac , but i refuse to purchase this this should of been included in the box it is a tremendous ripoff to buy an ac adapter seprately \( and at 30 \) , but then again , i'm sure apple is making a ton off of this gimic , but i refuse to contribute i can see not including a dock , a v cables , etc , as those are n't essential ipod accessories but an ac adapter \? come on bad apple bad !
i have been a dvr user through cox cable for approx 1 yr , and have always been disappointed i have kept my eye on tivo for some time , and when my dvr box went out for the 2nd time , i decided it was time to try tivo i got a refurbished series2 dvr that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for 12 95 per month
i bought a lot of panasonic stuff in the past without any problems but the picture quality on this thing is awful , even at the highest quality setting all i saw were blocky artifacts that seemed to be blinking i even had the dnr \( digital noise reduction \) enabled and it did n't help most recordings skipped and stuttered at the beginning i took it back for refund and best buy told me this model is known for doing that i do n't see how panasonic can put their name on this junk those cheap 99 recorders you find at walmart have better quality than this
heaven help you if you want to use this with the fm remote a very common usage at heath clubs which provide tv rebroadcasts over fm the fm remote connects to the ipod via a large plug on the left hand side the armband provides a small circular hole on the right hand side , but no means of connecting the large fm remote plug
this portable color tv does n't give me any channel that you can actually watch i returned it and i was credited however , much to my surprise i received the same five inch tv as i had returned it already cost me to have it returned since i did n't ask for it , should i consider it a gift
stay away from vonage ! i have had it for several months , and have been trying to cancel it i have been put on hold a minumum of 45 minutes to and hour each time , and then transferred to someone else who then does the bait and switch again when you go to their web site , the only thing you can get is their custumer service number , which takes you right back to the same old nonsense i need to cancel because of a military deployment , and all i'm getting is a run around the same thing happened with aol , but this is even worse there are tons of blogs out now about how vonage sucks check them out it 's no wonder this company is tanking , their customer service is the absolute worst ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i hope they read this they really need to change ! !
i had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble all of a sudden , today , as i went to pick up the lock , which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it , it decided to change combinations by itself so it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one i had set i tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites the fact that i even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock i ca n't rely on
i am in the process of looking to return the seal is not so good , so you have to run it through the machine a couple of times in addition , the lamination has ridges in it it is n't a smoothe finish \( and it is n't air pockets \? \?
i initially chose this router because of its low price sometimes , you get what you pay for , and that is exactly what happened to me as a wired router , this works well enough it connects four computers to the internet just do n't do anything to intense with it , and you should be fine i noticed that when i view video media , the connection totally freezes but for basic internet and downloading , it works
i 've been using my befw11s4 for a few months now the little thing has its good points a nice , unobtrusive little box i can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture , allowing my rather over laptop equipped household some nice convenient net access , while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection
i bought this router and spent almost two hours online with linksys after trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke english i finally understood that linksys has limited support for macs when i asked what limited support means , i was told we are not trained to help people with a mac if you can borrow a windows pc we can help you what a waste of time i am sending the router back beware if you have a mac
the first vista cx i purchased died after only 3 days of use i returned it to amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it the second unit lasted for 4 days until i fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen garmin 's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney the poorly designed t style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity i probably would n't buy buy another garmin but i'm stuck with them as i have already invested 200 in proprietary mapsource software i guess that was their plan
this is the best sounding pc speaker system available absolutley stellar sound quality for how long is a serious problem i too own 2 of these systems after eleven months of bliss my first amp also went out
the first subwoofer died \( no sound \) after 6 days remember , the sub powers all the speakers in this system i sent it back to the company i bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of klipsch 's faulty product they asked me if i would like a refund and like an idiot i said , no , just send me another one the replacement klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then nothing no power from the sub ! same problem but now my warranty is up klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty shame on klipsch for making such a shoddy product shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice heed all these warnings my friends i would buy used speakers at a garage sale before i would buy another klipsh product you have been warned !
these speakers do sound great but just like many others who have reviewed these speakers , they eventually just stop working it sounds like i was one of the lucky ones as mine lasted two years but i really did n't use them all that much and i do n't blast the volumes when you spend this kind of many on a product it should at least last 5 years or so i 've never had any other speaker brand just stop working on me before worse of all is to hear that klipsch is charging a lot of money to repair their faulty products and that people had problems with them even after they were repaired well , i'm not wasting time and money on repairing them i'm just switching to logitech no more klipsch ever again for me
i received the ipod quickly which was a plus but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked i sent it back and requested a refund it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my 120 back
i like other lacie drives i 've used very much , thought i 'd take a chance on this , but it just does not work it takes me about a hundred swipes on average to get the biometric sensor to work that is keeping data a bit too secure to be helpful also there have been reports of complete data loss by others , but i 've not had that experience could be i just have n't been able to get to my data enough to find out support from lacie was completely unhelpful \( wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which i have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion \) if the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion , the failure of biometrics would not be so serious , but as is , i would definitely not purchase this again , and i would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement
we have 50 of these cards at work and i have 4 at home i have never seen a more fragile pci card if you slam a door or stomp your feet near the pc , this card may very well cease to function on the next reboot god forbid you attempt to move the tower every other day , someone has a malfunctioning card which needs to be jiggled , removed and reinserted , or otherwise screwed with
we purchased this phone to go with the rest of the set and we were extremely disappointed ! ! we had to return them for a different brand because we could not hear ! ! ! they were so static that you often could not hear the person speaking ! ! you would think at this price it would not be so static we went for a brand at a much lower price and they are crystal clear !

you 'd think that a palm screen protector from palm would be best in class however , these palm premium screen protectors have a lifespan of about 3 4 days at best i'm very careful with my new palm tx , yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input i also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size i 've tried an invisible shield screen protector , and it was tough as nails the problem was that installation was difficult , and the tacky surface also produced input errors next i'm trying a boxwave cleartouch i never had this sort of problem with the old fellowes writeright protector , which lasted a year or more on my old palm m130
monster cable and its similarly overpriced imitators are a triumph of hype over substance , and ruthlessly exploits the consumer 's naivete and trust in shady audio video salespeople
i am disgusted to realize that although crucial markets this card as coming with a driver for win98se , it does not the cd it came with did not have a driver \( although it said it did \) the web sight does not have drivers and after two promises on the phone from crucial tech support promising to send me one , i still don't have it i don't believe this driver exists so much for truth in advertising and american company integrity
when i plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes , then the speaker 's internal power simply cut off happened on the ac adapter or batteries , whether i was using my computer or my ipod as the sound source same behavior every time
the koss pro4aat headphones are quality headphones , but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv to get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about , you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp also , the ear pads are of a vinyl like material which does n't breathe well , making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods i 've read that leatherette pads are available , but so far have n't been able to find them the warranty alone is great , but i would n't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp
device unexpectedly stopped working after 9 months has not been thru a washing machine , fallen in the ocean or been run over by a truck ! just nestled in my briefcase bullet proof case is great gimick , but this device is unreliable as a backup for road files might be better off using your pda with a large sd card
i had one that worked for a year that came with the original phone then , i just ordered this one from amazon and it worked for 30 days like other reviews you see here , people started not being able to hear me , but i could hear them so the microphone broke but , i called uniden tech support and they recommended i replace the battery on the phone for 37 so , i just ordered a new phone and tested the headset sure enough it was n't the phone it was the headset a costly mistake i would not buy this headset again also , amazon has a 30 day return policy , so if it breaks , make sure you return it within that 30 days or you are stuck with it
i just bought a new ratpadzgs to replace my four year old ratpadz compaired to the old ratpad , the ratpadzgs is made with a lower density cheap o \( tm \) plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech g7 mouse when using the mouse on the gs it causes the curser to sort of stutter along overall i would pass on this product , for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad
it was an okay mousepad for approximately a year and a half every so often , my optical mouse jittered from one edge of the screen to the other when left stationary , but i encountered no serious problems
i do n't like how easy it get scratch , and if u get the black one even worst , i went shopping for cases but they get scratch inside the cases too , just by been in the case , i return the case , then i when for those clear stickers and i recomend to put those on on a really clean table and very dry and clean hands may be use glove cause a little touch and there goes your finger print in the sticker , and with a black ipod you ca n't miss it and if u do n't take your time u will have a lot of air bubbles showing in your ipod , so after a week looks like something that i have for a year , it sucks
the netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because i mailed it to my son in tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine surely , i'm not so technically savvy as my son , but i can read and write and follow directions the setting up of the equipment is quite complicated , in my view , far moreso than it should be i 've set up other peripherals with success , but this product is more than i can handle i 've followed the directions , over and over , and still the router does n't connect i 've given up ca n't handle the frustration by the way , i'm way over the age of 13 i have grandchildren over the age of 13
after a bit of sweat i 've managed to get the printer working fine from both my xp and mac os tiger computers until i unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for set up then nothing happens i e no wireless printing
i contacted d link support and they verified that this product was tested and worked with a very minimum number of popular usb printers \( i believe the number was around 30 40 \)
several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite \( l r audio video \) cable , or an s video \( multi pinned plug \) almost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the tv uses different internal circuitry for each one virtually any s video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable , and any component \( individual r g b video \) connection will be better than s video cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it there may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another , but its almost always unnoticable
i was in the market to upgrade my printer and used amazon 's reviews to decide on a canon mp530 it does a good job , but when i plug the usb cord into the printer , the connection to the internet drops every time i have to disconnect from the printer so i can get on line recently i filled out a rather lengthy application on the internet and plugged in the usb cable so i could print that step caused the connection to drop and i got to reenter all the information i will be returning the canon mp530 and start my search for another all in one printer
the memorex u3 traveldrive is simply a piece of crap i bought it for easy data transfer when on travel , but it seldom works in any computer the logo comes up when i plug it in and it simply hangs there it 's utterly worthless
it was not worth the cost to ship it back
i bought with lots of ilussion this this ipod , i put all my music in it and use it ! ! after a 5 months it stop working , it did n't charge the battery i took it to best buy where i bought it and they told me that it has external damage and didn' repair it i send it to apple service and return it without services because the same reason my ipod did n't have that damage , it has only a few scratches on the screen after lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it i would have to pay us 250 00 that is almost what it cost new terrible service from apple short live don't recommended now i'm looking for another option for mp3 player to buy
the modem works well but was very hard to set up much harder than an apple airport that i had setup previousl
i recently purchased this item from amazon what i received was version 2 of this modem the current version on the linksys site is version 4 as a cox customer , the results of my purchase were unsatisfactory i will be returning this and purchasing the version 4 linksys from another vendor
a short list of grievances
is there a less than 1 star after 5month , it just stopped working , how do i get my money back not worth it for the money i have a smaller tv that i have had for 6 years and still works
i was never happy with this product the picture always had a green tint and would not adjust out after less than a year the tube blew out
this set lost color and picture quality over the few months that i owned it and then it just stopped working i'm going to buy something else and so should you
this phone is really cool but it has two major flaws the first is the caller id problem which the other posts have already described in som detail the second is that although the incoming volume is fine , the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and say that i sound 'far away and very soft' troubleshooting and reseting does n't seem to help will return asap
it looks sexy , but it just does n't work the scroll pad is so finicky i wanted to throw it out the window after the first hour about half the time it moves the cursor when you want to scroll , or it scrolls when you want to move the cursor the other half the time , it does nothing no matter what part of the pad you touch or how hard or lightly you press also beware that if you return this just because you 're not satisfied with how it works , amazon will charge you for both outgoing and return postage ! \( i 've giving it one star out of pity , and because it does look sharp
you may notice i am writing this in lowercase i am using the s510 keyboard i bought over a year ago the shift keys suddenly went out so the keyboard is now useless i have to subtract for longevity the mouse that comes with the keyboard is poor but i use it with another mouse anyway and , as noted in other reviews this , in common with most other usb keyboards , only works with basic functionality when hooked up through a usb kvm switch on the good side , the battery life is very good and i think it looks nice , but i 'll be looking for something else for a replacement
after seeing a wide range in the prices for hdmi cables , i did some research into why is it found out that these cables carry digital signals \( 0 's and 1 's \) , so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable , its basic purpose is simple like a cat5 cable then i went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine so , dont be fooled by the high price cables there is no special sheilding p in them its all misleading marketing for this length of cable , i would pay maybe 5
from reading the reviews the product weighs 14 oz and is tiny from reading amazon 's specs
do not be deceived by the photo this thing is tiny if that is what you are looking very small low volume very portable i suppose it is ok but over price for what you get i think 30 00 would have been about right there is no bass response and for there size how could there be i am keeping them but only because they are so small they might come in handy for hotel use only ! the packaging is very cool but the fidelity is non existent
i 've never had a product out after one week of use the screen froze up and no matter what troubleshooting tip i tried from the creative website , nothing worked now i'm waiting to hear back from email support because they do n't have 24 hour phone support not impressed would have gotten an ipod , but this thing was given as a gift
i really enjoyed my zen , when it worked the first one i ordered i had to return becuase it would only play every other song , and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and i would have to take out the battery to make it stop so , i exchanged it for a new one , and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again , it would freeze up , and would only play 5 seconds of every song what i liked about it , for the small amount of time i had it was the sound quality , the choice in colors , and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space i'm not sure i would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days now i have an iriver clix and have had no problems it has less storage but i do n't care , it is easier to control and i have n't had problems with it
i bought this as an extra support for my wrist and within 2 weeks the gel started to ooze from the seems i ended up having to staple all around the edges of the bean to stop the ooze which has worked but definately a design flaw
there are too many files you must hunt for online that are not on the cd if you can read chinese you may fare better than reading the english instructions for the software i'm returning mine and will try something a little more expensive but from a company with better quality control
we 'll give the unit two stars instead of one , since when it does work , it works well , with nice print outs
i 've had many fax machines and this one , when it worked , certainly was n't the worst of the bunch problem is , the auto document feed tray is cheesy no matter how many times i smoothed , then fanned the paper , it would accept two to five sheets at a time if i fed one at a time , this unit worked like a champ unfortunately , that can be said of most units i 've had good brother machines in the past , and probably will buy another , better , brother fax this one got me so frustrated i threw it out the back door it 's still laying there , only there seems to be more pieces now
this card does not work with nokia 6682 i bought this card from an other website and missed the earlier review here
the software it is sent with is different than the instructions given , i have yet to get it to work with my laptop w xp and a ir hp laser jet it may work fine for some cell apps phones etc
the memorex dvd r has got to be one of the worst dvd r 's out in the market not only is the rate of a successful dvd burn very low \( movies , games , etc \) , it also has a horrible shelf life that lasts for about four months from what i hear from other members , memorex uses a low quality dye , and is explicitly evident in the red colored deterioration of the dye that can be seen on the top layer of the disk all my dvd r 's are actually stained red for some reason \? ! \? overall , go with verbatim or heck , even compusa dvd 's will be more suffice than this garbage
i got this mp3 at a black friday sale and i was absolutly thrilled with it until the end broke off the end where the battery was broke off one day and would n't stay on i now have to hold it in place with rubber bands now , the player will constantly shut off whenever it moves the slightest bit the radio , however \( before it broke \) was great , the organization of the files was good and the mic worked okay if you talked straight into it overall , this was okay for the money i paid for it , but i would n't recommend this to anyone
be aware before you buy this flash drive that it will not accept file names with many commonly used characters like ' \? ' and ' ' when it encounters
we ordered this radio to have on hand in case of emergency after an hour of cranking to start the power , the crank came off got it back on , cranked more , came off again small heartattack later from all the fruitless cranking , we sent it back the next day looking for another option for an emergency radio , have n't found one yet
i bought one of these , brand new when i use it with a portable cd player radio on the proper settings for my unit , the radio works for about 15 seconds , then shuts down like the other reviewer , i'm wondering if the voltages are off will try a meter
i bought this for my 80 year old mother , who is disabled and ca n't cope with a computer every time the typewriter is turned on , we find that it either types the wrong letter \( press a q , it prints an s press e and get p , etc \) or else it prints the correct letter but they are not spaced correctly \( some overlapping , some huge spaces \) there is some esoteric combination of keystrokes that , supposedly , will reset the programming but this is just too much for mom also , every time it 's turned on , you have to re program the line spacing , the tabs and everything else i ended up buying a 40 year old manual typewriter on e bay and mom is much happier with it
this printer binds up on two pieces of paper ! if there is the least resistance during a jam , the flimsy plastic gears become stripped and the printer is trash this is what happened to me after less than two months of light use and i stayed within the manufacturer 's guidelines however , there is no warrantee on this printer , so buyer beware
happy with the three tips included , i decided to try these for the heck of it while they go nicely and comfortably deep into the ear and do n't dare come out until you intend for them to , for some reason , they diminish the quality of the sound greatly i can most closely describe it as the sound of overcompressed mp3s they took nearly all of the clarity out of the music
i really enjoyed my zen , when it worked the first one i ordered i had to return becuase it would only play every other song , and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and i would have to take out the battery to make it stop so , i exchanged it for a new one , and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again , it would freeze up , and would only play 5 seconds of every song what i liked about it , for the small amount of time i had it was the sound quality , the choice in colors , and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space i'm not sure i would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days now i have an iriver clix and have had no problems it has less storage but i do n't care , it is easier to control and i have n't had problems with it
i recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand the stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop that works great the keyboard , however , is fairly awful , and i'm returning it
after purchasing the stylus , i immideatley noticed that the styli were far significantly lighter in weight than the factory included stylus for the tungsten t5 even worse , after a fatal exception and hard lock on the t5 , i noticed that these styli have no built in pin to hit the reset button with
there is nothing good to say about this speaker except the size the sound quality sucks it stops mid song on a regular basis it is just a piece of crap it is so crappy that i am throwing it away rather than give to someone
i bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be no more equipment in the tv room ! about two weeks ago though , i noticed that the unit was slower and slower and i had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done it has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all at first i thought it was batteries in the remote , so i replaced those a few times then i thought the placement of the ir transmitter was off , so i moved it closer to my av rack that worked at first , but the problem persisted so i reprogrammed , but to no avail eventually i narrowed it down to the remote unit even with the remote right next to the ir transmitter , it now does not work most of the time of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room , so standard ir remotes \( why do they even make those still \? \? \? \? \) are out of the question i will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossed
the ge superadio iii used to be a great radio i bought my first one seven years ago and it worked so well that i bought another i have recently purchased two more as gifts and they are not the same radio side by side they look the same \( except for the numbers on the tuning dial \) inside they have dissimilar circuit boards the real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios i would recommend not purchasing this radio
i was very disappointed with the ge superadio 3 i owned a superadio2 10 years ago which was far superior my advice save your money i had trouble with stations less than 90 miles away this radio is very overated piossibly poor quality control
i order this item and it got lost in the mail they resend it which was fine but , as soon as i recieve it i turn on the this item and the screen turned blank i advised not to buy this item
as mentioned by others the actual product does not look like the photo and is a little on the flimsy side that did not concern me too much my problem is that it does not work properly with my samsung 13 inch color tv it turns the set on and off and steps up down the channels but i cannot ehter a two digit channel number and have it go to the correct channel for example , if i enter 54 it goes to 55 i tried all the listed setup codes given in the instructions
about 1 year after having this remote to go along with my phillips dvd player the remote conked out the buttons , while almost all responsive , will not sync up with the systems anymore , and the learning feature on the remote control seems to be defunct you get what you pay for , i suppose
i had reservations when buying according to online reviews many of these devices seem to be defective \( the belkin as well \) i purchased anyway and my fears were confirmed leds do not light , does not transmit on any frequency manufacturer representative \( from india \) confirmed that it is defective return will be time consuming and frustrating , but 50 is enough to make me endure even more pain do n't buy this item
ca n't say much for the video or sound quality , menu options , or anything really , since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching monsters , inc on dvd playback just froze , the thing stopped recognizing that dvds were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again , and after another minute it would n't even start playing the thing at all , just whirred a lot
great dvd vcr combo but does not play dvd 's from other region does not have an eject button on the remote either if u have dvd 's , vcd from other countries that you would be playing i do not recommed this player
my player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had , which ended up rendering it useless \( out of warranty \)
this music player was decent nice look , controls , and sound there are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive there are really good things about this unit however , the faults are just too great thus , superseding the great features
i purchased this product and ran home to try it out not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer , my computer freezes i restart and it says my device is malfunctioning i manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again i try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network i'm a network engineer and i am well versed in what i am doing , but this card has given me nothing but trouble i had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect this only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing i talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor is n't supported , which is total bs and just an attempt to get out of supporting me , they would n't even let me return the product my advice go with linksys or d link or smc , anyone but netgear
several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite \( l r audio video \) cable , or an s video \( multi pinned plug \) almost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the tv uses different internal circuitry for each one virtually any s video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable , and any component \( individual r g b video \) connection will be better than s video cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it there may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another , but its almost always unnoticable
i bought this product less than a year ago 2 days ago , i locked my laptop and tried to unlock it but i could n't it was somehow messed up and the combination did not work i had to cut it ! ! ! i do n't know how it got messed up but i'm sure that it was not study enough to last long
i have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination suddenly i could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself
while i do n't have any evidence to refute the package claim that it attaches to any notebook , once attached to my son 's computer it was almost impossible to remove it took 10 minutes to get it off and we were pulling so hard i thought we would damage the computer we will be returning it not recommended
the first unit could n't even find fm stereo stations it had similar fm specs as the sony st jx410 am fm tuner it was replacing it was returned as a faulty unit the replacement strde 197 was able to find stereo fm stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo my 25 year old jx410 tuner did an excellent job on fm stereo stations the second unit was returned for a refund sony 's quality is n't what it use to be i bought an onkyo tx sr304 the fm works fine with more features expandability
i bought this receiver from amazon , received it about 10 days ago since then , i 've tried to play my cassettes of classical music when used for this purpose , this receiver sucks big time if i turn the volume loud enough to hear the orchestra playing softly , when the orchestra gets loud the amp shuts down protect flashes on off i have to turn the receiver off , then turn it back on , lower the volume then of course when the music gets soft again , i ca n't hear it
i bought one of these , it has a bad audio crackling noise on every mode except fm tuner \( an obvious defect \) sounds like a capacitor going bad , not sure how it got through final test
after two months , this phone stopped working it was returned to panasonic repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6 8 weeks this is not customer service panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone when called today to check on status of order , answer was basically tough luck never again , panasonic amazon should discontinue this brand
as others have reported , my latch broke as well , but i broke it within three days of ownership within a month , i cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when i was removing it from the case to sync it at the time , the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable bought a rhinoskin to replace this look elsewhere before you purchase this one
ok , so it protects the tx on a fall , however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks , rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own
i purchased the case along with my new palm tx to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it it 's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner the little plastic catch in the lid half , which keeps the case closed , never seemed to work quite correctly , requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut on a trip on march 3rd , this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away now it has no catch to keep it closed since the case cost me about 24 new and i 'd only get about half price for the return , i figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return i 'll use a rubber band around the case , reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is save your money and do n't buy this case i do n't remember reading the reviews before i ordered it so there 's a 24 lesson
of the various ipod cases i 've tried i found this one to be the worst the click wheel cover is impractical and annoying and the screen cover falls out all too easily using plastic in rubber hinges was a bad idea which simply does not work well see my other reviews for better ipod protectors
i was delighted with my toughskin for all of two hours that 's how long it took for the belt clip to break , rendering my new purchase worthless to me
first off , i bought this headset for gaming , which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we should n't be able to feel i have been searching high and low for the holy grail of comfort and i was certain paying 90 for a gaming headset would be the end of my search sorry , these guys are going back
terrible no bass j type wiring is hard to adjust to substandard product for panasonic avoi
i 've been a fan of sony earbuds for many years due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest sony earbuds , i decided on purchasing these panasonic headphones i bought these headphones because my sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory creative zen micro headphones i found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs i 've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings it 's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise i like the around the neck feature as far as quality , the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it as far as the performance of the headphones , i'm really disappointed in these headphones my factory creative headphones had out performed these the bass level is too low even when i max out the bass in the player the mids and treble sound like crap do n't waste your money on these ! now i have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones ! argh !
we tried the belkin in one car when we turned the ipod on , the car battery immediately discharged \( we had to buy a new car battery \) and the ipod died we bought another belkin and tried it in a different car and with a different ipod \( in case the first incident was a coincidence \) and this ipod died too the ipods were under warranty , the car battery was not we tried this with 2 different belkins , in 2 different cars with 2 different ipods i would not recommend this product to anyone
these labels were advertised with the seiko label printer they did not work with the printer because the printer requires thermal labels i sent these labels back to amazon and they promptly refunded my money
instead of getting this just get the cheaper skins i figured to get the nicer one since i already shelled out all my money on an ipod , but it is a lot of money for a carrying case definetly get the skins
the case looks nice , but not practical everytime you need to change the volume or track you have to pull your ipod out my ipod had scratch marks on it the first week unfortunately , all the picture you see of this case is from the side view , so you cannot see that there is no opening for the wheel and the display i recommend iskin product
maybe i got a defective pair , but the noise cancel barely does anything , maybe cuts out 3 not worth it , taking back and trying something else
the radio works great except the last 2 sony walkman am fm radios i have had you were able to clip onto your waiste band when exercising it was just a large clip thing this new one has a different type that you have to use a belt with ! and who uses a belt to work out \? i certainly dont so i am using a very large safety pin thru the hole in the back and then i pin it onto my shorts which has made a nice hole in the material of two pairs otherwise it is a great item
i actually meant to order the philips 7 incher \( brighter screen , 20 cheaper , bulkier \) , but somehow i got confused when i placed the order this one looked beautiful so i was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it i was planning on using this for work , as i get a lot of dvd 's from clients so i popped one of those in and guess what \? it came up as invalid disc it 's supposed to play the majority of formats , and i triple checked the disc in my other dvd players , and it worked in my panasonic dvd vhs combo player a store bought dvd worked fine \( although i did n't play it much more than the first menu \) so i know it 's not broken
i ordered 2 of these , realizing they would have limited adjustment range other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel what prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight this model is supposed to hold a 25 lb monitor it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb imac there is no tension adjustment \( already as tight as it would go \) and the computer just flopped forward with a light monitor , i'm sure it would be fine , but do n't expect even close to the stated 25 lb rating
i spent 400 16 months ago on two very similar portable audiovox dvd players for my kids , for long roadtrips they were handled with care , never abused or exposed to severe temperatures i think we got about 6 trips out of them , then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other circuit city informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to audiovox , who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty extended warranties are useless on this kind of product who can wait 6 8 weeks for repairs \? parents , find another brand
bought one from amazon , they sat on the order for a week before shipping a unit that arrived dead went through the return replacement process and they sat on the order for over a week this time and the that one arrived dead with the exact same failure mode
my first gps it was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features \( ability to save many tracks \) the software is very us centric
i purchased two of these units the first one worked ok the second one has a problem in a side by side comparison the signal qualities of the two units vary i checked there accuracy and tracking with oziexplorer moving map software the first unit tracks pretty good , but the second units position is off a large percentage of the time and sometimes as much as 400 meters i sent the faulty unit to garmin to be repaired they sent it back with a description of the problem and that it had been fixed i checked the unit out and it is the same as when i sent it to them now i'm stuck with a dud
my brand new card failed the first time i tried to download pictures from it i lost all of the pictures from my two week trip to guatemala
this has got to be the worst camera out there i do n't even think it 's suitable for my 13 year old son the pictures come out horrible ! good thing it was purchase mainly with gift certificates i'm still sorry i wasted them on this piece of junk
i purchased this camera for my daughter for christmas it was small , compact , and fairly inexpesive , perfect for a preteen first , it took forever to charge \( the instructions indicate that it takes four hours \) after waiting for hours , my daughter attempted to take pictures , but the camera would not work the manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the lcd display , but none of these symbols appeared on this camera i am returning the camera immediately and i would not advise anyone to purchase one
i bought this so called stereo system at a big lot 's store for about 40 00 i figured since they were selling it there it must be a good deal , and it looked very cool too it worked for about a month before it started skipping and remote was wigging out it never sounded any better than one of those old plastic 45 record players it looked good in my daughters bedroom but it lookes and sounds much better in the dumpster i ca n't believe this company can get away with selling this worthless crap i will never buy anything from them again
i would love this keyboard except for the spacebar , which sticks very badly it installed easily is sleek and comfortable but is not usable for very long because of this glitch i'm starting to see more reviews on this spacebar problem so it looks to be fairly common with this model
i 've loved these headphones for the year or two i 've had them i still love them now when they work the problem is that the cord is shoddy when i plug into my laptop i have a hard time keeping it working i have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work if its not just right i 'll get sound in only one ear , if at all i do n't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk i do n't think it has ever left my office and i do n't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it overall i like these things , but i'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit
i purchased this in the hope that i would be able to record verbal messages to myself , creative thoughts and ideas , etc it does an adequate job of that i had also hoped i could use it as a simple player , to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day this it wo n't do , and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the olympus site that it would not function this way
i was not able to get this card working with my win2k laptop i'm no novice , have configured the rest of my wireless network without any problem , and have had a friend 's netgear card working in the same system i called tech support and after working with me they said the card was defective and to send it back , which i did however , i had the same problem with the replacement card so , i ca n't recommend this product

1 buttons are too small , some of which are not spaced apart very well \( very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button \)
i had this 6 months \( which is how long it takes to figure out how to use it ! \) and the backlight is no longer working so i ca n't see the time , without a flashlight or lamp
i had these headphones for a few years then they got crushed in half in my bag they hurt your ears after about ten minutes they are durable though i would recommend the kind that clip behind your ear
my this earbud headphone is poor in bass response comapared to my sony mdr g 54lp \( beware mdr g54lp and mdr g54lp is two different models there is difference of sign \) actually in experts view this type small earbuds use to give poor sound this is true with any brand and model so never buy earbud type small headphone if you want small headphone buy in the ear canal type headphone in experts view this type in ear earphone use to give good crystal clear sound example sony mdr ex 71 81 , shure e2c etc if bigger headphone is ok than buy mdr g54lp
while the price of the 8 in 1 card reader is reasonable , consider this this card reader has a nasty habit of rendering smart media card useless evidently , if you cut and paste or delete data on the sm card using thee 8 in 1 card reader , the reader rewrites the signature file so that it cannot be read by the camera so that 24 card has the potential to cost you over 80 00 in addition , customer service is slow and i have had problems with the drivers
would n't it be nice to know what eight types of media the device will handle
i ordered the passport x50 from amazon to save the 18 shipping escort radar was charging i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller
i bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function , but the result is terrible it greatly degrades the signal when i use it with tv , the program on tv became unclear when i use it with computer , the high speed internet kept dropping
i bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio i like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station , but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit , which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations i didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product , looking back , i should have i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there are n't many stations that you can listen to on the radi
it broke after two uses it has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and i plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds i was so mad i threw it out the window what a waste of thirty bucks
the bel rx65 worked great , for about 1 month after that , it started flashing selfcal and service requiered on the screen sent it in to bel for them to fix the problem after about 10 days i got the product back , only to have it repeat exactly the same problems again within 2 days of having it i feel like i 've been ripped off , because they either did n't even look at it or they do n't know how to test something for a problem i spent 300 for a detector that does n't work as well as a 40 one \( and i know , i 've had both \) !
these things are not worth the money get a cheap one ! look at http www radarbusters com or www 007radardetectors com or www consumersearch com
you ca n't plug two of these in side by side , the plastic surrounding the business ends are too fat
do n't listen to any of us you already have an internet connection because you are here go to a browser and ask the question you asked here you will find that any review that is not a store will tell you that all speaker wire is the same they just look cool if that 's what you need , then buy it otherwise , stay away from monster it 's just like bose speakers
at first it was n't a bad unit but it broke within a year now that i read the past reviews , i see i'm not alone
got this unit on march 28th 2005 at circuit city had it for exactly 2 weeks and the disk stopped spinning ! took it back to the store and they didnt have another one so they told me i could pick it up at another one of their store locations and it would be ready for me to pick up ! picked it up took it home and couple of days later went to use it and it didnt spin ! ! ! right out of the box ! ! ! took it back to circuit city and they said they could only find the receipt on file for the first one \( that got returned \) and not for this one after much debate nothing got done for me at circuit city because the receipt they gave me back was the old one and now i'm stuck with this peice of junk i paid 369 00 for and circuit city sucks too ! called audiovox today 7 19 05 \( waited a while i was busy giving birth at the end of may \) and they told me the 90 days were up \( by 10 days ! \) and could only fix it for a flat rate of 93 00 plus ship ! ! ! i am pissed of
i love this mouse ! it 's compact and picks up the signal on just about every surface i gave it 2 stars because i figured out that it was preventing my laptop from going into idle mode \( windows xp , sp2 \) sadly , i'm going to have to get another mouse because of that
is very neet item especiatlly since it is usable with 1 1 speed as well as 2
i bought it last april and i didnt realize that slide lock key was too weak , and now i try to write data but a message is about the data is secure \( locked \)
samsung is the worst we bought this tv in august and it was delivered in september to our new house we opened it on a sunday , plugged it in and watched it for a while , then on monday it would not come on they thought it was a lamp , but that did n't fix it so they came and got it to service it we bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no tv they decided to replace it since they could n't fix it that was three weeks ago now they are giving us the runaround blaming shipping warehouse etc for the delay in sending the new one during a phone conversation with samsung they basically said they were so far behind on shipping because they had so many to ship out \( ie lots of them have problems and are being replaced is the way i took it
after waiting almost 6 months for this skypephone , and its competitor from belkin , to come to market through numerous postponements , i just gave up and bought an asus p525 smartphone for just over double the price of the netgear i got a windows ce pda with gsm capability and full skype compatibility when browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through gsm or skype because you have built in wi fi , you can make skype calls and chats from any covered area , plus you can go on the internet using ie and check your e mails with outlook i have also read that the skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the netgear and the belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power , whereas with a windows ce based device you have much faster processors that allow a skype software closer to the one used on pcs
this phone is a total piece of garbage freezing , rebooting , not being
amazon does not ship to post office boxes the mouse could only be shipped to a post office box per amazon shipping proticol therefore , after two attempts to purchace this product from amazon i had to buy elsewhere if you live where the united states postal service does not deliver the mail to your house , pass of this item if not amazon i have considerable expierance buying mail order and online and this is the first time i have found a company setting rules that actually prevent the buyer from recieving the product
i bought this printer about 4 months ago the prints are beautiful , and the speed quite good as well however , i felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of x color installed it happens now between every print job , forcing me to open the printer , pull out and re install one to three of the tanks , and then print my document there is something wrong with this thing , and i do n't appear to be the first experiencing it figures i wait eight years to replace my printer , and end up with one that malfunctions ! i will attempt to return this item
i love the basic design , great hardware software linkage , and software interface of this mac happy scanner however , i value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit i received last week it inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed so , if you 're scanning a 10 page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way , have you really accomplished anything \? no you must either try the whole thing again \( with likely the same result \) , or you must figure out what page \( s \) is missing , scan it separately , and go thru a simple yet not expedient acrobat process to insert the omitted page in the end , this machine made it 90 of the way to being a really great product , but the shortcoming fouls half the machine 's overall utility swing a little bit harder next time fujitsu
i 've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware , and multiple calls to d link support , and this piece of junk still does not work with the d link dwl g700ap d link support calls are worthless as a computer professional , i find it appalling that d link would introduce and continue to sell this product , which clearly does not operate correctly
i bought this machine on august 3 , 2005 and within one week of using it \( as an outgoing fax only \) , there was a machine error i called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes i was able to speak with a live representative i was told that the machine would need to be replaced they sent me a refurbished unit \( the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units \) they sent the base unit only , so i had to remove the drum unit , paper tray , and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit so , after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit , i was back on hold to report another machine error 12 minutes and i finally get a rep apparently , the drum unit \( which is less than one month old \) is bad so now i'm waiting for the replacement drum unit don't ever buy a brother machine they're horrible machines and trying to get through to customer service is very , very time consuming
wow this is a real piece of junk if you have any other wireless devices going on in the home and who nowadays does n't \? there is so much noise you ca n't even hear yourself think oh well lesson learned if i could have given this device a zero i would have
i was terribly disappointed in this product which i bought for use in my canon pixma ip6000d printer the image is grainy and , if you touch the photo within 5 minutes , you will leave marks i laid anothe picture on top of one done 5 minutes earlier , and they stuck together i have had very good luck with canon paper
this would be a great product is the chemical smell was not so bad and last so long it has a horrible smell that just will not go away i saw others mention the same issue but thought i would give it a try it smells
yes , yes , i know griffin has ipod mini compatability all over their roadtrip web page but the sad fact is , when you recieve it you will not find an adapter for the ipod mini in the box although there are adapters for other ipods when you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from apple computer to make it work calling apple , i find that they no longer sell the adapter when i called griffin i was surprised to find that if you have any other ipod than mini and the adapter is not in the box , they will send you one they recommended that i return the roadtrip , which is what i did save yourself the aggrevation if you have an ipod mini stay away from griffin technology
i had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the fvs338 the main reason is the speed i have a lab and we tested the max internet throughput of the fvs318 's at 1 2mbps ! this is unacceptable oh yes , this is with the latest firmware
most reviews do n't seem to mention a key spec the throughput of a firewall i just upgraded my cable connection to the new \( up to \) 30mbs plan and bought an fsv318v3 firewall to use with it without the firewall in place , i measured about 25mbs download speed when i installed the firewall in between the modem and one computer , download speed went down to 6 5mbs i also discovered that if the enable keyword blocking checkbox is enabled , the throughput went down to 5mbs , even if there were no keywords !
surprisingly poor quality for a uniden phone volume is very low hard to hear caller do n't waste your money
we had such high hopes for this product and sadly had to return it only 20 feet away from the base unit , the clarity was very , very poor we 've owned many regular cordless phones of varying quality and price points , yet the least expensive of these were better than this they just were n't waterproof it 's a great concept if they could just make them work well sure wish we could find a good waterproof phone ! !
do n't get me wrong , this is a pretty clever gadget however , it 's mising one thing in terms of usability an on off switch this really limits the usability of both , since it 's typical to want to turn the flashlight off for a moment , or the laser pointer on for a moment i ca n't see me using this laser pointer in a real presentation , since it 'd either be on all the time , or i 'd be pulling the light in and out all the time \( neither of which make me look cool \)
finally
this mousepad may seem as a great product but at times the rest becomes a little bit tiresome , and i think it get 's in the way of my hand and the mouse it did take me a great deal of time to get used to this pad but anyone else who use 's it has found it in the way and annoying i have to agree with this , b c it truly does get into the way of my hand and its a little bit confusing also it is much bigger than most mousepad 's it takes up a great deal of space
the noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range \( 60 list , 35 amazon \) the cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged , but i do n't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into \( combined with the stronger cord , better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears \)
i had the same exact experience with the poor fit of these headphones and the rude customer service their 'surround sound' he 592 phones do n't fit well either
if you 're not that picky about sound quality with music , then these may work for you i think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal to me , the music is all mids it 's missing significant highs and lows for this price range
so i was satisfied with the noise cancelling qualities the cloth cable is very nice and does n't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones i liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning the headphones i purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and i found only one to be suitable for my ears of course , after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now i ca n't use these earphones until i find a replacement somewhere , which is proving to be troublesome super i did n't buy these on clearance at target so that hurts my pocketbooks and i am very annoyed right now in the meantime , i 've returned to some 10 non earbud headphones and i really miss the noise cancelling quality of these philips earbuds life sucks and i want to die because now i can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation
i agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality i wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on tvs that have the 3 jacks on the front games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad no info on this from monster looks like a very good product but i will return it unfortunately i did discover though that i can use a stereo jack with r l on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any tv or stereo for my itunes , and audio for a dvd that i am playing but i do n't need to spend this much money to get that if the image were good i would keep it i would rather show my slide shows from the computer the image was very bad
i have had this phone for about three years i bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker phone \( with mute \) for long conference calls it was quite expensive \( i paid 200 to get it \) but here are what i have found to be its shortcomings no caller id display this just baffles me i get caller id on all other phones in the house except this one i have tried every possible varient \( resetted settings , disconnected other phones , etc \) but nothing works i always get no id message on the lcd the second major shortcoming is that called parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone one way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly , but that sort of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded phone \( hence will not work in case of emergencies \) finally , two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter one good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good , has a professional appearance , and claims to have a duplex speakerphone
sound output is terrible , you ca n't hear it in a car or airplane \( with high quality , noise cancelling earphones \) when i called customer service they told me it was not intended for use in a car or airplane picture is very good , but i have heard better sound from much cheaper players do n't waste your money
i just purchased yesterday the home dock deluxe for list price at a local retailer i read all the reviews , \( most of them bad but i got it anyway \) the menu on tv part being my motivation and so far , i am not feeling good about buying it
the mouse pad is a great idea with superb support for the wrist unlike some customers , i did not detect any odors or problems with the materials use in the gel pad however , the mouse pad did not work with my logitech optical mouse great idea but poorly implemented
wow , i ca n't believe how much i hate this bag and it was expensive , compared to some of the stuff i passed up i thought i could n't go wrong with targus but i could and i did first , the strap is horrible it keeps getting twisted and i have marks on my shoulder from where it cuts in to it 2nd , it 's really heavy lastly , there 's all these compartments that do n't do anything and mostly get in the way like the phone add on my phone does n't fit in there , and even if it did , would i carry my phone on my bag \?

not so happy ordered one of these and plugged by pda which did not charge
i hate this contraption and i stupidly let 30 days pass before i realized how much i hate it now i start every morning with a boy i hate this thing why \? well here are few reasons why you cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18 and to get a backlight you must depress any button not a bad idea but horribly executed the backlight lasts four seconds way too fast in the night and any button is a lie because you ca n't press stop nor the on for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then , in the dark , have to figure out how to terminate the cd player spends more time reading your cd than it does playing it the tuner band button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to , the screech of a not tuned in am station happens way too often the worst of it all was i called eton to tell them how much i hated it , just thought they might want to know i had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something , but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer designer so i waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it \( everything is wrong , but they do n't count that \) there is nothing they can do he offered to trade mine for a different one just the same and i said why bother it was a classic story of i made it so it is by definition without errors now leave me alone , just buy it and be thrilled with my brilliant design
i loved this speaker system when i got it last year but in the last few months it developed a loud humming noise that makes it so you can not hear your music very disapointed
1st the ipod is expensive it should at least come with a protective cover 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called disk mode which freezes the unit up and cant be played theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes for the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happe
i 'd really like to know how i listen to the radio at night and have it shut off in an hour and then have the alarm go off when i need it i thought that 's what a radio was supposed to do
do not believe the positive reviews ! ! ! ! ! ! ! like most of the other reviews this case scratched my ipod bad ! ! !
does not work with my creative zen can leave plugged in overnight and it does not charge at all
do not waste your money , this was under recommendations , but i would not recommend this with your creative zen
what a waste of money i wish someone had posted before the dec 22 posting \( which was excellent \) pointing out that this device does n't work on an ipod shuffle i spent more to ship this item than i did for the item itself , so i am also stuck with one
using the component input on your tv can make a huge difference in picture quality , but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable save yourself 50 and buy the cheap ones
i bought this drive with the advice from my father who has bought several lacie 's for his company he 's always had good luck with them
what a disappointment that what i thought was a reputable company makes such an unreliable product after about a years time , my lacie drive started clicking and then , no data it completely failed i too made the mistake of trusting this drive and did n't back it up i am sick about what i 've lost i 've emailed lacie about the failure and have not received a reply beware of lacie external drives
i had one of these a couple years ago it worked very well for a few months then , all of a sudden , the left analog stick became non responsive it would n't work on any game i tried after reading other reviews on the gamepad , i figured i just got one that was poorly made and that the analog stick problem i had was just one of those several ones that was bad since it was only 20 , i just left it alone well after going months without a gamepad , i decided to get another logitech gamepad , the same one i had , and guess what after literally one day , the right analog stick stuck and is completely unresponsive so , as far as i'm concerned they 're all terrible controllers period
i own a sony dsc s40 i had lost my sony memory stick so i thought i 'd try this one i purchased it the end of june and almost every time i take a video and try to veiw it , it will play and at any point durring a video it will stop and say file error this also causes a problem while i download them onto my pc only once had it done this on a picture and i ended up having to delete the picture because it would n't download sometimes it just do n't pay to save money i will never purchase this kind of memory stick again
antonline sent me the wrong item and then wanted nothing to do with me when i went to exchange it they have no phone number , so they email everything it takes them a day to get back to you and they always have an air about them as if you are bothering them for thier mistake after days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me , they agreed to take the product back , but i had to eat the first shipping charge , pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20 restocking fee \( for thier error ! ! \) the item was only like 10 , so by the time i would have paid the shipping and restock fees , i would be in the whole , so i decided to just tell them to go f k themselves i feel better now
from day one , back in late august 2006 , i 've had problems with this router which i bought only because my isp would n't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord since i work from home , this was n't an option at the time i'm not a tech guy , i do n't care much for gadgets , but i'm not stupid either , and i could n't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of windows i do n't , i have an imac once set up , the router worked fine for about a month , and then i started experiencing connectivity issues i called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such , reset my static ip , and all was well for another week , when the same issue losing connection with the router after 10 20 minutes online arose again so i called support again , got a guy after 7 minutes , but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update , and then basically hung up on me unacceptable so i called back , sat on hold for 40 minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone finally , after a third try , i got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface , only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day my isp is coming tuesday to install another outlet no documentation the install cd is configured for windows and would n't work in mac os x online help sucks the 800 support line sucks this product sucks do not buy it
i purchased this router \( not from amazon \) about 6 months ago when my 5 year old , very reliable , router died i purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it i have had numerous problems with this router since then it does not stay connected and there is actually no option for always on after having some other problems , i took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware after that , it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be re entered then today , after being instructed to reset the router , it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade \( there was no apparent way out of this \) so , i obtained the upgrade and according to the router message , it was updated successfully after that , i could not get the router to work at all i gave up and ordered an entirely different router \( the same brand that i has used before with tremendous success \) my summary save yourself time and aggravation and do n't buy the linksys wrt54g
ordered for my hp4705 this is not a bluetooth keyboard they sent two of them both the same non bluetooth item now i have to send back and hope i get credit

i absolutely love this product my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence i hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking arguments with my dog all barking and fighting has ceased all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now
i purchased 3 units and they work well for us i have 2 units in children 's bedrooms on ac power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability the sound is clear and set up and use is very easy the best thing about these units is the vox answer option i have this option turned on in the kid 's room and they merely have to answer back when i talk to them first without having to push the talk button this is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr old that does n't quite understand how to use this i attached a large , very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and i keep it on my fridge but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary the only small annoying feature is every time the talk button is pressed , a beep occurs but the other features outweight that small annoyance for me
i 've always wanted a deep fryer , and finally decided to take the plunge after doing quite a bit of research , i decided on this model picked one up at bed , bath , and beyond with a 20 coupon in my opinion , you generally get what you pay for so the extra cost vs competitors was n't a real concern
easy to use , easy to clean two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy this thing is easier to clean than my old george foreman grill \( and that to me was a pain in the neck \) the only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil , which i do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much i 've used it and what i 've cooked if i'm doing just veggies , i keep the oil if i do a meat or seafood , i 'll change the oil right after
i 've been a german knife snob for years but this 8 inch chef 's knife by japan 's global is the finest blade i 've ever owned period
i have a number of booklites , different vendors , different styles , some ac adapter , some straight battery , cheap to higher prices , and this one is the best , the brightest , the one i will most often use it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times i am careful with such items , do n't expect any problems , most booklites are not meant to be manhandled
used vet 's rx to treat my dog 's ear and it didnt seem to work after reading reviews i decided to try this after only 1 week i noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better would recommend to others
i was so thrilled when i unpacked my processor it is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance it has so many features that i love , especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time the egg beater attachment is excellent also i am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all
the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised it has three nested work bowls the inner , smallest one takes a special blade \( a smaller version of the standard processor blade \) it 's perfect for pulverizing mixing small quantities of things pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest , 12 cup bowl
i love this bookcase my only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split \( a bit \) , but it still fit together , so i kept it \( excuse the rhymes , please \) it 's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books , including some big heavy hardcovers , 20 dvds , 3 dvd box sets , 12 videotapes , and a few pictures and knicknacks and yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom best part the ease with which you can put it together i have ms , so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal highly recommended
as a tea lover for 30 years , i have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost benefit and performance i 've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it 's still working perfectly it boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while a
my only reservation is for safety sake , it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless , because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet
this kettle is amazing it 's simple you plug it in and flip the switch \( a light turns on to let you know it 's working \)
i love using them and when washed in fabric softener they are great it is a great deal was kind of worried before purchase from reading some of the other reviews but after having had them a week , my whole family loves them they are much better than the more expensive famous designer towels that i have for people who are complaining about these towels , go price similar items at your local high end department stores
braun makes the best coffee makers and this feature makes it even better the coffee tastes more smooth because of this filter i love it
great kit however the book that comes with the kit needs some work the photos in the book are not accurate with the descriptions i recommend that if you need canning instructions or recipes you get a separate book
when i first saw this pattern on line , i was truly impressed with the design this pattern was exactly what i had been searching for such a long time
as a mathematician , game theorist , and proud chi omicron chi \( xox , aka xocks \) brother , i have always been interested in this the simplest of m , n , k games , i e games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row as every game theorist knows , perfect tic tac toe play by both players results in a tie game every time , with neither player achieving victory the clever child will figure this out on her own , as i did at an early age , and i lost interest in playing tic tac toe before i turned five i never lost interest , however , in studying tic tac toe and similar games , which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory , and partly accounts for my joining chi omicron chi as a college freshman as part of our initiation , pledges had to play a modified form of tic tac toe with vodka filled shot glasses for markers each player had five glasses , and as he placed his marker , he would empty his glass the loser would drink the remaining shot glasses most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic tac toe , so really the point of the game , as with most fraternity games , was to see who could best hold his liquor i do remember one unfortunate pledge , bob , who never figured out how to play perfect tic tac toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia
these knives are great they are very sharp and of high quality
i thought i could n't live without my cuisinart or kitchen aide this product goes on the same list ! ! ! this was the easiest , best performing kitchen gizmo i have ever had a must for entertaining and holiday baking simple , easy no mess ! gone are the days with the one at a time with the gas burner ! ! love it , love it ! !
this is my third pair of kitchen shears the first was 10 and lasted a week i thought the second pair was just fine until my shun shears arrived these cut well and are also very smooth while cutting they fit my hand nicely i can really feel the difference in quality these can perform different functions opening bottles , jar opener , nut cracker one blade has a curve in it to accomodate bone i love that they are dishwasher safe
the knife is solid and very comfortable in hand , however , when i got it new , the blade is slightly bent i expect it to be in almost perfect condition , but it 's not
this knife is well worth the money it is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables , fruit you name it honestly , i felt it was too much for me but as i got better accustomed to its heft , i knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool do not doubt yourself , learning to use it is a joy treat yourself
i really like this tea press it is the perfect size for one person
i made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans , and the results were consistenly mediocre
i had never used a pizza stone but , thought they might be fun so , i put one on my registry i made pizza on the stone using store bought dough and got rave reviews from friends would definately reccomend this to a friend ! just remember to let the stone heat thoroughly before using
i purchased this machine for my father , who is completely blind , but a complete coffee fiend he finds this machine easy to use , and loves the fact that he can make as many or as few cups i highly recommend this machine
heavy duty and scratch resistant \( my husband always tests this with his house key \) good value for the money
i just received my jiffy steamer j 4000 pro line it was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words use enclosed funnel in caps every where i sent an email and they said they will send me one \( they seem to have a good customer service \)

this is a perfect machine for the office it takes up very little space , is very simple to use , cleaning is a breeze
i ordered all three colors of these mugs red , blue and white the blue and white mugs have a shiny , even glaze the red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish , giving it a more rustic , country look the mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really do n't match each other
works well , well built and easy to clean have no problems after a few months of use
i have used this filter daily for over a year and love it at first i tried using it in a mr coffee style machine , but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if i made more than 2 cups
me being an avid coffee drinker i will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job for the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee i used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup i think more brewing is better sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item i spent more on starbucks in a week
this may sound odd , but this is the first steamer that i have ever had so needless to say , i do not have others to compare it to however , i find that i use it more than i thought i would ! the unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that i most use for vegies and the like , and when i pull out the sides \( the steaming tray \) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot besides your basic steamed vegies , i find that it 's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice , leaving it hot and fluffy i like that the handle extends , so you can keep the cover on it while cooking , but you can extend the handle for easier lifting and you ca n't beat the price
so i read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this and was skeptical there were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air tight seal mine work perfectly ! they are invaluable and i'm glad i bought two of these canisters are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher \? if so , stop it ! the intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic do you have an old model vacuum sealer \? maybe that 's the problem a performance issue i have the newer stainless steel v2860 and you could n't pry that out of my hands ! i would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating
at first i thought i would n't be able to decide what to use this for , but right away i remembered that i just bought a six pack of onion rolls and they always seemed to have to be frozen and were just not the same later or went moldy in the fridge , so i vacuum sealed them in this and they were good to the last one with no flavor change at all yummy ! 7
i love this wok heavy duty compared to woks you buy at oriental stores i highly recommend it
at first i was turned off by the bright \( gaudy \) colors however , i have learned to appreciate that these knives are color coded ! they stand out in the knife drawer , and you can always find the one you are looking for consequently , the right knife is used to get the job done
i have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier they have excellent balance and feel a major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the calphalon 15 piece set the wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice \( light pine with no finish \) , but i do n't use it anyway
delighted to have it for my wood floors , tile and area rugs works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non organic detritus that collects does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly gosh darn ! so much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down , when i want to change areas being cleaned again , gosh darn ! ca n't totally eliminate all the work , no matter how much i might like to
this dutch oven is a workhorse in my kitchen i purchased it pre seasoned because i 've never had a factory seasoned piece of cast iron cookware bottom line while the pre seasoning was a plus , it 's not necessary just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the lodge cookware , and you 'll be fine
this is the second one of these i 've purchased \( the first was a thermos branded one without the cover \) it keeps my can of soda , etc cold throughout and adds a touch of class to keeping it on my desk both of these are very rugged and i would highly recommend over a standard foam cooler absolutely the most functional , effective , and classy cooler i 've ever had !
the nissan multi function can insulator is a lightweight versatile stainless steel holder that effectively keeps canned beverages cold my mother and i find the product allows our soft drinks to remain cold after more than two hours i have two conveniently stored in the center console of my automobile , 1 at the office , and 1 in my luggage for travel
just used my pan last night and as always with lodge logic pans they were awesome ! i highly recommend them
i'm sure that you will love this set as much as my family and i do !
when we got married 7 years ago , we were given a hand mixer of another brand \( sunbeam , i think \) that had seven \( or was it nine \? \) speeds and lots of different attachments \( dough hook , wisk , etc , none of wich worked well \) i have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months , and i had n't even mixed anything heavy with it ! i always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor \( my mom had burnt through several mixers \)
i have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually have n't gotten another for the past 6 years i 've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster it 's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but i'm sure braun is cringing if they read this ! i love the little pull out tray , you do n't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death ! the toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem it is fast too , so you wo n't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster i think you will be pleased with this great toaster , i am
the braun ht500 is one of the best designed toasters i have ever used what i really like
great blender ! i use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails powerful motor purees frozen fruits great ! ! simple only two speeds easy clean up
i have only used this blender once , but already i love it i will update my review if anything changes no more cheapo blenders for me ! i have tried oster \( really bad \) , and black and decker from walmart \( a tad better , but it did n't work on frozen fruit and ice \)
the temperature readings were spot on
this ice cream maker is great the fact that i can use an industrial motor \( my kitchen aid mixer \) is fantastic it is my belief that the ice cream maker itself is as near perfect as you can get , contrary to other reviews if you read the description and instructions , you will find that it is not the biggest maker on the market and that it does exactly what it says it will it makes great ice cream
i love this pan as for cooking this pan does a great job on steaks , burgers , chicken , whatever leaves really nice grill marks the only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it i use a 16 round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range this seems to work just find for me
the diadem cooking set roughly meets the wmf criteria , though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top the products are made im china at first i thought something was wrong , then i looked at the wmf site and indeed they have a factury in china , so they must be genuine , however , i think amazon should clearly state if they are made in china or germany , i ordered another wmf kettle last week , made in germany and i think there is a differenc
i did not find a problem with the balance , as previously mentioned by another reviewer the only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is , that if they are planning on tossing their food , they had better be strong because this unit is heavy ! other than that , it proves to be very useful for large portions it heats quickly , heats evenly , holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir yes , it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides the purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well now keep in mind , there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top , flat top or coil range true frying ala asian style is done on an open flame !
calphalon katana knives excel in balance , efficient design , sharpness , and in good looks i look forward to using them every time i prepare food
this is simply the best pan i own if you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot , you wo n't have a problem with sticking it 's easy to use , easy to clean , works for just about everything \( except maybe making pancakes for which you would want a non stick griddle \) i just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it love it
reliable , easy to use , rice always comes out perfectly , no burning , easy to clean what more could you ask of a rice cooker
le creuset 's grills , woks , and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be seasoned like tradiitonal cast iron there are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan , the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes let the pan cool , remove the oil with a paper towel , and repeat two or three times a surface patina builds up that is quite non stick from now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel in the case of burned on food , a brief soak in soapy water works well as the pan is used the patina continues to build le creuset 's omelete pans do come with silverstone non stick if you like non stick the textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non stick coating i own a le creuset wok , a square grill pan , and three frying pans with this textured finish and i find that they work fine after being seasoned this way i also own a le creuset omlete pan that has a good non stick coating this pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations the textured finish pans work well for grilling meats , stir fries , and other hardier preparations if you use good non scratch silicone or nylon tools in your le creuset wares and a small amout of pam or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems
this is a super convenient item i do n't lock it so messing with the lock is not an issue the lock could probably be a little more user friendly it stores everything just great it keeps the dust off of my cuisinart goodies i have another three blade disc holder too that one came with my cuisinart this one is a must have
i am glad that i finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp cuisinart blades i have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried the only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place i knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children
i got this as a gift from my mother when i moved to my first apartment away from home she already had one , and loved it i use mine quite frequently , and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers my brother and father have also since purchased these units i have had mine going on 5 years now , not a problem with it great value , good gift for cooks for one or two , who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff
my mother in law got me one of these when i started feeding my first son baby food before , i would just mash up our food with a fork this is much easier i 've had it for three years now and it 's still working great
heads and tails above my 8 year old hoover wind tunnel bagged unit never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week \( adds up to big bucks quickly \)
i received this tea kettle as a replacement for a nova teakettle \( the former model \) that i purchased in october 2005
this electric water heater feels very solid and well built when filled to 1 7 liters , it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil the kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished i thought this would be annoying , but it is not ! also , when switched on , there is a nice white led lighting up the water supply making it easy to read
i love this fryer ! its just the right size for my kitchen its not big and bulky like other fryers its easy to clean too its a winner in my book
i knew going in that these were not thick , but i am pleased with these sheets would i buy them again \? yes , aslong as the price is as low as i got them for \( under 20 bucks \)
these sheets are soft wash well and set the pace for a great night 's sleep i love flannel sheets and these are the best so far

i ordered this item when it was not available at that time so it took a while for me to get it but i was impressed at the careful packing and the product itself very elegant looking cake set and can be used as a punch bowl too would certainly recommend it for all hosts
i recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago it 's very heavy and well made it came boxed extra well the box was inside another box surrounded by air bags there was no way this thing was going to be broken i am happy with my purchase
lodge logic has exploded from a small corner shop in one lonely town in vermont , to a nationwide powerhouse ready and eager to bust down to the door to your house and fill your kitchen with finest in waffle press technology i'm of course referring to the cutting edge finnish design that lodge has presented here i'm able to pretty much press out an entire course of breakfast in well under an hour with this thing , easily producing a feast fit for the third reich

ok , this is obviously not the same as the traditional all clad stockpots , if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one it is part of the disk bottom collection , however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made i certainly would not consider it secondary it is a little lighter in weight than the traditional all clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means it is great for sauce , soup , stew , etc you will love it and you ca n't beat the price it is very easy to clean a
this cover is very rich looking the fabric is wonderful i have a kitten that was pulling himself onto the bed and snagging it , but i just snipped the snags and you cannot tell it is easy to wash and looks great on the bed

i searched for years trying to find a nice , plain white butter dish this one is perfect it blends in well with all my other dishes it is study , attractive , and holds a stick of butter what more could you ask of a butter dish
fiestaware rocks a few years back , i started my fiestaware collection the butter dish , in turquoise , was a recent addition i like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful , eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme it is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well i am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful , they are individual pieces of art !
this grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen it 's very solidly built , unlike the old ones i have , and the non skid base is pure genius the grating surface is nice and sharp i love the container that catches whatever you 've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid although the container faithfully catches the grated material , there will be some spillage from the outside of the grater especially with cheese one caveat since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use , you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating yup , i realized this the hard way , and boy was it a mess ! despite this , i highly recommend this kitchen essential
this set has 29 tips , a flower nail and one coupler in a plastic case all the tips and more to decorate just about any cake you would make
this knife works nicely the blades have remained sharp after carving roasted chicken and turkey , roast beef , and yes even cakes over the past year
this is a very nice set of small measuring spoons excellent for measuring baking soda , salt , etc for recipes they are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores this set also comes with 2 things not shown , a nice ring to loop these together , as well as a matching s hook to hang them up when not in use i really like this set and would recommend this to everyone
this toastmaster breadmaker is pretty basic , makes a good sized loaf and is really easy to use if the first loaf is n't perfect , the troubleshooting section of the book tells you how to correct the problems and the corrections work
had i known what a difference this would make with my cooking , i would have bought one a long time ago everything is faster , now , and everything i mix , from potatoes to icing , comes out smoother , too
the kitchenaid professional 5 plus \( kv25g0x \) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere we ordered it from amazon , and got the commercial \( km25g0x \) instead we did not want that , so contacted customer service they said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another km25g0x no good , obviously then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise they said they sometimes substituted similar products great

i purchased this mug for my wife as a christmas gift she just loves it she useds almost everyday it has been 4 months now and as good as new
these pans are great , nothing sticks to them i baked a pie , set on top of the pan , and the burnt overflow stuff just slid right off
these sheets are wonderful and very well made i really like they way they feel great , great value !
great price for beautiful , high quality sheets that get softer with every wash fabulous color ! sheets fit well over a mattress with pillow top recommend 100
ok , for twenty bucks it works reasonably well we like the storage container to hold the attachments but if you 're looking for a lower speed to blend ingredients like flour or pancake mix , buy something else the 1 speed setting is way too fast anything higher than 4 will decorate your kitchen walls at no extra charge
i cook for a family of 5
i love this spatula when it comes to getting the last bit of dough or sauce out of the bottom of a bowl , it 's perfect the soft silicone head easily contours itself to the bottom of the bowl to get every last bit it 's also incredibly stick free i made fondue last night and after pouring it all into the serving dish , i wiped the cheese off the spoon with a finger , rinsed it , and it was clean ! it is also incredibly heat resistent my household has a lot of spatulas with burn marks all along the handle from resting on the side of a pot on the stove i 've had this spatula for over two years and it 's still burn free i love it
cleaning up is so easy now the other roaster pan we used would allow the juices to bake on and it you would have to soak it , scrub it and scrape it i love this stuff !
this is one great tool i have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items i like the spade better since i love ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker the style is great and the functionality is superb now that kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets , i am finding myself getting all new sorts of items i never knew i wanted or needed i'm even replacing other brands of tools with kitchenaid ones
super easy to use , put in rice and water out comes perfect rice every time have n't experimented with any rice cooking recipes yet but it makes incredible white and brown rice with no though
just go for new shaped cookies , these cutters are great and so simple to use
the only reason i bought this is because i visited my sister over the holiday season and she had one and i liked it i liked it even more after i bought it nice toaster ! !
its the perfect size pan and easy to clean i 've cooked thai stayle chicken satay sticks and salmon on it and it makes those awesome grill lines i love using this pan its so much easier faster than using then firing up the outdoor grill
this handheld vac works great there is awesome suction and longevity i had two dustbusters that did n't come close so i am now a convert only complaint is the stand used for charging it 's not easy to push vacuum into just the right spot
this vacuum is rather good it meets or exceeds the dustbuster versions i 've got only one gripe , and that 's the base it is n't exactly easy to put on and take off
i have used different brands of dust busters but this one by far has out done them the battery lasts and the power is very good also shipping was prompt nothing else i can add all over very good thank you , i shall return a f island par
i have bought over 6 of these for friends and family , everyone that sees it , has to have one , we make alot of our own jewelry , so we have plenty of bracelets and earrings this keeps it organized so you can match colors to the outfit you are wearing it is the best ! very good quality too
i am happy with the product quality and with the prompt delivery
this grill is awesome ! i ordered it to replace my old grill , which did n't have the removeable plates and was worn down the removeable grills make this so easy to clean maybe takes 5 minutes i had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers , and though this one was more expensive , i thought it had a better design than some of the others i looked it definitely recommended , do n't hesitate to buy this if you 're thinking about it
i bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago it arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with it 's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean so far i have only cooked whole chickens , chicken pieces , shishkabobs , and sausages if i only ever used it to just cook chicken , it 's still a great price if you can follow simple instructions , you ca n't go wrong with this
when i was searching for something to simplify my life i came upon this product i thought i would give it a try as i love egg mcmuffins it is everything i dreamed of and more easy , convient , done in less than five minutes and a breeze to clean up i love it and ca n't stop telling family and friends about it i hope you enjoy it as much as i have
this is great for making poached eggs on toast my family has enjoyed using it so far
my cats absolutely love this fountain it works great , and takes very little to keep clean the resovoir is a must though
like many homemakers , i generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house my husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods i went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing these magnetic curtain rods solved that problem the rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts the holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door the curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains i installed the set in a moment 's time with very little effort my husband was surprised and thrilled that i found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door
i saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one that was several years ago finally , our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky so , i promptly bought another one morning is just not the same without our brewstation
tried this on my favorite but often dull chefs knife and after 4 6 strokes was very very sharp works great as promised casing cheap so not sure how long that will last or if it will hamper it 's operation compact , stores well , would be great for motor home or other small kitchen for 29 , makes me wonder what the 99 version does that amazon also carries knocked a star off for the cheap plastic case
3 swipes and your knife is sharp on both sides of the edge the sharpener folds up neatly into a little case the size of a man 's wallet and is easy to store the handy house ships immediately i got my package within 3 days i love the knife sharpener , and love the service i received thank
i bought this knife sharpener because i was tired of knives that would not cut the vender i brought it from , the handy house , told me that it worked and i had bought things from her before on her word and it works my knifes are old dull a few swips through the sharpener blade i had a brand new knife the price is also good
these spoons are great they are very sturdy and easy to use , and the finish on the metal is a nice touch overall , practical and attractive
this set of knives is simply incredible a must for any kitchen , especially a small one or if you just do a lot of quick small tasks these things are sharp , and , as standard for henckels , supremely made
i know that purists do n't like serrated knives , but these are great ! the weight of these knives is perfect they feel like very expensive utensils the chef 's knife is rarely out of my hand , and the block makes the whole set very handy
was thrilled to find pieces to replace ones mistakenly thrown out , rather than have to buy another blender the only drawback is the cover is white and my blender is black
this set of blender accessories was just what i needed to update my old blender seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all
this is my first le creuset casserole when i first received it , it was smaller than i was expecting but after cooking with it couple times , i really fall in love with it ! now i always clean it after using , and have it on my stove top in the kitchen ! it 's so cute and fun
this is probably the most used tool in my kitchen the cost of the machine and bag material are more than repaid in food savings i like the rolls as opposed to the bags because i can make the size i need without waste watch for sales on meat or fish buy large quantities at reduced cost , and cut your bags to a portion size , vacuum and seal , and freeze i have taken hamburger , steaks , fish , pork , and chicken out of the freezer after being stored for two years or longer , and they are as fresh as the day i put them in
i got this pan set a few years ago i love making checkerboard cakes they are so simple with this set you can use boxed mixes , but i find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design
jeez , everyone , yea , they cost a buck each , ok , a buck ! but they can be reused , how often do you go to the dollar store and spend a buck on a totally usless piece of something that breaks as soon as you bring it home , hmmm \? or you buy a pack of paper plates and they are gone in a couple of weeks \? \? well , at least these are serving a purpose , and are reusable i do n't have to scoop anymore , and i have 2 cats , i change it maybe every 3rd day , and it 's not a chore , takes less than a minute , less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there , and speaking of , i do not smell their poop at all till it 's changed so i'm happy and i think it 's more than worth it !
we were more than pleased with our purchase of this item , and it arrived sooner than expected
for the money this is a way for the novice cook to experience the quality of wustof this knife went into my daughter in law 's stocking for christmas and was a great hit
my old blender went kaput it was a kenmore we decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor
this is a jewel takes the skin off nice and clean just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches just bought 6 more for family and friends
this is a great shredder absolutly the best out there it is a lousy slicer take the bad with the good i guess
first , the good stuff this peeler is sharp , requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable i like having it , but i'm also holding on to my cheap little oxo peeler for a couple of reasons first , the rosle produces very thick peels , which is a bit wasteful second , i tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me the rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right handed and left handed peeler that said , i do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction , which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason , one pan may look like another , but each is unique in its own way
this pot rocks you 'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it it browns well , cleans easily , and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style
this product is great for making mashed potatoes i love it , it is well made and sturdy my kids like to turn the handle and i do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers the price is very good for this item i prefer non electric kitchen gadgets , \( to save space \) and this one is great
i used the four large slider discs to move an 8' x 10' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad \( after building the mini barn painting it \) the move placed it against the fence it was n't easy , but they did the job and the slider discs are still useable though scratched up
i like the amazon customer service as they replaced my order when i got the damaged one
le creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron chinese styled wok it looks like a chinese wok , and it is made of iron , but essentially it is not chinese
i 've stir fried in this pan quite a few meals , including carmelizing onions with soy sauce when used with medium heat , cleaning is very easy soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works i 've done this also with high heat , it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new
regarding the glue issue the cutting board came to me as described in lisa dryer 's review below shrink wrapped in plastic however , the product 's label was adhered to the surface of the cutting board with a big glob of what appears to be that clear sticky stuff they use to hold inserts in magazines , etc and it adheres to bamboo , for sure i managed to get most of it off , but a thin layer remains i figure that goof off or some other solvent would get rid of it , but i do n't want to put poison on something that 'll be holding my food
we have been using these for several years now for refrigerator storage and reheating , we use these containers almost daily i remember the lids were a bit stiff at first , but not impossible unless you are over 80
so far i have made several different ice creams in my new machine this is the first i 'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you do n't the machine is very efficient you just put the mixture in and it does all the work you may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others you just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency i made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it did n't thicken and i wasted all of it , so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine the machine is a little noisy but i expected that after reading about it , not as bad as i thought it would be though overall , very happy
it was the perfect price and the cheapest that i found anywhere and i would recomend it to anyone
this color of fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection my sister in law , for whom this was a gift , just loves it and i 'd be tempted to buy a set for myself if i did n't already have a ton of dishes the fiesta line are all well made , solid dishes that can be used for all occasions if you know someone needing dishes , the fiesta line is the way to go these dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table
i looked for somewhere to find these corelle plates and found them on amazon my favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse
this plate , the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate , just so you know it 's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes my aunt has had the winter frost white as long as i can remember , and now i am slowly building my own collection i love them they are very light and strong i tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact the material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds they are so thin and light that i could probably carry at least 35 of them this is perfect for your everyday meals highly recommended
the combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone both i and my parents have been using corelle dinnerware for over 15 years , and are amazed at how well they hold up
pretty good product we have not changed the batteries yet it does get quite a bit of usage it 's easy to use not an eye sore in my kitchen very fast shipping ! i would order again
i recently received this pan as a gift , and have been extremely impressed with it ! the infused anodized surface performs as advertised , providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non stick cooking i love the 14 size it 's great for those times when i used to have to split things up into more than one 10 saute pan , as well as for one pan stovetop to oven dishes
this is one of my favorite knives and i have quite a collection of them , believe me it 's sturdy , sharpens easily , and seems to contour to my hand when chopping i'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife great price , i might add this brand across the board is one of my all time favorites i 've never been disappointed with a knife i purchased from victorinox
the food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase i know i was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it 's an excellent food processor and worth more than the money my wife loves you know guys waht that means also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow the seller was more than excellent
this low cost loaf pan does everything you would expect a loaf pan to do it 's dark color absorbs enough heat to produce desired browning it also releases cleanly the protruding lips serve as handles \( although if they were a little bigger they 'd be easier to grip while wearing oven mitts \) all in all , this is an excellent buy for a loaf pan you should buy two since many recipes call for making two loaves

these bags and all of the foodsaver brand bags are flawless the only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong if you do ebay you can get these same 32 count gallon bags for about 10 99 5 50 for shipping and sometimes you can find a seller that will combine shipping for multiple boxes i purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for 32 97 9 00 for shipping also keep in mind that you can wash and re use these bags as long as they did not hold any kind of meat and that they have never been boiled i have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob
solidly built with easy to read numbers looks like it will last a long time although it was a little pricey
i 've only had this thermometer for about a week , but so far , it does exactly what it 's supposed to stays in place at the back of the oven and displays the temperature using numbers large enough that i can read them easily without opening the oven door very satisfied
ok so i got this set for free , but i would have paid something for it the little peeler works fine but the parer is n't the sharpest knife in my knife block i 've attempted to sharpen it but it does n't hold an edge well
i suppose color choices would be nice choice is almost always good but my smaller golden loves it she likes the view it gives her and it 's room and she does n't paw at the sides my larger golden \( 118 lbs and no he 's not fat he 's just a tall , tall golden \) would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate she thinks is very cool and i like the weight of it for being prepared to hit the road when the next hurricane is announced he has a big folding metal crate and that suits him
what you see is what you get it works just fine , there is n't really much that could go wrong the only thing is i should have gotten the larger size what they call a cup and what i call a cup did n't really measure up for me it makes two regular mugs
this teapot was a good buy all in all it 's true about how the leaves container does n't stay in a static position this concerned me at first , but it has n't been a problem the tea press will slide down over time without leaves in the pot , i put it in the leaves container on an angle and this stops that from happening i have never had a problem loosing heat to fast from this pot , contrary to previous reviews yeah , some things could be better quality but considering the price i 'd call it a good buy
i think you could do just about anything to this bottle opener and it would come out just fine as noted by other reviewers , this opener has a wonderful substantial weight it has kitchenaid 's signature quality and great color ! goes well with my other utencils and gadgets oh , it opens bottles very well too
all the hype is true the sensations are sinful , but totally legal i'm still embarrassed that i spent that much money on a dessert maker , but i do n't regret a penny of it when i clean the machine , i only wish i had a tongue long enough to lap up every drop i hide from the kids so i can lick the paddle blades alone
i 've had this cookware since 1991 it has performed exactly as promised regardless of all the use \( this is the hardest working piece in the set \) it 's in great shape i use it for so many things , sauteing vegetables , a large omelette \( to share \)
so far our food processor has been great we bought it to make our own baby food , and since then we have used it to make many other things as well i'm very happy with it
these scissors are ideal for the kitchen the size is nice , good grips fit well in the hand they are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future
these shears are indispensable first they are sharp and stay that way definitely not to be used by children they will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves \( but i spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone \) easy to handle but best of all , they come apart and go back together with extreme ease , yet stay together for use contrary to the description , it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart they are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for cleaning with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way the cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening you 'll wonder how you ever got along without them
i just love fiestaware and this is the perfect chili bowl ! it is a great size for chili or soup ! the quality is fantastic adn the price was very good
this item was ordered to replace a kitchen aid unit used extensively for a number of years i am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients i first heard of the delonghi mixer when it was branded kenwood in an australian magazine
i was a kitchenaid fan i had the special edition 350 watt and burned the motor out twice in just a couple of years when it burned out the 2nd time i decided not to spend another 100 on repairs i bought this delonghi and love it
these dishes are beautiful and very nice quality , i will be buying more
if you like your friday cocktail , and enjoy having people over to enjoy it with you , then get an ice bucket and some tongs i purchased this one when my old one rusted out and like it much better it 's just classy enough , without seeming snooty , and holds a nice amount of ice just fill it , stick it on your bar or table , and then you do n't have to worry about continually opening up the freezer
i love this dutch oven do n't even debate whether or not you should buy it just buy it you will not regret it i'm consistently amazed at how well food turns out after cooking in it after buying it i tend to use it in place of my all clad pieces amazing
i absolutely love this cookware do n't be put off by the seemingly high price you will hand this stuff down to your kids what 's so special about it \? it out performs all of my other cookware \( yes , even all clad \) on the stovetop and in the oven the even heating is better than i could have imagined it will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops and , as an added bonus , it 's the easiest to clean i use mine for most everything pot roast , soup , stew , pasta sauces , braising , slow cooking , etc it 's great
this stockpot is the best of all the visions offerings the worst being the skillet
i find this timer very easy to use i'm not a rocket scientist
i received this item last week and immediately tried it it was easy to use and worked quite fast needed much less marinating juice to get the job done i wish it was also available in a bigger size for a larger group
use it keep to store and keep food fresh as wel
i only use the brisk brew for heating water while on vacation i'm a tea drinker my ex husband got custody of the first one we bought , so the search was on when i could n't find it in the stores i went on line as soon as i saw the exact same i ordered it it works great , and travels light !
having now owned this device for three months , i found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there is n't any or no way to get any its lightweight , very portable and compact while listed as a coffee maker , it brewed very slowly and not all that well but as a hot water heater , it served fantastically well the typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4 5 minutes , so little patience is needed the device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses
this baster is big enough to accomplish most tasks , and it even makes a great costume accessory on halloween except that when i used it as part of my halloween party costume along with a doctor 's lab coat and stethoscope , all the women blushed and left the room oh well , maybe next time i 'll come as a proctologist
i have le creuset and calphalon pots and pans but i find myself constantly reaching for this farberware pot the design is why i bought it i would have been willing to pay 100 for one just like it from calphalon or le creuset but this is the only one of its kind i could find anywhere online
i bought this as a birthday gift to myself and i love it i thought i would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee , but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor the taste is unbeatable ! even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter highly recommended for coffee lovers !
this is an outstanding device in several i 've had before the cutter blades were not fastened to the center piece they would flex as the coring progressed and the slices would be rendered a mess this corer has rigidly attached blades and therefore cuts clean , perfect slices every time
this casserole dish has some minor inconveniences it 's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it 's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand i also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones it does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what i need it for
le creuset baking dishes are an investment in good cooking for a lifetime this 11 1 2 inch size oval dish is similar in size and shape to a medium sized au gratin it is large enough to bake two large fish fillets or four boneless chicken breasts or a casserole many times , i double a casserole recipe and put half in this dish and then freeze it for later use i bring the dish right from the oven to the table for serving , and i find its clean up is easy afterward
the only complaint from the other reviews that i can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control i certainly do n't have any trouble getting hot milk my taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated , but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as i 've had in america
when my braun flavorselect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working , i had to scramble to find a new machine i wanted another braun , but unfortunately , they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker so i had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features i wanted combined with good value i finally found it with this cuisinart model
this pan heats up evenly , no hot or cool spots , and the handles stay cool it 's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to high , and so far , it has n't been necessary very good value
i have been using a cuisinart 9 skillet for a few years now and love it one of the best pans i 've ever owned \( and i 've owned a few top names too \) but when my 13 stainless steel skillet \( from another name \) warped under too much heat \( it could n't take the heat from my viking range \) , i immediately started a search for a cusinart replacement i could n't believe the price fortunately i have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart does n't come with one
works very well only drawback it 's large but stands upright
the kitchenaid professional 5 plus \( kv25g0x \) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere we ordered it from amazon , and got the commercial \( km25g0x \) instead we did not want that , so contacted customer service they said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another km25g0x no good , obviously then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise they said they sometimes substituted similar products great
i have enjoyed my new kitchenaid i'm thinking that i may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter , as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater overall , i am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time
the cirtus juicer works great \( like all kitchen aid products \) but it 's pricy by the time you pay 8 to ship it however my local outlet mall wanted over 30 for it plus tax
i received these as a christmas gift and am very pleased with them they are very thin so it makes gripping things out of the oven a lot easier than with thick mitts and they 'll take up less room in your drawer highly recommend worth the extra money
this was purchased as a wedding present i do not yet know what the couple thinks of it but it is the one they requested
you know , for this price , you could throw anything away but , this 'synthetic' comforter is so soft , silky and light , i can toss it on and not feel weighted down i also have a cat and with cat hairs i can vacumn them off easily \( down is more difficult \) , but just having the airy warmth is worth it
i 've used this set for several years now and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives even though i also own global and shun kitchen knives , i find myself being drawn to the insignia knives when i am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project although both the global and the shun have sharper edges , their price difference does n't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get that is to say , yes global and shun knives are sharper , but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that
my living room \( approx 12'x16' and open to the kitchen \) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day it sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it the bionaire bw2300 cools it in half the time it used to take
a long time krups customer , i purchased this blender after 10 years of suffering with a lack luster , non krups blender , which was given to me as a wedding present to say this is an outstanding blender would be an understatement i'm amazed with how quiet the blender is and the best feature is how powerful it is we use our blender for smoothies in the morning and my husband uses it for his nutrition drinks in the evenings , so we needed something that was durable , substantial and will last a long a time
this is the best cooling rack i have ever seen i have used it primarily for cookies , but it works great for other baked goods as well because of the small grid , nothing gets bent or broken the size is perfect for putting many cookies on to cool without trying to squeeze them together clean up is a breeze just add a couple of recipes and this would make a very nice gift i know i would n't want to be without it
i love this vacuum ! it is great for doing quick jobs around the house , vacuuming the stairs and vacuuming up the lint in the laundry room i would highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone i love that you can use it like a dustbuster to clean to car or use the long arm to do regular cleaning
i purchased this knife because my daughter did n't like using any of my knives she wanted one like the chefs all use on food network i was n't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise , and i'm pleased with it it 's nice looking , feels comfortable to hold , works well for chopping vegetables overall , a decent knife at a very reasonable price
this is truely a professional grater does a great job with hard cheeses and chocolate , etc looks and feels great in the hand , and is impressive to have on the table for your dinner guests to grate their own parmesan
i love these pans i got the set for a wedding gift last year but needed another saucepan , so this was perfect this one is a little larger than the 2 pans in the set i absolutely love the set the pans heat up very quickly and clean up beautifully they 're less expensive than many of the gourmet sets but just as good
i purchased this product for two reasons i own other cuisinart cookware and like it very much secondly , i frequently make spaghetti sauce with meatballs and find that a 3 quart saucepan just is n't large enough the 4 quart size is perfect for some reason i ca n't explain , my sauce tastes much better made in this saucepan
i'm really glad to have replaced my non stick with the cuisinart pans i have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non stick i was really scared that they would stick and i would have to scrub them , but they 've been really good so far i'm not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside , but i know it 's because i cook on med high heat and i need to get some barkeeper 's friend overall , really pleased with this purchase , and i'm still adding to my set
this is my third salad shooter in the past 20 or so years would n't be without one ! it 's great
i carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so i would know what to expect they mostly said the same thing either it broke or it worked perfectly the consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses , and do n't overcrank the handle we have only used it for parmesan cheese , and so far we 've had no problems it works great so far
right out of the box and with skim milk , i have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar easy to set up , easy to use , easy to clean can i ask for more \? what else is there
i am replacing the same product that i have used continually for the past nine years or so it has been an indispensable part of our kitchen all those years and we hope this new one will continue the tradition
the petstep ii multi purpose dog sately ramp was perfect for getting my black lab , blake , out of the water and over our sea wall he is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight he is very appreciative and so am i !
i have used mine for over a year now i will never buy anything except this line of cookware in the future never sticks , easy to clean , after a year of everyday use \( family of 6 \) it 's still in good shape ! note we only clean it with a dobie pad as directed ! large enough to do four american toast at the same time great heat distribution just great , and big ! gave it to some friends as a present , they love it too glad i found it in this lifetime ! get it i think you 'll love it too ! and no , i have no affiliation with calaphon
this combo is awesome ! i 've used coconut oil \( very little it does n't burn or smoke when heated \) to season it and the press gets better with each use i use olive oil for the meat or bread i'm cooking and , although a steak was n't seared as much as i would have liked , the pannini are outstanding the coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that i 've correctly seasoned a pan residue now just slips off with hot water and a natural bristled brush please read the use and care instructions i do n't usually but for some reason sat down and did you will find them very informative i love it
when i bought this thing 3 years ago i thought i might do kabobs on it but not only does it cook kabobs beautifully it also cooks tandoori chicken and tandoori bread !
like the other reviewers , i have a cat who previously showed little to no interest in cat items until i put this out it 's now his regular spot to nap , and lounge
i love my vienna deluxe ! we 've been using it for 4 8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop if you plan to buy more than 100 coffees \( for us about 3 months worth \) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better the flavor of the coffee is awesome and it 's super easy to make
this pan is very easy to clean however , the small base wo n't sit stably on my gas range i keep a hand on the handle and pay attention to how it sits on the range to overcome the problem
i hav k5ss model of the kitchen aid mixer and it has worked well for me when i do my cookies , cakes or mix ground meat for meat loaf it is very easy and convenient to use
i do n't think these are the highest quality sheet you will ever find as it has some thread coming out of the hem after a couple washes with that said , for the price , the sheets are very nice and feel soft after a couple washes
i ca n't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is it makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes , then , you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl , which you can then mix the batter in the bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy , but it just plain works really well
these pans are mahvelous , dahling having said that , i 've read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans to one , to all there is a product called goo gone that is designed for just this type of thing you can find it almost anywhere , hardware stores , grocery stores , etc it works in minutes , and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind just be sure the wash the pan afterwards happy adhesive free baking
these bags are durable and work everytime i like the size which seems hard to find locally
i like this a lot it is very compact and easy to use i like the built in ice strainer you just slip off the cap and pour no hassles of the top jamming and having to beat it open with a knife you will need a finer strainer if you want to filter out citrus pulp , for example but for most cocktails you are just straining out the ice but i like this one for it 's convenience
this machine is really a great invention especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip \( for example , infusing the tea for too long \) i think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine the design is great quite classy , and i think it will be great for entertaining \( loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well designed tea pot and cups \) here is how it worked for me
the kitchenaid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect they are very will made and excellent quality the silicone material is amazing , it is so easy to clean , whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix , cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it the curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the kitchenaid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my all clad mixing bowls with this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl highly recommended
this tea pot , like their french press coffee pot , is made of `magic glass' it does n't seem to break i'm hard on things and usually need heavy duty models just for every day survival i 've had this tea pot for maybe 8 years unheard of for things around me the glass just does n't seem to break others have spoken about how you use it to make tea a brilliant idea but here 's the other cool thing when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say , a sea shell tea like peets com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it you can see the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does
i have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best ! heavy \( but not too heavy to use \) so the handles do n't bend \( or float around in the dishwasher \) , shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily , easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away \( they are engraved \) i love my set will definately buy another set \( cooking is my hobby \)
fantastic , works perfectly , easy to clean , much more sanitary than a n old fashioned bristle brush also gentler on the pastries or breads
boy , do i love this piece ! i got mine for a lot less at an outlet store and it 's just wonderful i love the purple color it 's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table it does wonderfully in the oven it 's not overly big so do n't get it to feed a family of 5 or so it 's about 1 5 quarts i get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple , well , it 's just original and if you 're afraid of it , do n't be it 's just a gorgeous color and one that i'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen i'm getting more ! highly recommended piece
this is the best spatula i have ever owned , and i have owned entirely too many it is strong and wide and slightly curved at the front edge to fit my pans the front edge is also nice and thin so it slides right under any food and it cleans up like magic no holes for junk to get stuck in and you can rest it right on the skillet without it melting or lay it on the counter because the handle is curved in such a manner as to keep the head from resting on the countertop seriously the best spatula ever
this tool makes even the toughest jar a breeze to open , accommodating a range of sizes easily i'm sending one to everyone in my family this christmas
finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to oxo i love their good grips products all the handles look great , but are also very comfortable and practical this strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people you can use this double rod strainer not only for straining , but also for sifting flour , draining , and if need be awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water
read the reviews and ordered
i immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as i took it out of the box very nice looking very easy to cook in it 's big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it the non stick surface works beautifully reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100 correctly into place without a little hassle i'm not sure it really matters if it 's not perfectly 100 aligned into the base anyway nevertheless , that 's only a minor gripe this wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good the included spatula was a nice gesture , too the instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too , like slow cooking , but i only use it for stir fry
these glasses do work and in much more distinct way that i could have ever imagined i have bought many riedel glasses to my wine lover friends and they absolutely love it too you got to try them to believe it you wo n't regret it
this pot is a perfect medium sized saucepan the double handles are a great feature we use it at least once a day in our kitchen the non stick surface is extremely durable , although i'm not sure i would use metal utensils with it i use a blue scrub sponge to clean it i'm not sure i would use the more abrasive , green 3m pads overall a very durable , high quality cooking utensil in fact i'm back here today to buy one for a friend
i love having these pyrex cups in varying sizes the large ones are great for mixing and pouring batter , like pancakes the smaller one let 's you measure once , to get 1 1 2 or 2 cups of liquid
ok , it 's june and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds no need to feel depressed you can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up , knowing you gave something that wo n't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride
best iron i ever owned i read the reviews before purchasing and was not disappointed no one likes to iron , but this one makes it a little easier
very sturdy construction and i like the glass lid the only problem i have is the lid has a very thin metal that is easily damaged the pot is thick and the handles are riveted on and very solid as long as you are careful with the lid , this steamer is awesome
i had traditionally used pyrex cake pans and was n't completely satisfied with the results just recently , i purchased the airbake cake pan after having successful results in their line of cookie sheets i am completely satisfied with this pan and recommend getting rid of the traditional pyrex
i love this shelf i have two you just take it out of the box and the shelves fall into place no screwdrivers , nothing to assemble its fabulous
i purchased the mix it in on 9 8 06 and used it the next day i never got soft serve i froze the bowl again , this time in my upright freezer , and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours
we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it it toasts consistently it accommodates all widths and the digital selector is great
i thought this set was cute in the picture , but was so excited when it actually came ! it is truly a beautiful set i have run them through the dishwasher a number of times already and they come out looking like new , and my husband loves the larger than normal size i have little hands i really like them too they are very sturdy the biggest bonus , other than the 8 settings plus the 5 piece serving set , is the extra 8 teaspoons !
you can depend upon pyrex to give you a great product use this cup for measuring all the time
i love this carafe no drips like others i have used ! the best part was how fast i recieved it amazon was so efficient i ordered it and before i knew it it was here ! !
the main problem with my bed was the featers were pocking me while i was sleeping no matter what i put on the top of the feather bed not anymore after i bought this magic cover
although small , these little cups come in really handy have small amounts of liquid to measure before you measure those tablespoons of sugar or flour \? now you do n't need to be concerned , just use a little oxo cup and move on ! i use them every time i bake and leave the measuring spoons dry or completely alone just love them and need another set
henkel pro s knives are second to none they will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking these knives take the 'chore' out of cutting vegis
the 8 chef 's knife is a little heavy , but other than that , they both work great so far especially for the price i 've used them daily for a month , and they have not lost their sharpness at all
henckels twin signature 7 piece block set is exactly what i 'd hoped that it would be a quality set of knives that is ideal for the home
a very solid knife set , especially with the extra slots for those who have a few favorite knifes left in the drawer make sure when you buy henckels to get the twin set instead of the single little henckel man , that 's a big upgrade in quality oh , and for goodness sake people , quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go
wonderful pan , but the handles get very warm since it is oven proof wish it was broiler proof
i did not realise how much i needed a new one till i got the new one
great product i am using this because my kitchen is under remodelling works great with smaller vessels heats up evenly i give 4 points because i am annoyed by the bulb on the stove it is on as long as the burner is connected to power i would rather have a burner which has bulb to show if the burner is on off
the french made roul'pat , like its cousin the silpat , is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin , fiberglass mesh for durability the roul'pat is designed for creating a non skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough the tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough , making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like because the mat is flexible , the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch dipped chocolates do n't stick , nor does fondant at sixteen and a half inches by twenty four , the surface is expansive enough for most recipes the only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it , ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife the manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface
i 've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken , fish and thick steaks it has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature , enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat i can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm as for clean up , the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that , everything comes off with relative ease no hard scrubbing involved overall , i love this product and highly recommend it
i purchashed the professional series tortilla baker ps75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet i grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding a loaf cost just about 15 cents i wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition i am very pleased with the results i grind my wheat , but leave out the oil because i submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking the machine really works , and its easy to use it a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen
this sturdy little fan has been working well for months one quibble its two speeds are medium fast there is no slow overall , i'm a happy customer
unit works great , heats up fast , easy to clean , and much better built than the typical discount store models it looks like this willlast a long time
i have used a revere teakettle for 41 years to clean it all you need to do is take some easy off oven cleaner \( spray type \) and spray the stainless steel part this cleans all the grease spatters and any other spatters you get on it leave the easy off on until you see that you can wipe off the stains wipe , rinse and dry it will look brand new
i love the function of these glasses we were given some of these bodum double wall glasses and immediately saw the quality difference they will not sweat , they will keep your cold stuff cold , etc i have two down sides these must be handled gently , they are not that thick or hearty until we realized what was going on , we cracked two by having our refigerator ice dispensor throw cubes into them , cracking them plus i yanked the dishwasher open fast , knocking one over into something solid , and it broke
while these are described as beer glasses , they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal i actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while i start dinner these glasses are easy to clean and retain their sunny shine , even though we have very hard water no spots ! great product
when you bake with the bavaria pan , you can be sure that the finished product is consistent in shape everytime the pan bakes evenly and there is a crispness of form when the cake is unmolded
i hope i never have to use it , but i have peace of mind , knowing it is in place
this is a light weight box fan that is very easy to move from place to place the remote feature is very convenient and it really helps keep the apartment cool
this tablemate is perfect for anybody it has many uses around the house which i could list but it would take to long it is sturdy enough to hold about 20 to 30 lbs when the tray is at its level position the 3 positions is a plus because it gives you more options the one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds down \( table top and the small bar other than the legs not folding this is a five star
i knew what i was buying , so there were n't any surprises the only thing i do not like about them is the shallowness i wanted that feature for storage , but i did n't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing i would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer i like them , and i would buy them again
i just adore silicone bakeware ! ! !
this pan works so great ! i have used it for cookies , biscuits , and pizza nothing has burned or stuck super easy to clean , you can wipe it off with a paper towel and stick it in the dishwasher or just rinse it with a sponge and soap and everything just slips right off great product !
this product has been great the price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store the only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive , it should be fine also , their is only one side door , does n't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have , but that did n't matter in our case this door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out for the price , it 's a great product
i bought it for my fiance and she loves it it 's great for frying chicken
purchased the toaster as a gift for my daughter 's family they love it with 2 kids and friends , the large capacity , sleek design , and perfect toasted bagels , keeps everyone happy get lots of positive comments from friends on how it looks and toasts !
i got a sunbeam hot shot about 6 years ago it had been recommended by someone at work i used it at work every day \( and still do \) and have since bought another for home it makes 2 cups of hot water and is great for everything including tea , instant oatmeal and hot chocolate when my daughter was younger , it was great for her because she could make her own hot chocolate or instant macaroni and cheese , and i would n't have to worry about her being burned on the hot stove with the hot shot , you just pour your water in the top and hit the heat button the machine will then shut itself off when the water is hot and you can dispense the water
we have had braun coffee pots for several years and have been happy with the coffee maker unfortunately , the two coffee makers that we had ordered from amazon had a persistent leaking problem unlike the exact same models that we have had in the past
this thermometer has been a great asset to me during the course of my employment at the bellagio in las vegas , as well as during my time as a student at le cordon bleu easy to use , full featured and very dependable , i have recommended this thermometer to many people and use it many times each day
first thing we cooked in this pan were burgers , and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried the raised ridges really carmelize the meat , and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy we have prepared chicken , pork chops and fish , and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled i would give this pan 10 stars if i could
i got this to use with the glorious one pot meals cookbook it has wonderful recipies , and the pot works wonderful cleans up really easy try it , you 'll love it
purchased these to go with a 7 inch henckels international santoku that i 've been using for years , and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all fine edge cutlery is good enough no , it is n't restaurant quality , and yes , if you put these through the dishwasher they 'll tarnish and probably even start to rust \( any metal designated as stainless is rust resistant rather than rust proof , and reviewers of other henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably are n't treating their knives very well \) as a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking , but does n't always have the time for it , these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening i 've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely and should probably be hand washed for longest life with that little bit of maintenance , however , this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs \( it meets all of mine , but then i do n't often dress poultry , filet my own fish , or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife \) for quite a nice price
after reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio , i went ahead and shelled out 100 for this i had really high expectation , having never spent so much for a heater before i have happy to say that i am completely satisfied this heater does n't overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat instead it circulates the heat over time \( you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room \) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots after spending some time in my room , i had completely forgotten how cold it was outside other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be my only minor complaint is that for its price , it should have included a remote control otherwise , it is a wonderful heater
you put cake mix in it and make cake this pan does just that yay
the litter box is good if you have a cat that does not scratch my cat sometimes tears up the box with her claws so i have to keep an eye on her and the box for leaking and holes other then that the chystals are excellent for odor
i have to say that i have tried almost all of the self cleaning litter boxes out there for my large male 14year old cat he has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water , so you know what that means , yes , he pees a lot oh yea he is a larger \( not fat \) kitty so he eats a lot also , i aint sayin no more on that subject
i bought this product back in july 2005 and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes it does a good job of it i cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as i try to stay away from that stuff the unit has a very solid construction the stainless steel glass is great i just drink my shake from it so it saves me from having to wash another glass i just have one small issue with it you cannot remove the spindle to clean it you have to use the stainless steel glass with warm , soapy water , put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it well , the problem is this while i am drinking my shake , the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom okay , okay , it 's no big deal , i suppose all in all , i like this product , and i would recommend it
i love this set this was the first real cookware i 've ever bought my husband and i did months of research before purchasing this set we 've had it now for about 2 months and i ca n't express how much we 've enjoyed it i 've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on , but i think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick , it is it 's not ! think of it like this it cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick \( maybe even better ! \) we almost went with the all clad , but we just could n't get over how uncomfortable the handles were since i have n't cooked with all clad , i ca n't compare the calphalon one to it , but i will say they heat evenly and cook evenly clean up is super easy ! just this morning i made bacon and french toast i looked at the pans and thought there is no way i 'll ever get this clean ! i poured some bar keeper 's friend on it and went to work with my scotch brite pad and within minutes it was spotless ! fantastic
my fiance and i registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us i have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware this is exactly what the dr ordered ! here 's why
this is a great roasting pan and is heavy and solid in the way all all clad pans are but it is huge if you frequently roast 20 lb turkeys or half an ox , this pan is for you a regular roasting chicken looks pretty small and forlorn it is a terrifically well made roaster , but i find i also need one just a bit smaller
the pot rack came as advertised and it was a snap to put up it looks ok and works well with my wall space i would purchase this item again
if you have problems with gripping those round coffee grinders , this one is for you ! it 's oval shape makes holding it much easier than a round grinder it grinds well and quickly and is a breeze to clean with just a few flicks of a pastry brush \( dedicate one specially for this as it will discolor over time \) it 's the shape that makes it great
this is a great thermometer , easy to use and very accurate it is an essential tool in the kitchen for making perfect candy recipes each time you should always test your thermometer in boiling water by reaching 212f or 100c before you use it i like the clip that allows you to attach it to the side of the pot it 's easy to read and dishwasher proof it 's the best !
my dish for the holidays is always mini cheesecakes it was always frustrating to get them out of my mini muffin pan this pan has made it so easy ! i no longer dread making this dessert just a note though the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly i just double my recipe and get bigger mini cheesecakes i do n't think anyone will mind
this is undeniably the best balanced , best constructed , easiest to use knife on the market i dont use any of my other knives after i bought this amazing
this is a great skillet for a party or a large family we used it on super bowl sunday for bbq wings the skillet kept them warm and looked good as a buffet server , as well it cleaned up quickly and easily
i 've been using one of these little gems for over 20 years and it still works flawlessly great output grind adjustment the only other pepper mill that i could recommend \( in addition to this one \) is the unicorn magnum plus pepper mill \( 9 in \) the perfex is the pepper mill that every well equipped kitchen should have
i have seen this set at my friends place its
i never really noticed the inner groove as a problem until i read the other reviews this was part of my first all clad set so nice ! yes , things stick in the groove , but i just use a silicone spatula while cooking and i do n't seem to have a problem i love the capacity and size shape of this unit scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot , as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting but sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if i'm not diligent about stirring out the groove the width depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work
i had never tried yogurt cheese before , but i was intrigued by the idea making the yogurt cheese was simple with this device just fill with yogurt and leave it in the fridge the product seems sturdy and was easy to clean we grow our own raspberries , and i have been eating them with ice cream last night i tried eating them with non fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar it was delicious and much healthier ! yogurt cheese is a good source of calcium and protein half a cup has 85 calories , 10 grams protein , 10 grams carbohydrate , and 235 mg calcium it would be great for layering with fruit in parfaits
we were looking for a toaster to toast thicker breads such as bagels the toaster does this and more there is a bagel button you press when toasting bagels and only the outside heating coils come on and toast the center of the bagel ! this is how i like them to be toasted the toaster also has a basket that holds the bread bagel in place while it is being toasted this feature is really nice when toasting soft things such as pop tarts good variance of heat controls too i have not found anything bad on this one good choice
butter can be better when served in a truly elegant country butter pot emile henry couleurs does not fail buy it , you will love it and , have something absolutely unique no kidding
i got rid of my electric can opener when i bought this one there is no need for it anymore this can opener works like a charm and very easy to use does not take up any space at all
i 've had one of these for many years and it recently went on the fritz after a lot of usage i'm getting another it ca n't be beat and the fact that it 's cordless is huge you can have a table full of folks for dinner , and walk around freely with your percolator no unplugging required and the coffee comes out delicious
i bought one of these for my daughter for christmas and i got this particular one because it had all the attributes she wanted she wanted it to be small ehough for just two people and to be able to remove the bowl for cleaning this was the only one i found with those attributes there were 1 qt size that were too little and all the bigger ones for big families after she got it she liked it so well that i bought one for myself and it works perfectly i think the size for a small family and the ease of cleaning are the real selling points for me
how do you cleave your meat \? i cleave my meat by meat cleaving it with a meat cleaver
i own many items from the le creuset stoneware collection , and i must say that they are all of superb quality this square pan is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts i have been impressed over and over again at how non stick the surface of this bakeware is everything i have put into le creuset bakeware brownies , casseroles , refried beans , etc has come clean with zero elbow grease in fact , the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help ! i highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line
this is my third rowenta iron and they have all served me well , but this is by far the best the steam is amazing you only have to made one pass on most items i know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves
we have been extremely pleased with our tri ply set \( we have the 8 pc set plus a number of extra pieces we 've picked up \) they heat evenly are durable the \( long \) handles really do stay cool and clean well
i used to have the calphalon commercial non stick and i prefer these the stainless steel pans seem to heat up faster , are easier to handle and you can put them in the dishwasher \( although calphalon prefers you handwash them \) no problems yet and i do n't forsee any a great purchase
having gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage , this is by far the best it 's classy looking on the counter , easy to clean , very lightweight , quiet and has alot of options for toasting and baking that make the food come out just as it should i ca n't imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again
this stockpot is wonderful ! ! the weight is professional , the size perfect and the handles are great for a little old lady like me ! ! ha ha ! what a fabulous buy ! ! thank you ! thank you ! thank you
i 've been using this apple peeler for about six years it still works great and makes pies a breeze even easy enough for kids to use ! much more stable than the kind you have to clamp to the table
excellent panini press , sturdy construction , easy clean up , looks nice just go out and buy one you wo n't regret it
the villaware panini grill has proved to be a very useful appliance , so much so that i leave it out on the counter it 's quite attractive , and certainly not an eyesore i use it often , for grilled sandwiches , of course , but also for grilled meats and fish i would caution users to avoid meat with bones , e g lamb chops \( you ca n't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill \) , and to be very careful about timing things get done twice as fast ! while the cleaning comb is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill , you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately much easier to do if the grill is warm \( not hot \) i have n't tried grilling vegetables , yet , but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way , or eggplant , or peppers
i'm blown away ! with 48 blades , this product really does the job quickly and quietly no more boom ! boom ! boom ! echoing off the walls which only produced a flat but still tough piece of meat i 'd gladly pay twice the cost for the deni because it works ! it 's very sturdy , very sharp and easy to clean in the dw i'm using cheaper cuts of meat sucessfully in recipes i had stored away because of toughness or price marinating is faster and more effective , cooking time can be reduced keep it away from kids protect your countertop the best kitchen gadget i ever bought ! !
the first time i used it i put a little white vinegar into the water with the eggs and timer it seemed to cut down on the plastic smell also the vinegar will seal your eggs if they crack preventing the insides from leaking out i did notice the timer has to be completely dark for the eggs to be done instead of the little light circle in the middle like is stated on the packag
as a person who could set boiling water on fire , i can truely state that this hard boiled egg timer has helped me be able to boil an egg prior to this i never knew if the egg was done and usually i either over cooked them , or worse , under cooked them now they come out perfect everytime highly recommend
you either get this product or you do n't it 's probably my favorite
this dust bin is a helping hand to the disabled that have difficulties bending and to workshop craftsman
i have used different brands of blenders and food processors from various manufacturers in the past , but beleive me or not , this blender food processor is really the one i am looking for it has a powerful motor that can easily break ice , plus the blender jar is made of really thick , unbreakable material , unlike many other glass blender jars one other feature i like about this combo is its wave action technology , which can continuously pull down the mixture in it and this system really works the food processor is large enough to chop mix fruits and vegetables , and above all it saves a lots of space in my kitchen i have read a lots of bad reviews from many people about other combos like this , but i do n't know what these people are exactly trying to do with a blender food processor
i 've owned a couple of sets of corelle dinnerware through the years and gave both sets away because i used them so long \( without breaking any pieces \) that i grew tired of the pattern this time i decided i wanted a plain white dinnerwear set for everyday use when i did an internet search , this corelle set came up i bought it , and i'm very pleased with my purchase i highly recommend it
i love our new white corelle it is so light and takes up much less room in the cabinet
let 's face it , you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated nice furniture and practical book shelves but you do not live alone there is probably a canine or feline lurking around it may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of garfield on it or some cutesy saying but in the long run this durable , multi use , dishwasher safe , bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he she wants a few laps of water
this is an extremely nice cutting board , great size and easy to handle cleans up in a breeze no stains and does not dull those favorite knives i have the larger size but this one is my favorite
i purchased this press to supplement a larger 8 cup model the press allows just under one standard size mug to be filled if you also are looking for a mug 's worth of coffee , i would recommend purchasing the 4 cup model as that would leave just a bit more room , and keep more of the small grindings in the press , rather than in the bottom of my cup
for ideal coffee using a french press is the best method it takes a bit more time and effort , but results in much better tasting coffee this is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact this adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise
i 've used this knife for nearly two years and i love it ! it fits perfectly in my hand and takes a razor sharp edge with little effort this knife sold me on the entire four star line
we love this thing the steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board we have a small house and not alot of wiggle room , so space saving is key for us also , i hate ironing sleeves , collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear with the steamer i just drag the wand and go , so far easy as pie on some types of fabrics or clothing details i can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial , but overall we love this thing
all coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so do n't let the comments about stray grinds deter you
everything about this set is well done the packaging and the size of the plates
i'm glad i bought this griddle ! i 've been stuck with teflon coated nonstick pans for a while , and when i saw such great deals on cast iron pans , i had to buy a few i ordered the griddle , the 10 logic grill pan , and the 10 skillet thankfully all three qualified for free super saver shipping , because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves ! the order was placed late monday night , and i was promised that my pans would ship by the following monday by wednesday the griddle had arrived , and the grill pan showed up on friday way to go , ups ! it turns out that its good to get these things early , because it takes a few days to get the natural finish pans properly seasoned i think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly food wo n't stick to a cast iron pan if you 've taken the time to season it until it 's black and almost totally non stick it takes some time and paitence , but it 's the same way with a good wok you get out of it what you put into it , and this certainly reflects in one 's cooking iif you 're going to buy one of these pans , do your homework ! ask google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan if you want to save some time , just buy the logic line of pans , because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase \( the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original \) keep in mind that you will eventually have to re season the pan , but hopefully not for a while \( we 'll see how the grill pan turns out \)
pfaltzgraff products are always reliably good , the pistoulet dinnerware actually makes me feel cheerful when i use it the colors are great and the designs are whimsical i bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun i want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too the only thing i did n't like was taking stickers off each piece in the box that always makes me crazy , it should be against the law to put stickers on dishes
i'm a student at a massage therapy school and i only have two sheet sets , so i wash these at least twice a week and they are n't showing any wear at all \( i 've had them for about 2 months \) i do n't really care for the color , but i get complements on my sheets often the order arrived a week earlier than i had expected
the angled slots are useful and easier than top loaders the right pull pushes the bread up once toasted , i love this feature the bagel toaster is handy as is the stop button all of the buttons and pulls are easy and intuitively obvious , you do n't need a degree to operate it it looks interesting on my counter since it does n't look like the typical toaster i would have given 5 stars except for the fact that a large slice of bread does n't fit all the way in , the slots could have been a bit larger they are wide enough for fat bread i really like this toaster so far
hands down the best non stick tongs i 've ever purchased definitely worth the money !
these pans are a great value they are heavy duty and will last for a long time i do alot of baking and need to freguently replace them they heat evenly to prevent burning the extra large size cuts my time in half so i can spend more time enjoying the end results with my family the silverstone coating makes clean up a breeze they are alittle heavy so they are not the best if you want those little hands to help in the baking these pans are a must have for all
kitchens etc put price stickers on the outsides of each bowl these are not coming off easily at all each one of them has a sticky , white adhesive mess on the side the bowls themselves are cute
this machine turns coffee into a near religeous experience ! every cup has a perfect crema head , is absolutely fresh , piping hot , rich and strong and it 's so fast !
the senseo delivers a good , hot cup of coffee in either single or double mode it 's easy to fill , easy to use , easy to clean , and accepts any suitably shaped coffee pod the only mild annoyance is the rattly cup tray during the brew pump operation
this cooker makes the best jasmine rice if you measure 1 1 2 cups raw , jasmine rice into the cooker , wash it under cold water for 3 washings , and then fill the cooker with water up just under the 2 cup mark \( more like 1 1 2 cups water \) with the washed rice still in the cooker just push the button and taste great , fluffy rice everytime in only 20 minutes or less !
i learned a long time ago , if you go kitchenaid , you go for life they make the highest quality , longest life products i have ever seen this hand mixer is the third of its kind i 've owned i 've had two of the braun models and they died out after about a year of average use i finally got the kitchenaid and it has been going strong for a few years now i really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot , a full 8 even though it is of substantial weight , it fits your hand like a glove i found it far superior to the braun , as a matter of fact , it does n't even compare
cooks evenly as all get out , cleans up fine in the dishwasher , and the non stick coating seems to work just fine , but the thing weighs more than my grandpa 's old blue buick !
i'm a true longaberger fan , but since they 're getting out of control on their prices lately , i thought i 'd try something else this piece by far is the only piece of pottery that i 've found that can stand up to longaberger 's quality this dish cleans beautifully and holds a nice sized lasagna i'm very , very happy with it and only wish i 'd found the le creuset brand before now grab this dish it will quickly become your favorite ! i love the color
i hate taking out the vacuum and trying to find a plug for it this means i wait until i absolutely have to use the vacuum and the house is a mess this thing is so light and convenient that i pull it out whenever there is a mess and i do n't hate doing it i have had it for about 3 months now and the battery is great in fact i keep forgetting to plug it back in and it still is always ready for me it works great on my wood floor and area rugs
i got a set of four of these same steak knives for christmas 2004 , and they 've been excellent they 've seen constant use and are still razor sharp
these knives came in a beautiful box , and are the perfect steak knife
i have several pieces of all clad i love this little bowl ! it 's great for mixing brownie 's , eggs , pancakes etc i have other bowls , but , this is the one i reach for you 're buying with confidence when you purchase all clad the name speaks for itself , quality ! you will not be disappointed
very lightweight can use it on a magazine even clipping it to the bottom of the magazine works well plenty of light to read by too i sometimes do n't need my reading glasses when using it
the pitcher does what it 's supposed to do and is easy to clean my only wish is that they would make a pitcher like this microwavable and with lines showing the ounces of the contents that way you could pour the amount you need and pre warm the milk in the pitcher prior to frothing , achieving better faster more convenient results
i just received this set the other day , and am absolutely thrilled it is top notch quality , and the pieces are very heavy my silverware drawer looks so pretty and perfect , i am tickled every time i open it ! it is definitely the last set i 'll ever need and at this price , \( and free shipping to boot \) there is no better deal anywhere
this is my favorite salad spinner , and i 've tried several over the last couple years it dries my lettuce very well , and has some useful features that i have n't seen in other spinners
i bought the hot diggity dogger many years ago we are still using it ! ! my kids have made their own hot dogs for years my middle one loves it he is getting his own place now and i am going to get him one for christmas he has used it the most he loves it it is the only appliance that i have ever gotten that has truly paid for itself
i picked this up on a special promotion for 20 , and for that price it is unbeatable has held up for years of regular use dishwasher cleaning be sure to get some soft spatulas with your first non stick pan purchase
well , um my dad has my first calphalon pan he stole it from me ha , ha he loves it to cook my mom breakfast
we are replacing all our coated pans this is a great pa
if you like to bake this is a nice product to have in your arsenal of tools i bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be extremely useful
i 've made everything from braised short ribs to homemade mole in this and i can truly say it is fabulous goes from stovetop to oven perfectly and retains heat better than any cookware i 've used cannot reccomend it highly enough
worked very well when whipping up a roux the heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and did n't scorch the rounded sides meant that i had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan cleaned up easily and looks really nice whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right it is very aesthetically pleasing
i bought a dozen of these from another retailer \( at half price \) and i love them ! they are perfect for everything that requires a small size container i use the cups to beat two eggs , melt butter , heat up baby food \( never heat food in any plastic \) , to serve ketchup or other condiments , store a small amount of leftovers , etc by using the appropriately sized cup , i save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher i recommend these highly
and i do n't even make custard ! lol i just love these for small servings of ice cream , fruit , side dishes , etc they are great with meals for anything that you do n't want to mix with the other foods on your plate they are perfect for snacks and desserts they are great for things such as pickles , olives , chopped onions , relish , dips , etc on a casual buffet or picnic table they also work well for pre portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you the typical pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use i still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware , but i see no reason to be too 'precious' about everday dishware

these small cups come in handy for making custard , warming baby food and for individual servings of snacks , and food items , etc delivery was prompt they do n't seem to be available in the department stores or discount stores anymore so was delighted to find them on line lynn martin in va
lots of reviews already , so let 's not waste your time
this little grill is not so little , with a large grill surface , but it takes up so little space on my apartment 's patio so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony it is easy to use , easy to clean , and grills perfectly no mess , no fuss
i'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching my persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched i think next time i 'll order them as individual place settings as they were n't packed well amazon will give me a 20 discount for keeping them
i like this place setting color , but i have taken the advice of others and i use coffee filters between pieces for storage it is a great place setting
i 've been using mine almost daily for cooking and or laundry , and it is still running off the original battery after more than 6 months the one small criticism that i have is that the buttons are too easily pushed , and i ca n't stick it in my pocket without stopping it or changing the setting somehow other than that , it 's all good
i bought this timer , because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had , with the big display and the simple , three button operation this particular timer was better priced than most i looked at , and i liked the extra large display i have been very happy with it the buttons do n't stick like other timers i have used i like the way the memory feature works , and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice
had this on my amazon wish list , but then came across it for the same price at a target store and bought it \( sorry amazon \) and i really am pleased so far my toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room we did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable i really like that this one has washable filters lots of savings there since getting this , my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons we 've even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons , or perhaps we were possibly over medicating him before , or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle either way , fewer snotty noses makes me happy in regard to the concerns over noise , this one is fairly quiet i keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable my son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room the oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy i would definitely recommend the honeywell hfd 120
i bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price i expected it to get me through that winter only i have used this thing just about daily for the past three years , heat in fall winter and fan in summer it still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter the only problem i am beginning to notice now is that the on off heat control wheel is starting to become loose otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated the thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on off more or less appropriately i 'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough i just bought two more , my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails a good , solid product for a very good price
best 20 i 've ever spent it does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews , the knobs are hard to read but i 've found that i use it so much that i really do n't need to be able to see it anymore the thermometer seems stable , i never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter , and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well the cord is 'regular' length so it 's not tiny and i do n't need an extension cord over all on a students budget i 've definitely found a winner
i 've had another press for many years , but i could n't get to it and had cravings for some spritz cookies so i went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with the press worked beautifully \( i 've only used the small barrel so far \) i was concerned that it was battery operated , my last one was a plug in model but it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug we had no problems with the unit , it worked quite nicely i'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future i would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press
works great ! makes small amounts of delicious coffee ! very handy
we have had this dinnerware for several years it really is beautiful however , it chips quite easily \( or maybe we are just a bit rough with 4 kids ! \) and so i find i have to buy some new ones each year so i have enough unchipped plates when company comes
this product works wonders ! i am big into making my own flavors , and making healthier than store bought versions this machine is great for that ! it is n't loud at all , definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer i used to have that could wake up the dead the fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing , no messy clean up whatsoever , or need for trips to the store for ice salt the only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout , you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top \( theres no slide window to add through while its mixing \) but even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min 's of churning soft ice cream definately never takes longer than 45 , usually 37 40 , and hard is about 45 48 min
this cloth cover is great and made from a very good material , but it does n't quite fit the 6 quart kitchenaid mixer it is a few inches short
great little item and we use it every week wonderful with non stick surfaces i want another one
got damaged in shipping but amazon happily replaced with a new one great cs amazon thanks
ordered on june 4 and received on june 12 \( one day earlier than anticipated \) was thrilled with the quality and even more with the fact that it comes fully assembled except for the adjustable shelves which are a snap to put in nice looking cabinet and i may order another one at a later date could n't be happier with the product and with the servic
i have used other egg cookers before , i like this one , but i am having to guess on the amount of water to get thew right soft boiled eggs mine keep coming out almost hard boiled even though i use the soft boiled marks
we have had this knife for about 5 months now , and we use it daily anything from peeling and dicing fruit , to slivering a potato
this knife has a great balance in your hand , good quality stainless steel , easy to sharpen and clean , as well as a comfy grip handle
excellent product for the value i was hesitant to purchase china via internet or mail , but the china arrived in perfect condition , and is beautiful and timeless thank you
darling tea pot beautiful colors ! serves several people just lovely
the table comes unassembled , but assembly is easy you will need a large phillips and medium sized phillips screwdrivers also the supports on the side for the top will need to be driven on using a hammer , or large chunk of scrap wood the fit on mine was too tight to be simply slid on construction is the cam type that is popular now all pieces are adequately labled , and small hardware comes nicely packaged the most convenient i have ever seen there is an error in the assembly documentation there are two pieces \( 1b and 1c , the table sides \) which are as far as i can tell are identical after hardware is installed as indicated on pabe 6 of 13 there is a difference the two sides are mirror images on the following page part 1c is shown but labled 1b this error did not cause me a problem during assembly the intent was clear to me
we 've gotten into homemade custard based ice cream and that means careful stirring to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot the design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot since the head is hinged , it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing , too
this kettle is very stylish with modern detailing the removable whistle and stay cool handle are added pluses its smooth lines make it very easy to clean , and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive
i love this tea kettle it not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those 10 aluminum throw aways since i am only an occasional tea drinker , i tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling \( i have cast iron elements electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use \) other tea kettles create rusty water , since water remains in the kettle not this one ! it boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove my handle does not get hot and , like i said , i have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot i do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit that 's the only flaw they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle
i add lots of cheese to my pizzas and it tends to get all over the pan with other pans , the cheese sticks and i have to pry the pizza off with a spatula but not this one ! ! it just slides right off with one shake my party pizzas come out crisp and heated evenly also , i have cut my pizzas on this pan and there was barely a scratch on it very heavyweight with no warping what a buy !
the heater is great if it had a timer it would be even greater however , it serves the intended purpose well the cool to the touch feature is perfect since i have a toddler i never leave it unattended but it 's nice to know that if the baby somehow gets close to it there wo n't be a diaster
they were a little stiff when first opened , but that is to be expected after just two washings with fabric softener and a couple extra dryer sheets , i fell in love with them i am now so protective of my sheets , not allowing my husband or children anywhere near them with dirty hands or food ! i am going to get an extra set just in case something happens to this set i would highly recommend buying these and i am very picky
there is no guess work with a name brand like pyrex , you know your gonna get quality
heavy duty without being too heavy for a fairly weak cook to shift about easy to clean , both inside and out one expects easy cleaning of non stick interior , but the stainless steel outside comes clean with nothing more than hot , soapy water the thick aluminum exterior bottom spreads heat evenly i am impressed by the non stick coating that seems impervious to ordinary wear , but will reserve judgment on that point for the one year anniversary of my purchase
i 've had this yogurt maker for about six months now and have been very pleased with the results i heat up the milk in my microwave \( recording the times in my owner 's manual so i always know just what to do \) and my total hands on time is only about five minutes from start to finish
its amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry the ability to make the suction head vertical is quite helpful the vaccum cleaner is a bit on the heavy side though if it had been a little lighter , i would have given it 5 stars
i love this pan and size
cuisinart dco 24 die cast is the best can opener i 've owned mine for a year , and love it ! if i could give it 10 stars i would
i was expecting some of the dinnerware to be broken in transit and was shocked when i opened it up everything was intact , nothing broken to include the 4 drinking glasses this dinnerware is excellent ! the pattern is simple and is extremely easy to clean i think everyone should have this set in their kitchen
i figured what the heck on this comforter similar products at major brick mortar retailers cost upwards of 100 my wife and i have been using it for several months now and are both extremely happy with the quality it is soft enough to sleep under without a flat sheet or to drape over ourselves while watching a movie on the couch excellent purchase
i had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it it was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer i love the cuisinaret ice 50bc it makes great ice cream the only negative is the noise and that 's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 it is extremely noisy so i pretty much have to leave the room when it 's on i do recommend the ben and jerry 's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one see my review on it
after my pregnancy , i was diagnosed with severe cat and dust allergies i had two cats at the time and dust \? well , alot of that i cannot believe how well this vacuum works i no longer have hives and have n't had any allergic reactions since purchasing this worth every penny
i have always missed my old toastter of yesteryear this is as close as it gets with some good updates i lever that pushes up the toast so you do n't have to dig in fantastic toast
if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever
this is by far the nicest omelet pan ever super easy cleanup too ! i love the way it stands up to high heat and still comes clean
what i like quantity of beans you can grind before dumping the container , ease of operation
i have a set of 16 year old farberware i ordered this 3 qt pan as a replacement the handle on my old 3 qt cracked from where the screw hole is after i received this beautiful pan , i noticed the limited lifetime guarantee , called the number , and a new handle for my old pan is in the mail to me as we speak this 3 qt pan is even nicer than the pans i bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid rolled edges and nicer bottom and it really is beautiful very classic styling since i use them so often and new one 's so lovely , i will definitely keep the new one even though a replacement handle is on its way
we are very happy with the knives we 've purchased they are really sharp and do well in the dishwasher
i have been extremely happy with this set of knives , and for only 40 i believe them to be an excellent value the blades are sharp and well constructed , and the handles are comfortable and seem durable the set only comes with two long knives , so you may find yourself washing them while cooking , but we like to use the steak knives for chopping smaller vegetables or trimming meat and have thus rarely found that we are short on knives while cooking if you 're looking to do professional work , these knives probably wo n't fit your needs , but for an average cook , we use them a lot and have n't found anything they ca n't handle plus , you are getting the set for about 3 per knife , and these knives would run at least 10 to 15 each if purchased individually or at a local retailer
rack stores easily , sets up quickly and provides drying space for double batch of noodles , spag , etc
this is the second microplane grater that i have purchased \( actually i purchased the extra coarse version \) , but the only 1 of the 2 that i would give a 5 rating to the other grater was from the standard line not the professional line with many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two , but in this case it definitely matters !
i make homemade stocks a lot , so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful this one works well , and thanks to its design , it cleans up easily in the dishwasher i have another one with a very thin spout and i have to wash it by hand if i let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets ca n't seem to get into its narrow opening it 's a real pain i do not have that problem with this design
my sister , my best friend and i bought these chairs for a 5 day outdoors concert series these chairs were amazing they managed to last through rain , mud , 80 per hour winds , and even a tornado ! \( they still look great \) these chairs were so comfortable and so easy to adjust because of the beans , i would recommend them to everyone and at their price , it 's a huge deal !
this iron is a technological marvel i have just had it for a few days and i have ironed some very difficult , over 100 year , heirloom open embroidered linen it was a breeze and the results were truly professional the controlls are easy to use , the steam settings excellent it just glides over those diffucult spots it may be a little pricey , but it is worth every penny
this product is extremely quiet my cat loves it and its great because it encourages her to drink more
very pleased to get this item i need it for my king size watrbed mattress , which has california king dimensions unable to find this size locally this one fitted really well , had enough depth to stretch around the waterbed mattress quality seems good
i was a little dubious about this item some of the reviews indicated that it did not really have deep pockets well , i can tell you that it does my mattress is a pillow top measuring in at 16 inches and this mattress pad accomodates it perfectly so , do not believe the nay sayers for the price this is a bargain which should not be passed up
this is in my opinion the best waffle iron you can purchase for home use there might be a better 600 waffle iron out there , but this is far and away and excellent product although i do feel that it 's a little flimsy to be called a professional product , and seeing as how i 've worked in the food industry my whole life , i feel validated in saying that however , i have used it for a while now , and i have thoroughly enjoyed it from soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time , any easy to use and clean my ony complaint is that it 's rather large for the size of my kitchen excellent waffles ! thick and golden , like in the user submitted photos i 've never had waffles so good , not even in a restaurant the true belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know how , but they 're worth the effort i read some complaints about the timing mechanism , but i find it to be spot on for the most part its worth the money
ok the only thing domestic about me is that i live in a house cooking is a necessary evil this waffle maker is the best ! we love staying at hotels w breakfast bars just so we can use the waffle makers ! two things i have noticed about this appliance i have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles , so when we use it i am making a lot of waffles if it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp , dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on we start out with a 4 setting i am in the habit of spritzing the grids every time we bake a waffle if you miss between , the waffles do n't stick , but it is apparent they do n't slip right out as easy i have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a restaurant taste we use the box batters there is no way in hell i would take the time to make the book mix lol i 've used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes \( 1 99 box \) and they all bake up great
i love the design , and it makes great cake everything is evenly browned thanks nordicware
the black plastic looks a little odd it 's not glossy like the picture it does n't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way i can discribe it i bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a pop tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the fire department had to respond this one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it good idea but , the instructions still say not to cook pop tarts unattended anyway now they tell us there is a toaster with a pop tart logo , the toastmaster 2035 if you want a laugh , read the review for that one bottom line , for the money , this toaster works great i like the lift feature a lot but , i 'd buy the white next time
yes , it 's rather uncomely it 's outer casing is obviously plastic and , ours at least , does n't have that same sheen as the example it does look cheap that being said , it 's a very functional toaster we 've had no problems in six months with variability we know what we 're going to get when we drop the lever the plastic exterior does stay cool so cool , in fact , that i promise you , you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top yep , this is a great toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and does n't mind that it 's an ugly duckling an excellent value for the money
if you have a large dishwasher these are wonderful dishes , they are not only beautiful , but sturdy , and i was so impressed to see that they had a one year break and chip warrenty with them anyway they are wonderful and we love them
this is a great food slicer for the home kitchen , \( dont compare apples with oranges , this isnt a commercial slicer , but it wasnt advertised as one either \) it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos it has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1 2 , easy to clean and very well built if you want a good slicer for home use you 'll be happy with a waring food slicer
i totally love these pans next go round i would definately order more of the same , , as i am hard on frying pans , and love these immensel
i had bought the larger set in blue and ordered these pans in blue as well thinking that they would match the pieces i already owned , i was quite disappointed when i received black instead of the blue i ordered i returned them and amazon replaced them with another set of black pans i decided to keep them but am quite upset , with my only alternative being to return them for credit
i bought one of these muffin pans because i was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining was n't destroyed by the 3rd time i wanted to use it for that alone , i would give this item 5 stars
i purchased this item in aug i cleaned the entire house and it worked wonderful it was easy to put together and very easy to clean up when finished i give this item a 5 star
not much you would need a food processor for after you buy this \( ok , it ca n't blend ingredients
i bought the omega 8002 juicer on the recommendation of dr joseph mercola , a holistic health md who has a popular newsletter and website we met him at a health fair , tried vegetable juices \( including wheatgrass juice \) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet i mean , how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day \? not so much
perhaps like you , i love silicone you can do anything with silicone you can fry , poach , make soups , and there is never a worry about heat le crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils , but their wood is unfinished , so unless you keep them oiled , they will age and spilter these you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated , and are water resistant
love the functionality being able to separate for different uses esp meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan but mine came off color \( sorta transparent \) at the corners \( and this was n't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets \) but still good value not worth exchanging so i kept them i guess mine look unique
i 've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far , not only the handiest thing i 've bought for my kitchen , but friends keep talking me into giving them one i only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years
looks good works even better nice storage case for attachment
i 've had this processor for about three months on the first day , i decided to make bread , and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine when i called customer service to help me figure out what i did wrong , they told me that occasionally , this processor 's dough blade fuses to the machine i could n't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together fortunately , the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately i received my second new processor , and tried to make cookies this time , everything worked fine , and the machine is quiet i can even talk on the phone when using this food processor i'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly
nay more than just a jar catcher , use it to scramble egges with cheese etc
the solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use we did n't want high maint type of cookware just a high quality , easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day boy we are impressed ! these cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid they are easy to clean and a dream to handle
this monstrous beast is the largest piece of cookware that we own once i manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove , it 's many uses range from cooking chickens , small turkeys , and roasts to making potato leek soup the beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly the downside is that it can take a while to heat up , especially since it should heat up on a med low setting so as not to burn items and or damage the porcelain learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med hi in order to get it boiling more quickly \( doh ! \) now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware , we are enjoying it much more ! another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine \( did i mention this thing is very very heavy \? \) now that we have tried the largest , we have begun collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them
so cliche but i am forced to learn this lesson over over i thought to myself 100 for a rice cooker , and bought a 20 one in chinatown it gave me nothing but trouble soggy rice , sometimes burned at the bottom , et cetera
this is the best hot air corn popper i 've ever had i can count on one hand the unpopped kernels in a batch highly recommended
i have never had a popcorn maker before and i love it ! i did n't think that it would be any different but its great ! it so much healthier since there is no oil used it is fast and not messy at all its cheaper in the long run to becasue a small amount goes a long way you can buy a large jar of popcorn for about 5 and its makes alot !
it works great , it 's healthier than microwave popcorn , and in the long run it 's cheaper too pour in half a cup of kernels , plug it in , and within a couple minutes you 've got a bowl full of fresh popcorn with only a few unpopped kernels and virtually no cleanup it 's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it 's far less likely to burn the popcorn only one minor complaint butter does n't really melt completely in the cup on top \( make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it \) an on off switch might 've been nice but that 's not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently oh and this product is identical to the presto poplite \( asin b00006iuwa \) just with a different label \( it even says so in the description above \) , but you get a coupon for 50 cents off orville 's with this one
there are all kinds of similar products that claim to be heat resistant to this or that temp all i can say is these spatulas are the real deal when it comes to heat resistance and at a great price i only wish there were a 3rd somewhat smaller blade however , you ca n't go wrong with these first two sizes
i was originally looking for silk sheets but not the silk sheet price tag i'm so glad i bought these sheets instead they are comfy , warm and very smooth to the touch they fit my 14 mattress with ease i 've had them about 2 months now and there are only a few drawbacks that i 've noticed they take forever to dry in my dryer and they might need ironing once dry'ish overall , not worth 600 but if you can catch them on sale you 'll be very pleased with the results
my husband has allergies to cat dander , and we have 4 indoor cats we finally broke down and paid 500 for this vacuum and replaced our old bag vacuum i must say , this thing is amazing ! i cannot say enough good things about this vacuum the first time we used it in our living room , we emptied the canister 3 times ! and i had just vacuumed with my old vacuum the day before it is amazing what this machine picks up that other vacuums leave behind i could find no flaws with this product , other than it would be nice if it were cheaper
although i love the patterns and heft of my 2 collections of stoneware , i got very tired of having them chipped and broken by the less careful members of my family although i 've had two sets of corelle before , and never had any problems with it , i never saw patterns that i could live with for very long i 've gone back to corelle , and i think this is it for me true , the plates are very light , but they are so damage resistant and i can use this pattern for any season
you could almost use these incredibly practical and beautiful dishes in place of fine china however , if you look too closely at the ivy print , you 'll notice that the ink dots are rather large more like a coarse newspaper photo print than the printed pictures in most magazines if only they had printed these with higher quality
i 've had this knife for years , use it for everything and could n't be happier i thought it would dull easily or wear down , after all it 's only 10 , but i was wrong simply fantastic for cutting bread , but also useful for vegetables and other tasks the only thing it does n't cut well is meat
i love this breadmaker ! it is so easy to use and makes delicious loaves of bread it doesn't take up a lot of space in the kitchen and all of my roommates love using it too super awesome
i purchased this for my mom her main criteria being a large size kettle she reports that she loves it and that it heats up very quickly
these cup are enormous ! \( not to mention beautiful , in that fun and elegant way that only fiestaware can be \) i was looking for a very large , oversized mug because i drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly i definately got my wish i have eaten soup and cereal out of these , i even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently very cute ! i plan on getting them in all of the six colors i have in fiestaware let me tell you again , this cup is huge
i received a blue set for christmas and i love them the stay cool handles really stay cool , even if you are cooking something for a long time they are beautiful and iloev the way they feel my caphalon pans are now collecting dust in the back of the cupboard becuase i like these so much more
the farberware millennium soft touch stainless steel 12 inch nonstick skillet is great for almost any cooking
i am so in love with my new machine many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality i received my machine really quickly and that 's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification speaking of gratification , i could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine all the reviews are true it 's perfect , once you read the instructions or perhaps do as i did , get a walk thru from the wonderful folks at delonghi customer support , you will be up and running in no time you can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care \( read the instructions \) will last a very long time the espressos i 've made so far are supreme , even my 14 year old loved a weak one i made for him and it 's so easy after set up to use it could not be any simpler who would not love this machine \? there was one website that was charging 1200 for the same machine i could not believe my eyes the only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine i really could not see what he was talking about it has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam \( it makes very creamy foam \) it will increase the volume 2 3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk but there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother they had me worried when i read that but the frother does its thing with total ease even a caveman could do it you stick it in the milk and turn the switch and , voila ! , it 's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and ca n't accomodate the foam it creates all in all , this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise this machine delivers , i love it and so will you
great item ! i have looked for something like this to use in non stick cookware so as not to scratch it is finally here ! ! i have used it several times it is a great product i even bought one for my sister too ! i love it and i am sure you will too
this tabletop fan is a telling reason why vornado has been around for a long time great air output , high quality , well built , very quiet on low speed , adjustable so you can tilt it at any angle you want , and just small enough to fit on your desk , table , or in our case , the bathroom counter my wife uses this fan to cool off in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning , and it really does the job it has a very focused air flow so she can aim it on herself without bothering me it 's very smooth running , so there 's no danger of it vibrating off the counter it costs a bit more than the typical portable fan , but then there 's nothing more frustrating than having a fan that wo n't cool you off no worries with this one ! the extra money is well spent here this fan lives up to the saying , you get what you pay for
we originally bought the product for our toddler 's room and then ended up buying a second vornado for our master bedroom this is an excellent buy for several reasons first , it is sleek and stylish , especially given its neutral color second , it provides a great wind speed given its small size third , it provides a constant soothing wind sound , which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises lastly , i have not seen the product in a retail store any cheaper than on amazon com we have had the product over 8 months with nightly use with no sign of defficiency in performance
reliable and functions much less expensive than ionic breeze or other yuppie products one might get at the s i has three fan settings and is very quiet does n't stir up dust and blow it around like a traditional fan does only draw back is that it does not have a filter
this is such a great deal here on amazon i paid more than this at an outlet ! but , that said , this is a gorgeous butter dish and a beautiful addition to your holiday table i use mine throughout the holidays and winter , it is just so very pretty and does a great job on keeping butter fresh plus , it 's very easy to clean \( do n't you love scraping those butter pieces off \? \) by just popping it on the top shelf of a dishwasher mine has been used for 12 years and still looks new
this is a very comfortable bowl to use made of sturdy plastic , it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls , which makes it convenient and easy to use the handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip \( really good when pouring batter into a pan , for instance \) , and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions the rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it no sliding i use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it oh , by the way it 's dishwasher safe , too i 've washed mine over and over and it still looks new
i did n't think it would be that large either but i got used to them after a while you need a tall container to hold them in though they are of good quality finally no melting ! great to use with my ionized cookware which makes a smooth cooking combination
i ordered this the early part of december , so had it in time for the christmas season i am so very pleasantly surprised about the power and efficiency of this one it is small so storage is a breeze , and the capacity of the bowl is just right for any chopping , etc that you need to do this is my new favorite appliance
this food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen for salsas , the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky for sauces , the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients my favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears the large bowl not only holds alot , but is also very easy to clean i highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook
these are extremely well designed and will be the hit of your party ! i have used these twice at small gatherings and each person who had a martini commented about how great they were and asked where i bought them they are easy to clean and easy to store i highly recommend them
i was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes i took a chance after reviewing others' good reviews on it and it was a good buy i used it to bake and it 's totally non stick it 's also very easy to clean after use if it can be used 5000 times as it claims , i definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper
i have the tangerine one and i love it it 's great for using in the microwave to make rice a roni and stuff like that however , my father ordered the periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered for months we finally cancelled the order and i got something else from my wish list
this product offers a phenomenon deal a steal for the asking price
these are thin , lightweight , flexible mats that are great for chopping things on and then picking up and folding up the edges to pour the food into a pot pan this thinness flexibility has a downside too i do agree with the other reviewers that these mats tend to curl up and not lay flat however , they clean up easily , the price is right , and i am happy with my purchase
i 've used these for months to protect tile countertops and they basically work except they start bending after a while on the edges and something light \( like an empty glass \) tends to fall over they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems
so glad i bought this turner ! it 's very flexible and i can get under and flip my omelette pancake beautifully i love how i can now scrape the pan clean \( as hard as i want \) without leaving any scratches it 's very easy to clean too
this peeler is amazing , and really inexpensive i am really please with how easily it takes the skin off of cucumbers , carrots , etc this is definetly a great item
after suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders , i decided to take the plunge and get the capresso infinity in brushed chrome this grinder addresses all the problems i had with the lesser machines it 's fairly quiet , free of static , grinds evenly , and is easy to clean \( although unless you use really oily beans , you should n't need to clean it very often \)
i was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over well , they were all right excellent item i bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life delicious ! as others have suggested , i never remove the stone from the oven , and lately i just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done i am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it i am extremely happy so far and i 'd highly recommend this item buon appetito
i ca n't believe how fast i received my pizza stone and the way it was packaged was great i 've use pizza stones before and loved the way they even out the heat in the oven and the cripy crust that it gives i 'll very happy with my purchase
and i like my cupcakes with frosting still on them
these are excellent ! instead of reaching for a paper towel , i grab one of these \( choosing a size that completely covers the top of the item i am microwaving \) , and then wash it when finished i did notice that the smooth side should be on top to prevent it from curling up when it gets hot i really like the fact that you can see through it since i could n't see through paper towels
this is what i use when making a roux and when i need to break up ground meat while cooking it 's nice and heavy and feels good in my hand i have cheaper wooden products and they do n't hold up as well as this does you can tell the difference between oxo wooden utensils and others because of the quality i think you can put it in the dishwasher but i never do i hand wash it and oil it whenever i oil my cutting board i love its rich color it 's a great product
i wanted to say that this is the best cleaner out there as far as im concerned
my wife and i have long been fans of fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years somehow it was n't until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size at 9 the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions especially lunch ! \( smile \)
i think this cover is just perfect for the price and easy zipper closure ! the other reviewers must not have read the description closely because it does say cover ! a featherbed is a featherbed , this says featherbed cover ! easy to take off , easy to wash , and easy to put back on
i got these as part of our wedding registry here on amazon and with about 2 months of use i am very happy with this set more so than any other set of pots pans that i own
i just got it today and ca n't wait to cook something in it it is very good looking , larger than i expected and very deep i will be cooking everything in it from now on
to prevent scratches and chipping and to retain fiesta 's smooth glossy surface , hand wash separately , one piece at a time , in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates \( cups between coffee filters \) i do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new a friend gave me all her brown dripware \( gourmet \) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched , pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing mine from the same era are still glossy , mostly scratch free , and certainly not pitted also , i do n't put my original pieces in my microwave , \( only hers \) because although it may be safe to do so , this can dull a glossy finish re fiestaware , i remember seeing relatives and neighbors fiesta cups plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and cheap looking , perhaps because of the dull rose , gray , and avacado colors at the time however , i find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and , so far , have bought heather , seamist , scarlett , tangerine , turquoise , and yellow cobalt , cinnebar , and plum are just too dark and dreary for me in the store , they are much darker than they look on here in a library book on fiestaware , they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color \( like the fruit \) would be bright pretty , too
this is a great set of dinnerware ! ! after 25 years , my husband and i decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white corelle with festive fiestaware how lovely to open the cabinets and see color ! ! ! we 've mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color fiestaware is not only beautiful , but durable and it can be put in the dishwasher , microwave , oven and freezer ! ! ! it may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available , but it 's adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value ! ! ! if you are at all tempted by it buy it ! ! ! ! you will love it ! put some color in your life
i have never had any problems using this pan the key is to use a recipe for french bread or baguettes , not just any bread recipe i use a bread machine dough cycle to prepare the dough , because i'm just not talented at breadmaking the french bread recipe in the machine 's owner 's manual worked fine , and so did a french bread recipe in a bread machine cookbook i think other doughs are too soft and get into the holes , as other reviewers have noted they did n't prepare the right kind of bread dough
i received this knife as a christmas present and so far , i am pleased what struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is i also own a wusthoff santoku \( which i love , too \) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the wusthoff was it is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action , which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables it is also wonderful for carving meats , with its long sharp blade the blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes , however , but is certainly functional the grip is also slightly larger than i would like , making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my wusthoff but these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife if price were not an issue and i had to choose between a wusthoff and a forschner fibrox , then i would probably choose a wusthoff but being that a wusthoff of this size would be at least 50 more , then price does come to play if money is no object , then choose the wonderful german steel of a wusthoff or look into the japanese steel of a shun but if you are like most of us and have to consider price , then i do believe you will be happy with a forschner fibrox chef 's knife
yes , the le creuset spatulas are wonderful they look great and are very , very useful throw away your old rubber ones which melt and buy one of these you will never regret it
i have a small kitchen , will always have a small kitchen , and finding a place to store my cookware was a problem i purchased the calphalon wall rack and hubby installed it installation was easy and the rack looks so nice againist my kitchen wall my pots are now safely organized and my kitchen has more storage space i wish i had enough room for a second rack
i 've used a pair of emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so so far , neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently , new impellers after five years , the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise , although they still moved water effectively replacing the impellers was an easy repair , and restored the unit to almost total silence the filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new , as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones
pretty pink and for a verry good cause very sturdy just pricey but as i said its for a good caus
this whisk is far superior to any other i have owned i cook constantly and a whisk is a necessary tool this one is sturdy , reliable , and stands up to the most viscous mixtures kitchenaid is the way to go for all of your appliance and cookware needs
this steamer fits perfectly on cuisinart 's 4 qt saucepan the lid seals in every bit of steam i used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn on the cob , but since no steam escapes here , i can make several batches non stop i also like the fact that the steamer is wide that means that the food will cook evenly \( instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked \) i 've only used the steamer five or six times but so far , there 's practically no sign of dullness or staining maybe just a little sign of dullness , but i'm more interested in function than appearance washing it immediately will keep it stain free overall , an incredible deal for 20 00
i'm new to bakery decorating and the tips work great ! you can use them with pastry bags or even just regular plastic bags \( if you cut open a corner for the tip \) it is easy to clean with the brush and it is great that it comes with it 's own box for easy storage there are enough tips for simple decorating , still testing out all the different sizes and options
from the review of this ca king and the review of the king , these comforter 's sizes are off only in design i have a ca king and the ca king actually fits my bed great overall but the problem is in the main part of the bordered pattern ends too high at the foot of the bed and the beginning of the ruffle part is also now too high up on the foot of the bed , even though the whole thing still fits overall if i pull the comforter down so that the ruffle part starts at the foot of my bed , it hangs a little low and i have about 10 inches at the head of my bed uncovered
two of the basic kitchen specialty items included in one package deal ! easy grip handles , stylish and quality design will assure that these items will be around in my array of often used gadgets for a long time to come
i really like this set the blue is very pretty and the tools are all very high quality
i have spent thousands of dollar 's , on meyers cookware everthing from kitchenaid , anolon , prestige , faberware , circulan , just to name a few though meyers does manufacture very high quality pots pans and i would recommend them to anyone it 's just sad that if you have any problem with them , under warranty , you have to go throught the chain of command , that never gets you anywhere , even if you want to speak with upper management about the rudeness of the customer service department their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products do n't get me wrong they do make good cookware , probably the best , but you as the consumer are at the mercy of their customer service and their descision or your fait on wheather your life time warranty is honored or not
excellent was a replacement iron for a different brand i dropped after over ten years service features have improved
this takes a little practice to get used to putting the opener properly on the can however , once you do , it works extremely well it turns smoothly and cans are opened cleanly , regardless of can size i especially like having no sharp edges
i ordered one of these , after seeing someone use a similar grill pan on a cooking show when i received the product , it was superior in quality very heavy and extremely attractive i could n't wait to use it i just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food , because i do n't own an outdoor grill and i do n't like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside not only did i get the marks , but i got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast , too the first night that i used it , i was having a dinner party while cooking it performed stellar on the first use i used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound , they were cooking evenly and slowly the food did n't burn , but i had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done the taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all i was so excited that i cooked whole bonely breast two days later and ca n't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend beware though , the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time so , the house will be full of smoke \( for the inexperienced cook like me \) , but the meat will not burn or dry out i also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine matter of fact , i'm eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great !
this is a great timer for the price , a little bulky though it 's nice to be able to set the timer for seconds , minutes or hours and also be able to count down or upwards i 'll use it as a reminder for appointments while i'm working in the office at home as well as in the kitchen this will also be handy for soccer practice
this is the knife you need to slice your bread i wondered why my old knife and new breadmaker did n't get along this knife solved the problem you get nice , clean , even slices of bread with this knife for me , it is the nicest thing to happen to make even , sliced bread , a reality in my kitchen

i love this coffee pot ! it makes a great pot of coffee , keeps it hot to that last cup , cleans like a champ and looks fabulous all at the same time ! ! i highly recommend this item a french press makes the best coffee and i 'll never have to worry about breaking another glass carafe
my joyce chen bowls arrived perfectly packed and in excellent shape the individual boxes themselves were sturdy and have extra cushioning inside , spoon and chopsticks were wrapped separately my son is addicted to ramen noodles and serving them in these bowls takes it up a notch i love the chopsticks that come with the set they have grooves at the tip that serve to hold slippery noodle better than anything i have ever seen these noodle bowls make a 15 cent meal look so special and i would n't hesitate to order more as gifts
the first thing i noticed about this is just how good it looks it really is a showpiece in my kitchen the smooth , rounded shape and the shiny chrome finish really make it look fabulous and i leave it out on the counter all the time apart from that , it seems pretty much a normal toaster the extra lift feature makes getting small bagels out very easy , and the electronic buttons are handy too i like the way it can take four big pieces of bread or bagels without taking up too much room in the kitchen 5 stars
i just keep buying more of these glasses , including other sizes and shapes they look good and are great at keeping drinks hot or cold
i think it 's cleaning itself says my wife as she was soaking it in the sink after we baked mac and cheese it seemed like it was i gave it a quick scrub with a songe and it was clean no need to soak it really
i have the four piece set of these silicone utensils , and have been very pleased with them they are heat resistant , heavy duty , and look sharp they are slightly flexible , but i have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner the best part is the wonderful easy clean properties of the silicone my other heat resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish these look great right out of the dishwasher ! i 've had them for a year and they 've held up great the turner has not disintegrated on the edge , either , like many other types do the smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you 're cooking
this is a nice sturdy wooden knife block with plenty of slots
i have used this filter with my grind n brew for 2 years i put it in the dishwasher at least twice and have never had any problems with it i have no idea what these other reviewers are doing wrong , but i love this filter i never have grounds in my coffee there is always a little darker thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee !
love this cake plate looks like our retro 50s kitchen its solid , well formed glass with fluting on the base , a nice touch and you ca n't beat the price our dinner guests are always excited about desert when they see it displayed so adoringly i ca n't think of a single thing bad about it well , maybe the cleaning part
i 've enjoyed mine for 15 years , my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years , not sure how old my grandma 's is , all still run great mixes breads , cookies , cakes , pancakes , hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly easy to clean some reviews have commented on the weight , my mom has had arthritis for a long time , and she still uses this all the time just leave it on your counter , it looks great and you 're going to uses it every other day anyway it is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints just feels good to have something so beautiful , reliable , well made and useful sitting handy on the counter
i have 4 of these cookie sheets , and am ordering more i bake in quantity , and these sheets are the only ones i 've found that do n't warp when heated , and that come clean without intense effort they also maintain a very consistent heat , so that all the cookies on the sheet brown at the same time
this is a really nice cookie sheet i baked cookies soon after i received this cookie sheet , and they were great ! i plan to order another so that i have 2 on hand i am tired of the nonstick pans that scratch and then rust easily this is a nice alternative
i just bought this piece and tried it out i love the size and no drip mouth the color is beautiful and its so pretty on my buffet
i have not purchased a ripe pineapple due to the fact that it is so difficult to hand peel so i have gone without this delicious fruit for too long i happened on the slicer while browsing amazon and could not believe they had such a tool ! i ordered it right then and it arrived in a few days all that was said about it is really true ! it cuts a pineapple in a matter of seconds leaving a very attractive bowel , the pinapple it self
hi ,
this coffee maker is the best i have ever used it keeps the coffee hot for 2 hours or more after brewing and it is easy to clean and maintain i would recommend this appliance to anyone
i like this product quality is very good i use it for other things besides marinating store homemade cookies in it , left over soups and stews , etc i am glad i bought it
emile henri has a superb line of table ware and these coffe mugs are no exception brilliantly hued and durable
i love products that are genuinely high quality goods this fan comes under that category
i agree with most of the positive reviews of the vacuvin food saver set however , i 'd love a larger size one that could hold at least one pound of ground coffee i suppose the downside would be that it would take longer to pump the air out of a larger container but , they 're easy to use , look nice , and keep the food fresher longer
this was my first 'nice' knife when i was taken in by the santoku craze , and it was certainly a decent choice the knife is sharp out of the box , reasonably well balanced , and has pretty good fit finish for the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless skinless chicken , etc , that are largely prepared , this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work the real drawback is the length when you live in the south , you see vidalia onions that are 7 in diameter this knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies and do n't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone in meats since i got this knife , i 've expanded my collection quite a bit , even adding some real japanese steel but this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip , where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife ca n't get me to relinquish the big blade for most cooks , who need a real omni tasker knife , i would look for a 9 10 chef 's knife rather than this
this listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes corelle has recently released this is fabulous because i was concerned that the old corelle i remember is a bit thin these carry a 5 year warranty vs the regular 3 yr
the silverware is extremely nice compared to other i bought elsewhere they are polished for a nice feel , and combined with the weight , this makes for pleasure while eating also , saving more than 50 from the original price is awesome ! !
this cooking serving stainless steel slotted spoon , like the rest of the products from the oxo good grips line , is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability , and flawless performance its ergonomic design , hefty body , and big , pressure absorbing , non slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers , are the reasons why you 'll prefer this product to the more traditional models , as they will allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress related injuries
i love the toaster oven i used it about every day strongly recommend this to buyers
if you want to pay over 100 you can find much better quality , but for 70 less this is a fantastic value
this is the bowl that we were looking for we found it at several places , but amazon com had the best price they even beat the local discount cooking stor
after 3 years , and oddly enough three different replacement robots , the battery finally lost its ability to charge being a product that has one model made by one manufacturer , i was very surprised to find the battery at a significantly lower price at amazon the product works as one would expect , it charged right up and it runs my roomba , as long as it does n't blow up like a laptop battery , i will continue to enjoy a product that makes my life a little easier now if they could come up with a robot that washes and folds laundry , now that would be a must have product
this spatula makes frosting simple to complex cakes very easy works well with many different icings
i bought this little percolator in order to brew the homemade coffee my grandma gave me it works great perfect size , easy to use and easy on the eyes for the beginners \( like me \) it does take a couple of trial runs to get the perfect cup of coffee \( a measuring spoon would have been nice \) but it 's all well worth it to get a break from starbucks
i love the quality and softness of this product the sheet set fit perfectly on my bed and the price is unbeatabl
it is n't at all like what i expected it is a very dense jersey \( knit \) and keeps shape while stretching over an 18 mattress
these glasses are superb in quality and appearance the purchaser should be aware that they are of the smaller type of martini glass , more the original size , rather than the wide mouth styles you see in some stores today
this is a wonderfully efficient zesting tool if you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product it boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting very easy to hold and twist when zesting it even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling this beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife \( as i did for years before i learned better \) i use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and i see no signs that this tool will dull , break , or wear out anytime soon highly recommended tool for any active zester as easy to wash as a fork cool
these are hefty , and not super soft but high quality no fancy stitching or detail of any kind ran a little small for my king bed , but you ca n't beat the price
this is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost made of commercial grade materials , it delivers quality nearly every time i have made many different foods on these sheets , including fish sticks , cookies , meats and roasted potatoes it works great with everyone , and there is no transfer ever browning is even and consistent , and i personally have n't yet had one warp at high temps and i have 4 of them
wish i 'd had this pan years ago it would have saved me at least a year in clean up time ! nothing sticks to the pan ! it cooks beautifully is well worth the price with a lifetime warranty , super easy clean up , and utensil safe , it is a great investment ! if i cooked more often , i would buy the larger swiss diamond also
this \( rose fiestaware \) sugar and creamer set is very beautiful true to all of the fiestaware pieces this set goes very nicely with the large fiestaware teapot a wonderful gift for anyone and durable , pretty and cheerful to use for your own family the availability was great and the speed of delivery was wonderful amazon does an outstanding job as usual of customer service ! all of the amazon staff are polite , helpful , and efficient
if you have a good cook \( or chef \) in the family , this makes a very impressive gift it 's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking
this roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment it is heavy duty and i have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey it is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast i could fit in my oven it washes clean with little effort so i have not had to use the dishwasher it looks like new after washing this pan will be around a lot longer than i will !
as advertised , and described in various reviews , the blender is solid , powerful and loud very loud i have to block my ears when it 's running but i had expected that so i'm not complaining my one complaint is that the water tight lid is not and if i fill it up too full liquid comes out the top
i am a great cook but not a good bread baker this machine is a joy , a godsend , i love it easy to use , easy to clean and it never fails buy it now you wo n't be sorry i had 2 different breadmakers before this one they shall remain nameless just buy this one i have had mine for 2 years this christmas what fun i have had with it
we had the original hamilton beach brewmaster and loved it we like this one even better , although it takes longer for the coffee to brew i do n't think i could ever go back to a regular coffee maker
i love this coffeepot i had the older version and had a problem with the timing light but so far this works great it 's very easy to set up the timer and looks great sitting on the counter i'm the only coffee drinker in the house and i love the fact you can just hold a cup underneath and get all the coffee you want without the burnt taste would highly recommend to everyone
this is my first oil sprayer so i ca n't say this is better than that or whatsoever i bought it after reading the reviews here it was working great for few days and i'm not sure how it happened but i saw a tiny hole on the plastic lid and obviously it could n't hold the pressure anymore i purchased it from target com so i'm not sure about the return policy i 'll have to find out but other than that it was grea
i own both the 1 cup and 2 cup and recommend you buy both for measuring liquids if you do n't want to buy both , just buy the 2 cup , as it 's more versatile i have other measuring cups , but these are the ones i reach for over and over very convenient no bending i love it ! ingenious ! my only criticism and it 's very minor is that the design of the handle makes it wobble slightly rather than sitting firmly on a flat surface if they correct this minor design flaw , it would get five stars
we wanted to rid our kitchen of the microwave for health reasons but still have a fast way to get hot water i never dreamed any small appliance could be this great water comes to a rolling boil far faster than the microwave was ever able to do we liked this so well we bought a second one for the lower level of our home
i love my donvier ! i got it as a gift a number of years ago and wo n't let it out of my kitchen just last night , i made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest , using some over ripe strawberries in the refrigerator but once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans , first blended in the blender the end result was scrumptuous
since i liked it so much , i decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up 10 in just one week ! however , the quality is good and i am satisfied with the item
lodge makes great products at a great price this dutch oven has been in constant use since we bought it in january potatoes , chops , stews , popcorn , whatever it does it all the nonstick surface works as advertised , the inside of the pot is easy to clean and the handle is industrial strength only complaint the lid can be hard to clean because of its little spikes on the inside check out the great sprite soda pop potato recipe they provide with the instructions
nordic ware makes the best looking pans , but this is my favorite pan from nordic ware ! this pan makes beautiful breads and cakes because it has a non stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher setting when baking and even though it is non stick , i suggest that you spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick ! it 's also very easy to clean up
we had been enjoying the whole experience of the keurig b50 , when i got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that keurig was promoting a new and improved single cup brewer i confess i coveted this new machine in a big way so when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new b70 last week on our front stoop , it was very much like christmas for me my wife just smiled , and the kids gave out a sincere , whoa , that 's cool ! at our new kitchen friend
when my sons cordless died he went an bought this phone system for himself so that he could keep one in his room and another in his office \( located in separate areas of the home \) after he let it charge overnight we tested it out and were ammazed with it it could work inside outside all the way to the mailbox with no little static ! ! ! it was is amazing we contacted vtech they offer a very similar model for people with multilines mailboxes and has the capability to add 7 hand sets which is great since we all have seperated lines and sep mailboxes
i am very pleased with this lightweight , inexpensive teakettle the size is great you can make many cups of tea in a single boil , but because the kettle is lightweight , it is still manageable with lots of water inside trigger button on handle makes pouring easy and burn free i highly recommend this product
these ramekins are perfect for flan , custard , pudding , and the like they are beautiful , yet very heavy duty after buying one set in cherry red , i bought another set in flame 2 weeks later these are a definate must buy
i just needed to refute that first review also this is not a toy , it 's not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes \( though it will work for sure \) i assume that 's what the first reviewer wanted it for you can get a 19 dollar piece to do that it 's not about a foot long ! it 's 17 inches , and needs to be it 's also not 20 lbs it 's 2 lbs and it 's weight is perfect it 's not a hand blender for mixing water it 's an immersion blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses i'm a professional chef , this is part of my kit that i do n't leave home without you should n't be home without it
i feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the misguided reviewer who likened it to a jack hammer that review gave me pause when i was considering ordering it fortunately i had faith in amazon 's return policy and decided to give it a chance it 's not at all too heavy or too large i'm 5' 3 with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly it really is ergonomically designed the power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it you have no need to change your grip until you 're through blending which is next to no time it blends thoroughly and efficiently it does have enough weight to give you some control you would n't want something this powerful to be too light it could just fly out of your grasp this feels solid , is very attractive , and also appears to be very well made i love it if you think you might want an immersion blender \( and if you cook , you do \) you 'll love it too
this is a well designed and manufactured tool the locking feature makes it convenient to store in a drawer and the black rubber handle makes the tongs comfortable to hold i do n't know how i did without this tool before another hit for the goodgrips brand
i really like these pillows , they plump back up during the day when not being used they are comfortable and hugable
my old flatware set was worn out and after 15 years i could n't expect any more out of it i searched for quite a bit to find the right setting for my family this set is quality made , dishwasher safe and all around great !
i love my keurig coffee maker but missed some of my very special coffees now i can grind and brew my favorites with this filter
i am surprised to see so many negative reviews we 've had ours for five or six years , use it at least daily , and have been quite satisified with its performance it generally toasts the bread evenly , and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next it does n't seem that slow to me , but my expectations may differ from yours i agree the 2 4 slice switch is confusing , but we just leave it on the four slice setting i also agree it is a bit pricey , but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently perhaps cuisinart has a quality control problem , but we would n't hesitate to buy another one good luck
for the money , i'm satisfied with this toaster it 's pretty much a basic toaster
just what i needed to cut veggies for my daily salads saw one similar on a popular cooking show but that one was 40 00 more ! this works just as well i'm sure and such a cool color ! it 's easy to find in a drawer or my wooden spoon jug where i keep all odd utensils it is a little light weight , but after going through carpal tunnel surgery , i do n't think i need one much heavier fast shipping and great packaging as well another great find from amazon
as far as home made ice cream goes , the finnished product turns out pretty good i would recommend using a mix \( wal mart and k mart sell many mixes at only 2 \) though , for it 's much cheaper and tastes better than home made recipies the only problem is that the ice cream is a little soft when done , otherwise this product is good
i am not sure what the folks who left negative reviews did wrong , but we got it right the very first time and boy did we ever we made it a family project on a sunday night my wife , my daughter and myself we froze the pot over night and all day and got it out sunday evening we poured in our mixture in less than 1 2 hour the alarm sounded , the light turned green , my daughter gleefuly pushed the dispense button and out came delicous vanilla softserve clean up not so bad either we love it good family project
product lived up to its listed features the person who received it as a gift was thrilled with it thank you
this was exactly as described inexpensive , dense wood cutting board on one side with a nice pastry board on the other the wood has an attractive grain that is not out of place on the counter full time
based on the other reviews posted , i purchased this board and am extremely pleased with it it 's nice and big for rolling out all kinds of doughs you may have to make room in your cabinet to store it if you do n't want it on your counter all the time , but it is worth the trouble also it washes up nicely
i love having the edge measurements as well as the circular measurments i wish i had a cabinet big enough for this wonder tool , but like some of my favorite baking sheets , this will have to live on top of the counter after use , it cleans up very nicely , and a coat of mineral oil makes it look like a million dollars i'm very satisfied
same lifespan as single brita filters , lower price only wish the indicator was n't the slowness of the filter
these knives rock i almost have every knife they make and i love them all especially the bread knife ! the blue fish knife \( how brilliant is that to color code knives \? \) is terrific and showed up just in time for making gravlox this weekend !
this is a great little machine for college students and people with apartments though i would n't recomend it for a family \( get a bigger version \) , it was perfect for me and it 's quick and easy a great buy and very much exceeded my expectations i love it
i received four of these etched glass goblets for christmas they are absolutely beautiful and now are my favorite pieces in my set of winterberry pfaltzgraff dishes they are a must to add to your collection
all i needed was an iron to get the wrinkles out of my cloths for school and this did a very good job now to be honest , this is the first iron that i 've owned so i do n't have anything to compare it will but none the less , for me , it did it 's job
we 've only used them once , so ca n't comment on longevity , but our initial use was great no odor or fumes as other people have reported even though we forgot to spray it , the muffins came out clean and easy the tray is a definite plus !
i was pretty hesitant to try a new baking item , but these muffin pans are wonderful ! the cleanup is super easy , there is no problem getting the baked item to slip out , and i do n't have to worry about rust or tarnish i would highly recommend this type of new bakeware to anyone who loves to bake , but does n't love to clean
the knives are great , dishwasher safe , cut beautifully a bargain at the price but a nicer , more permanent box would be nice
i could n't disagree more with the previous reviewer i purchased the oster milkshake maker and use it almost everyday three of my sons love their shakes super thick the oster had no problem with the amount of ice cream my other son watches his weight for wrestling , and i just put low fat milk and a little cocoa and the oster whips up an incredibly thick drink \( usually making a glass and a half \) if you put in some crushed ice with milk , it also whips up very thick and frothy i am very pleased
great product , does what it 's suppose to do brushes are the best i have three huskies and it handles the dog hair expertly without clogging up for being such a heavy , beastly unit , i cannot understand why the handle is built for such a petite hand it should be at least an inch longer so i can actually fit my hand in to it
they do what they hold themselves out to do and considering how hard its been finding these items , who can complain
the dishes came quickly and were in perfect condition the introductory offer of an amazon com credit card allowed me to get a 40 discount and i 've been using it since for the reward points great doing business with you
the name polder keeps appearing in my home ! why \? because they make a great and accurate product \( s \) polder is my kind of brand it does what it 's supposed to do and it 's not overpriced
especially for your guests but you could use them in your master bath , of course the pile embroidery design is very pretty very quality looking i bought towels hand towels after i was so pleased with the first batch they are absorbant and the color is a yummy butter creamy and , a great buy what more can you ask for
i have a few of these wash clothes sitting in my bathroom closet they 're beautiful in design and give you an excellent clean feeling after you 've used them \( with soap and water , of course \) looking forward to a shower just got a whole lot better
i 've never had trouble fitting my butter stick in the fiestaware butter dish never but the reviewer sho could n't get hers to fit did give me a chuckle
i received this cleaver as graduation present when i finished culinary school and i have been thankful ever since this is a really nice looking cleaver the handle is excellent it looks great feels just right in my hand it has a good weight to it so that i am able to cut through bones and large pieces of meat with no trouble at all and with a name like henckels you cannot go wrong
i used one of these when i was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so i could spin pizza 's until recently i never knew how versitile these things are
i 've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well they say not to put them in the dishwasher but i have and the non stick is holding up fine the lids fit nice and tight and the handles do n't get too hot unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven , in that case the handle will be hot
my husband and i bought this cookware set when we first got married i absolutely love it ! it has a nice weight to it the base walls are thick , also the lids fit perfectly it heats evenly i never have had any problems with food sticking to them just make sure you do n't use metal utensils with these or they may scratch the coating , and the only thing i do n't like about these is that the oustide can get stained if you let a pan boil over or put it on a burner that is not clean \( my husband used to put tortillas bologna on our coil burner now i have a stain on the bottom of my frying pan \) but i'm sure a little barkeeper 's will take it out all in all they 're great i highly recommend the
though these utensils are not recommended for direct use with the cuisinart pots and pans \( they will scrape the finish \) they have a terrific feel to them they are evenly balanced with a useful machanical advantage i find them especially functional as serving utensils at the table
i'm a single 47 year old guy i'm not a great cook i 've lost 25 \( am now down to 168 \) and am trying to eat better this makes it easy ! no more nuking junk food , or frying food covered in fat , just steam it no more worries about burning things \( the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done \) i bought the oster 5712 last week i 've cooked boiled eggs , frozen chicken breast , contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far it rocks ! tonight i'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and i'm 99 9 sure it will turn out great even though i 've never tried it before this baby makes cooking easy cleaning it is also easy no burnt food on it , just hot water for cleaning it 's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater just a bit of soap and spray it off as far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal ! jo
this product was exactly what i was looking for and now that i have it i am very pleased in the way it works it is a darn good steamer
took a few minutes to get the hang of using the rolling pin , after that it became a piece of cake i love the length , weight and now it is the only rolling pin that i use
i wish i would have bought one a long time ago it is so convenient easy to clean up very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking seems powerful enough for everything i have tried it on you still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so that would be the only negative otherwise i love it
we just bought a new house , and not only is our bedroom the coldest room , we also painted it a blue grey my husband did not want to part ways with our old comforter , even though it did n't match the walls this duvet cover was the perfect solution it is extremely soft and warm , and the windstream colored snowflakes match our walls perfectly i may even keep in on the bed in the summer when we have the a c going in the room
the quality of this set is very good they are useful when you eat crabs at first i thought maybe it was hard to clean them , but i was wrong they are easy to use and easy to clean sometimes i also use the clip to crash the nuts it works great
this is a very nice seafood set the oxo brand is always something you can rely on the only complaint i have about this set is that the cracker is a little bit on the heavy and clunky side
i bought these in a few colors \( at a higher price \) about a month ago they were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that i mistakenly thought would be of better quality well the designer towels shed about 1 2 their heft in my drier
have had this for several weeks almost stopped using my stove being a bachelor , somewhere i forgot how much better food tastes broiled or on the spit have done whole chickens a couple of times , really moist and tender this is easy to use , and it is a good looking unit cooking times are consistent no problems so far i have not found the fan to be noisy , perhaps that individual just has a bad unit my folks sent me some of those big elastic bands to use when you are using the spit those work well too
i agree with all of the other good reviews i received my waffle maker yesterday and made waffles this morning all came out great , from the first to the last nothing to clean up , just wipe it i'm completely satisfied
i have two of these warmers and use them for much more than butter especially around the holidays they are heavy duty , which you do n't see by the pciture , and are also great for melting chocolate , cheese , scalding milk , and much more if you need a smaller pan for cooking project , i stongly recommend this one !
pictures on line do n't come close to the beauty of the set the tea pot is large ! the set is worth every penny i paid and then some i checked other web sites and the price for this set was 150 up to 225 buy it , you ca n't find it for less i shopped around prior to making my purchase !
wow ! finally a product that does what it claims to do it filters water ! incroyable
this flatware set is beautiful enough for special occasions but practical enough for everyday family use we wash it in a dishwasher with no special treatment and it comes out shining everytime my family love the solid feel of the forks
this shampoo is not only an excellent carpet cleaner , but the additives that neutralize the pet odors from little accidents work incredibly well i highly recommend this product
i received this grinder as a christmas gift from my son in law after my cheapo , cheapo grinder went kaput ! i am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day , sometimes twice in one day , and it works really well
i had one many years ago and never had a problem good suction , maybe a little loud , but i do n't care i liked it so much i'm trying to get a new one i do n't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned smoking , etc it worked well and cleaned well
i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it i am no exception i really like it it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you ca n't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over i do n't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt the price was great \( less than 30 \) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well the best use i get out of it is the roller brush the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets
this is my third handmixer in a year , finally got something exactly what i wanted great value and powerful i highly recommended this product especially for those of u who need it for making different kind of doughs
i used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself , so i have tried many cutlery products from many different brands in 2003 , i bought these calphalon contemporary shears since i did not own a pair of shears before i purchased these , i tried a pair of henckels twinshear kitchen shears , and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as i would have liked i was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in china rather than in germany or japan , even though newer brands such as calphalon and furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in china after over a year of using these , i am quite impressed with them the handles are very comfortable , and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned henckels shears most impressively , the blades show very little wear , despite the fact i have certainly used them quite often also , the handles on these are far better compared to those on the calphalon traditional and stainless shears in conclusion , i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top quality , reasonably priced set of kitchen shears
the price of this pan threw me , but i decided to give it a try since the cookware is so good the pan is the best i 've ever used it does n't stick , it cleans up quickly , and it 's true , you can use metal utensils in it i 've had the pan for almost a year , and it looks , and bakes , as if it 's brand new , even though it is used constantly
fiestaware is timeless classic shape , classic colors , great quality the finish is lead free the looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles great gift can always be used the only drawback i would say is the colors sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have
this is a brilliant device and the daddy of pizza wheels , all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune ! one spin across the pizza and it 's done ! no repeated to and froing or worse , finishing the job with a knife ! it does not need sharpening either , just as well cos i am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job ! oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now
this all clad ladle is a beauty you 'll wonder how you ever did without before i bought this , my drawers held only gravy sauce ladles you know , those short little things that 'll fall down inside your pot and your soup buy one of these and suffer that fate no more ! now that i own this , i truly enjoy preparing big pots of stew or soup you 'll feel like a real chef when you dish up portions to your family or friends
i use calphalon commercial hard anodized and wanted to try out stainless steel this pan seemed the ideal way to do it , given the price and the manufacturing pedigree \( all clad \) the first time i used it i fried ham and scrambled eggs in it using less than 2 tbsp of butter very little stuck to it , and clean up was about as easy as a non stick pan use a dobie pad as recommended and you 'll have no problems i wo n't trade my calphalon for stainless , but having said that , it looks great , heats evenly , and cooks like a champ well worth the 20 give it a try and leave the wear ever non stick behind
the scale i received from amazon looks the same as the picture for the soehnle vera white digital food scale but it 's a different model the one i received uses the cr 2430 lithium battery , not four aas as advertised also , the product manual is different the actual manual 's title is 67000 67007 g oz , not 8122 8123 g oz on the bottom of the scale , there is a number similar to soehnle 's product numbers , 812215 but i could not find such a product anywhere
this is my first food processor and i am thrilled with my cuisinart it is a perfect size for my needs and very easy to use
this product provide a couple of interesting issues the first one you do n't need electricity to make it work on your table \( no cables on your fancy candle light dinner \) the second one it works all you need is to let it rest in your fridge , and that 's it
even though its a 10 bowl , its not deep enough for salads
the item is what i expected at this price i like the shape of the dishes and bowls my only complaint is that a dessert dish broke in shipping and it took forever for a new one to arrive and it was chipped
i have cuisinart dlc 2011 prep 11 plus food processor for about a year and i would n't even think that i could use it so much i 've got additional discs and i can do anything it 's fast , it 's reliable , it 's really helpfull i would probably ish to have a bigger size , but this one is ok and i did n't want to spend more i 've spent the difference in price on discs and discs holder
i love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor since i use it for all sorts of cooking , i have purchased all of the disks for it i do n't want three or four different holders for disks , etc because i do n't have unlimited closet and counter space since they sell a complete set of disks why , oh , why do n't they sell a tower \( small footprint \) that will hold all of the attachments this is short sighted of them i have friends who have the same gripe if someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company

i sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession he loves this knife it does n't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts ! i higly recommend it to anyone
it 's a pretty good down pillow it 's well filled and does n't feel too low to me
i really love these bed sheets from the moment i got them i put them on my king size bed and i almost did n't want to take them off to wash them they are very comfortable and of a very good quality the fitted sheet does have deep pockets indeed so they stay attached to the matress even after several days of use i am very pleased with this product
my friend orri suggested the breville 800jexl my husband , who enjoys dishes to cooking , has become the expert juicer it 's definitely worth the extra money if you are serious about juicing remember if you 're in a rush , but want juice , simply wash the breville off and save the soaping for the dishwasher the clean up is really not bad if you cook and are use to doing dishes have fun ginge
i got this to use with my rotisserie and have ended up using it everywhere i cook meat its ease of use and ease to clean makes it a favorite in my kitchen tool drawer
fabulous ! ! ! i purchased this as a gift for relatives who are very highly educated , worldy , well travelled , serious chefs , who 've enjoyed coffee brewed all over the world \( even antarctica ! \) needless to say , gift buying for them is tricky ! when they got this , their bodum decanter had just broken , so the timing was perfect they love this model ! use it daily ! in fact , they 're so impressed , that they now order it from amazon com give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle also note , there is a coordinating sugar creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly , holds adequate volumes of sugar cream , makes a stunning table display i already have a few bodum sets , including the stainless steel insulated models , so i wo n't need another fp , but i also will give this frieling model as a wedding housewarming gift to coffee aficionados
i like it 's size , weight , and the fact that it is clear glass so you can see the tea i keep it warm at my desk with the aid of a coffee cup warmer and one cup will last for several hours the strainer works flawlessly for me
i have four of these mugs
great product for a good price all sent as ordered
the previous reviewer was correct this item does not have the pump and hose for using it without a garden hose i was easily able to order these parts and the clip to hold the pump from the coleman website just look at the hot water on demand there and open the replacement parts link
i love this pitcher it sits on my counter all the time beatiful cobalt blue color , with white inside , really adds something to creamers , wish sold the big one i would buy it in a heart beat great for syrup also
we 've had this coffee pot for about 3 months and absolutely love it once you learn how everything sits correctly you can have great coffee all the time it 's great having the coffee already in the pot we get about 4 pots of coffee from what is stored the only thing i would have liked better was a 12 cup coffee pot i sometimes find after we have our coffee in the morning and with my husband taking a thermos has me sometimes having to make another pot it 's no big deal though because it 's so easy you 'll love it
i purchased this product the day before going on vacation , so i did n't have much time to research i 've owned it for 28 days , and it 's been working fine so far i use small pellets , not flakes so that 's all i can rate it for it seems to work at the same times every day , and a uniform amount of food appears to drop it is not quiet , so if it is used in a bedroom , make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping i acually do n't mind knowing when it 's running , so if i'm around i can check on it 's function time will tell if it 's a great product but so far , so good
what i especially appreciate about this mug is that , unlike cheaper stainless steel mugs , this one does not impart a metallic flavor to tea it really insulates , beverage stays hot for hours while the mug feels cool to the touch my husband and i each have one do n't leave home without it
as a long time critic of kitchen tools and all miracle whip applicators , i was skeptical when i was presented with this device it uses the same scraper spatula design that has been prevalent in the united states since the release of the tupperware model r at first glance i was not impressed with this tool it was nothing flashy , although i must admit the red color was quite innovative but , the real test would have to come when i put it into service she was n't as stiff as some of the hard plastic models i have tested , but not as floppy as most silicone models i have labored through i would have to say it was a happy medium so i dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with miracle whip , and i must say this spatula sparkled pounds of miracle whip got stuffed into this little asian number , and the spatula never failed i knock off one point for the simple fact , that they do n't offer a miracle whip branded version of this spatula now that would be really nice also , not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon , but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool
this one works great i had a square krupps waffle maker before and this one is ten times better cooks better , heats faster , looks better , and the audible ready alert is great i saw this one on good eats on food network , and i am thrilled that i have this one exactly what i wanted
until i purchased this meat grinder , i was grinding with a manual one it was a chore to set up and clean up the pro mg 800 professional meat grinder made the grinding easy it does not have to be clamped on the table ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath easy clean up , fast speed , three blades interchangeable for the grinding i am totally happy with the product i purchased also , on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing the advantage of having a grinder is i can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat
tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it \? the vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we 've tried the boston cocktail shaker does not have this problem we had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems the only drawback \( very minor \) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass so if you 're measuring out small quantities of liquor , you still need to use a jigger other than that , it is very easy to use and clean top rating for this bar helper
my dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything we can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes for stir frying it is incredible , nothing sticks to it and we do n't have to worry about even cooking i have recently purchased one for myself and i could n't be happier with it at less than 50 is is a great bargain another great use for it is deep frying it is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands overall my favorite cooking tool ever
i bought the 14 piece set for my parents and then added this pan to their collection they just love it
i bought 3 of these they are great easy to use , easy to clean and they work after buying one i ordered 2 more for gifts and both of those people who recieved them also loved them
this is a great product , and you can get it , along with any other products on amazon up to 500 free ! participate in a special promotion and get a free 500 amazon gift card at this web site ilikethis info amazo
i like these lid covers as they fit very well i have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking , or aluminum foil tearing i would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them i also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator
there is n't much you say about a plasic cover , but i 'll try these covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you 're mixing fresh you can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware \( spelling \? \) item i 'd recomend having them around , because you 'll use them ! these are for the 4 1 2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe
this thing is wonderful i 've enjoyed one since my first home and it makes a tremendous difference esp if you rent and do n't have any control over the kind of tub you have
i bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago they have actually become my favorite sheets i have several sets , and many of them were quite exepensive , but i always seem to reach for these sheets the only time we use another set is when we are washing these they are very soft stretchy \( not too stretchy \) and wash up so nice \( they hold the dryer warmth so well \) ! this set has been great during the summer i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket you could n't get a better set anywhere near this price !
my teapot arrived from amazon very quickly and i was very pleased with my first purchase it is just the right size for me as i usually make two or three cups even though it could hold more , it is not too large for a smaller amount the tea does not drip when poured thank goodness ! the one i had before consistently dripped so my reason for getting a new one this one also fits well in my hand , and i love the fact that you can microwave it if you need to heat up a bit overall , i would say it is quite lovely and and high quality
item exactly as promised was a gift for dad 's new wife she was very happy with it
even if entering the kitchen gives you hives , this spoon can make it easier it 's balanced , easy to use and easy to clean and store it goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion without spilling , breaking like some of the el cheapo brands if you care for this spoon it will serve you well for many years my first one i used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with \( in \? \) the blender been searching for one ever since to replace and at this price i am buying several
this is a great product , not only does it boil water fast , it is easy to fill and use , and pours beautifully
very nice , beats flimsy plastic i have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets these will probably outlast me
i bought this for chinese japanese style hotpot it turned out to be a fabulous hotpot \( fast boiling time \) and an excellent grill ! although there are no grill grids , my korean bbq and cajun shrimps turned out wonderful ! ! ! i have used this pot extensively \( once or twice a week \) for the past three months and it continues to perform superbly
i have had these pans for five years now and i use them almost every night i have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly i would highly recommend them
this thing is a workhorse i use it every day mine 's been going strong for over five years now i just wish they 'd bring back the translucent colors i love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not with the current opaque black or white models that 's not possible
i have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch , but sometimes i sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff i probably use these every other batch or so now
the kitchenaid professional 5 plus \( kv25g0x \) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere we ordered it from amazon , and got the commercial \( km25g0x \) instead we did not want that , so contacted customer service they said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another km25g0x no good , obviously then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise they said they sometimes substituted similar products great
it 's common to see these steamers all over the place and from amazon 's display , this certainly did n't look any different what made me decide to get this was the price and when i opened the box and examined it , i was pleased to find how well made this item is
we have a new puppy and i bought this cleaner when i read the negative reviews i almost returned it unopened for some reason i decided to try it i had just rented an industrial sized rug doctor about three weeks ago to do my carpets i just wanted to try this to see how it would do the dirt and dog hair i got out was amazing it was very easy to put together and to use i recently had shoulder surgery and this was very easy to operate with one arm ! thank you so much
i love to spend my time in the kitchen , but what i do n't like to spend is obscene amounts of money if i'm going to buy something i 'd like to buy high quality so that i do n't have to go buy it in a year or two
after years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender , and having to stop and stir , and stop and stir , and worry about burning out the motor , we now do n't have to worry any more even when all of the fruit we add is frozen , this machine grinds , chops , and smooths with impressive power it 's fairly easy to clean , provided you do n't wait for days , and has a handy pouring valve thing a few recipes are included
i am so pleased with these sheets prior to this purchase , the most thread count i had in my sheets was 600 these 1000 thread count sheets are much more luxurious
this is my second dlc 10 the only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement i have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as i have had it for 20 years
the processor works terrific ! it saves us much time everyday
after reading some of the reviews , i was somewhat reluctant to buy this product , but it went on sale at 3 99 , and i decided to risk it
it 's sort of cheap , but it works quite well the water comes out clean , with no odd taste \( which some filter systems can do \)
this is the best french oven i have ever used it cooks evenly and cleans easily while it is very heavy , that must add to the excellence of its cooking and that 's what i wanted no complaints 5 stars
i am buying a replacement that i had for 15 years it still works but the light went off i never thought they were still making it i tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around 25 i gave up , i was still using my old westclck until today when i found this one on amazon
we have a large family and we use our electric skillet a lot in the past we have purchased the cheaper versions from wal mart they do n't heat evenly , and we were constantly replacing them because the cheap plastic legs or handles would break the cuisinart csk 150 1500 watt nonstick oval electric skillet is awesome ! ! the cooking area is huge \( we can cook 6 pancakes at a time easily \) and the cooking surface heats up evenly it is very heavy , so it does n't scoot around on the counter nice metal handles an base glass lid is also very sturdy with a steam vent it is very beautiful and functional because of the quality of the construction , i believe it will last our family for many years i have not previously recommended any item online before , but i highly recommend this item
i have owned this can opener now for several months and it is by far the best can opener i have ever owned i have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime , but this is just wonderful it is smooth , super easy to attach the can , quiet , and does not splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it 's done cutting like all the other did ! ! ! the detachable parts make it sanitary too , you can put it in the dishwasher ! i ca n't say enough about this opener you will not be disappointed ! !
hey , not to be too redundant but this really is a good can opener i have no problems with it , my wife , who always has problems with can openers has some problems sometimes using it but as she never could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement the knife sharpener is an okay touch , however , if you have good knives i would n't use it i sharpen by hand with an edge pro but hey , it 's a can opener it will sharpen a knife i just would n't put my 100 schaaf golden hamster through , maybe my chicago for a quick fix
i 've never had a nice set of knives before these are great ! they have a nice feel in my hands the only reason i did n't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart the scissors i bought at smart final come apart for easy washing and drying
a dutch oven is one of the most versatile items you can find many people i know are intimidated by cooking with dutch ovens , but when you take a few minutes to learn how , you can use it to cook anything ! it can be used with variety of foods stews , cakes , cobblers , breads , poultry , vegetables \( basically anything you make in a conventional oven \) if you happen to forget to pack your skillet when you go camping , turn over the lid and put it back on the dutch oven voila ! instant skillet type cooking surface ! additionally , this smaller dutch oven stacks well with the 12 inch version , so you can cook more than one course at a time !
the other review is so obviously someone from sentry that i thought i 'd add my two cents my house has n't burned down so i do n't know if this works , but i 've read other articles that say it does it is heavy \( since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire \) , and there is no rubber grips on the bottom , so it can slide around a lot it 's a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box
sentry insulated chest
enjoy your sleeping hours in quality sheets with beautiful butterflies embroidered on the pillow cases top sheets an awesome deal for yourself or a gift for someone you want to bless
this set conducts heat really well and everything heats up fast but be careful not to burn anything which i did the first time using it also it takes a bit of scrubbing if you burn it bt other than that it 's a great product
i know these got poor reviews , as ice cube trays but i used them to freeze my baby 's homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great the lids were a little tricky at first , but as long as you do n't overfill them , you 'll have no problems removing the lids a couple twists of the tray , and the food cubes slid right out ! they were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food
i got this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it no more staining other spatula 's or spoons
so when it came up on my gold box offers , i knew i had to have it ! it is great ! beautiful , sleek and also useful ! it looks great in my yellow kitchen too ! the pitcher is heavy duty without feeling too heavy makes a nice piece on your table during that special dinner at home
i cooked 2 cobblers for our scout troop that even the pickiest eater was coming back for more terrific piece for any campers , practically a must have
i am very impressed with the feel and size of this mug it has a smooth feel , and keeps the coffee tea hot warm i ordered one , but will probably be ordering more ! nice ! o
these bodum glasses are simply amazing there 's no other way to describe a glass out of which i can have my coffee in the morning and ice cold liquids at night
no picture can really do these glasses justice they have nothing aesthetic in common with any other double walled cup i 've ever seen elegant , minimalist , super clear and light as a feather they really keep stuff cold \( or hot , as the case may be \) they 're even dishwasher safe however , they are remarkably fragile i accidentally rapped a spoon on the lip of one and within half an hour , the little crack had spread and the glass was in fragments but if you 're careful with them and keep them away from kids , animals , and , apparently , me , they will serve you well
i ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right but when they arrived i was so pleased they 're larger than i expected and very plush i 've washed them several times and they look as good as when i first opened them it 's really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off
these towels are great ! i was surprised how large they are , but it 's been a while since i bought towels , maybe all new towels are really big these towels are so absorbent , it 's hard to tell when they 've been used because the water just seems to disappear and soft , soft , soft brand new out of the box they feel great again , they 're big , so a litle heavy , but they are wonderful these are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious i do n't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies , they must have been referring to another product , these towels are awesome , no fuzzies , they are very well made
i have used every major brand of cutlery and i can tell you there is no better value than analon knives i have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and i have found that the 100 knives are no better than thr 25 ones the analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price try them you will love them i might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it when this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored a good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping mik
if you like knives that hold their edge , have good balance , and feel more expensive than they really are , this knife 's a smart purchase we bought ours with the intent to get henckels my husband loves to cook and i have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen , especially knives anolon were half the price and every bit as good
we looked in all the local brick and mortar stores for a quality holder with no luck
everyone who comes in and sees this just loves it i'm getting several for christmas presents this years to give to all my friends i mounted mine over the sink because that is where i do most of my slicing and dicing it also keeps my knives sharper because you 're not sliding them in and out of the wood blocks it even holds my knife sharpener
enough said
awesome garlic press for a great price no need to peel garlic and it 's easy to clean

the clock is attractive , well made , easy to mount and a good buy for the money
these knives are excellent quality they hold an edge and are well balanced this oxo set is a real bargain
these are great beer mugs ! i ordered 4 sets of them for myself and 2 for my brother the first thing i noticed when i received them was that they were thick and heavy the bottom is n't completely solid , but has space for a small pocket of air when it 's sitting on the counter it 's inconsequential though , because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs when i saw how nice they were , i actually went back online and bought 2 more and their margarita set which was also rediculously cheap \( 15 for 6 glasses and a picher \) i 've been recomending these mugs to all my friends that drink
it was just what i needed i inherited the mixer but it did n't have the beater so now i have one and it works perfectly
this size is perfect for actually using it gets thrown into the dishwasher and gets used every day love it
these dishes are beautiful and very nice quality , i will be buying more
firstly , i am into high quality at an affordable price , so i thank cuisanart for providing just that in all of their cookware two quarters are the most handy in my kitchen and at least one non stick needs to be available i use mine more and more just for the ease of clean up the interior finish seems durable and shows no signs of damage i would expect it to last a very long time with reasonable care the price is great for the quality you 'll be pleased with your purchase
this scale has worked perfectly for me for the last year or so it is very easy to use it looks great and has a permanent place on our counter i wish all consumer electronic products were designed and built to the same standards as this scale
theres not alot i can say about measuring spoons really they are made to a high standard , durable , easy to clean and dishwasher safe at this price i dont see why you would need to pay more for a set of measuring spoons unless it was for decorative reasons
the zyliss ice cream scoop cuts through the hardest ice cream , which means i no longer have to wait for hubby to get home to have a scoop !
listen to those other reviewers who have sung the praises of this scoop ! the zyliss scoop goes through cold ice cream very well and literally drops off the scoop into the bowl well worth the money how nice to have a tool that works well like others , i 've tried many scoops that did not work frustrating ! ! do yourself a favor stop bending your soup spoons and get a zyliss ice cream scoop
it works great , and it 's small \( 6 high , 5 diameter \) and easy to use may require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave for me 7 minutes for soft , 8 min for medium , and 9 10 min for hard eggs on high power \( 700w microwave \)
oxo designs great products and this is no exception it does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top i just do n't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product it does exactly what it 's meant to do with ease i liked it so much , i bought one for my aunt
i ordered this when it way below thirty bucks a great deal for a workhorse of a fan in the heat of the last month , it 's been going almost 24 hours a day , and it 's not slowed down or stopped yet
initially i was very surprised by how large the tools were they are much bigger than any tool i 've bought previously if you do n't have much space in the kitchen , i 'd think twice about buying these tools however , after using them i think they are quite sturdy and useful eventhough they are large , they are not heavy and sometimes there size is quite helpful you can pick up a whole fried egg with the spatula , for example i am happy with my purchace , because the price was good
i 've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no name cast iron pan that i bought in solvang ten years ago it is very well broken in with a smooth non stick patina in all seven indents i want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon , and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves danish delicacies !
i 've had this can opener 4 more than 5 years have never had a problem ! ! ! i even let my 4 year old niece use it when she stays with me helps me cook never have 2 worry about anything with this one
this is a wonderful can opener ! ! ! i would n't have any other the trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice i hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round , i tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning i have noticed that if i buy the dirt cheap , no name vegetables at the dollar store , the opener has difficulty i guess one should blame the can and not the opener it is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around but then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out if there is no replacement blade , you can bet i will buy another can opener just like this , and if i have to , on ebay !
i have to admit that i was surprised when the rolling pin arrived i'm used to oxo quality , but this is over the top it is a big rolling pin , with an ideal diameter it is also heavy it 's heft helps keep it where it belongs , instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder it has a strong axle , which glides remarkably smoothly , even when the pressure is on the hard non stick surface works very well , and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings the handles are simply the best i have have encountered this is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the good grips promise of quality
i had seen my japanese coworkers carry this thing to work it 's a great lunch bag ! beats brown bagging , because hot foods stay hot , and cold foods stay cold i finally bought one because of the ease of use , did n't want to keep paying for hot lunches , and i can always bring my favorite foods the bottom container is the only leakproof container \( that is my only gripe \) i usually put soup in here the other containers will hold things without sauces very well it 's great because it allows for a large variety of foods \( better nutrition \) i have used bento lunch boxes since i was kid , and this is the best for adults i like asian food , and this type of lunch box accomodates the best
they are working well so far they stain a little when grease gets on them
this makes baking so much easier , things just pop right out the light weight and noiselessness of the product make this a real winner baking just keeps getting easier and easier i have replaced all my bakeware possible with these silicone bakeware items i love them
when i decided to buy this oven , i was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven i stumbled across this item looking for cookware i read all the reviews , thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it boy , am i glad that i did ! ! ! and so is my family the day we received it , i cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack extremely easy all i needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me since then , we have cooked more muffins , a meatloaf , bacon , toast , english muffins , chicken strips , waffles and bratwurst my kitchen does n't heat up like when i use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven it was so easy for my husband to use this also while i was shopping and i just gave him a 15 second class before i left i did n't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods this is my first convection toaster oven , which has replaced the microwave and toaster , and i can assure you we expect to use this oven alot i love the design , the warming tray does just that , even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm it 's great ! the oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance i would recommend this to anyone what a great idea for the kitchen
very good buy for 85 free ship bought this one to replace a smaller black decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5 6 years until controls gave out \( the b d still works , just have to keep the button pressed in \)
overall this is a fine scale one convenient feature is an auto zero function if the scale has been tared and the tare weight removed , rather than displaying a negative weight , the scale automatically re zeros this may be handy most of the time , but sometimes it 's a pain with my old scale , i could tare a partially filled bowl , remove the bowl from the scale , add more goodies , and place it back on the scale to determine the weight of the additional material that does n't work with this scale it rezeros when a tared weight is removed
i hope these things are airtight because i just bought my fourth set i do n't buy the freezer storage containers because i own these they can be used in cooking and freezing so i save on pricey disposable freezer bags the little ones i use to store one package each of corn starch , yeast , baking powder , baking soda , three hamburger patties and to prepare , freeze and bake individual sized servings of salmon fillets
it does the job , cook my sushi rice perfectly and no burn so much better than my old black and decker
i could n't be more satisfied if my stock pot had cost 10 times as much
the aerobed premier raised queen sized bed is a godsend due to a disability , i needed a raised bed that would allow me the convenience of a somewhat normal height bed , so my husband i could camp with other family members at a recent family reunion the aerobed premier raised not only afforded me that ability , but also provided a surprisingly comfortable night 's sleep as well the bed is made of the highest quality material , and did not lose any air
although it 's a 'chicken fryer' , i use it to pan fry everything , and it works amazing ! the depth of the pan allows larger amount of food inside , being stirred without spilling out and the smaller diameter helps to concentrate heat in the pan the nonstick feature truly works , nothing sticks to the pan , even the thick starch
definitely a nice knife i really like the unibody and the blade is very sharp clean cutting knife
i love these little clips they are small in size and useful for hanging a shopping list , a note , and things of this sort their magnets are strong and colors quite pleasant to look at
i got this blender some years ago , i do n't even remember how long , because of the price then my finances got better and promised to myself once it broke i would change it for a nice new chrome steel model but the friggin' thing keeps on going and going , so , i'm stuck with it until who knows when
the polder 5416 97 essential dual leg ironing board is easy to lift and to fold it stores neatly in small spaces it 's sturdy and will last a long time the cover and pad is very colorful
this is the simplest , but one of the best kitchen must haves i have purchased in a long time the peel is whisked of the garlic in seconds easy to clean , easy to store no more garlic hands
i am using this pad on a aerobed , so this wont be a good review for a person using it on a full sized mattress \( i do n't know if it will fit , it looks like it will but i have n't tried it \) however , i can tell you that this is a durable mattress pad it went camping with us without a problem and it washes easily those are important factors to consider
love the pan , the center is so cool , because you can tell when the product is pre heated the center changes and it is so great the pan is almost too big , but it is perfect for everything i can possibly cook in it
this pan suited my needs exactly it 's handle is comfortable to hold and it has nice even heat distribution the handle and the curve of the outside edge make flipping food quite easy
these are the best ones i have seen so far you 'll love the martini design ! a great bargain
i recently broke two of my favorite pieces of corelle baking and serving dishes i looked on several sites and it seemed all i could find was the handleless french style corningware , which i have and find hard to use due to being without handles this bakeware has great handles and i love it i love the chutney on the side , i compared this price with ordering just two piece of the same thing in abundance design and the oblong baking dish separate and it was 10 00 more without the ramkins this was a better value
i like the pistoulet dinnerware and specially the bread plates but after some dishwasher , the paint begin to peel off at least , i got a excellent customer service from pfaltzgraff and they have exchanged the product good advice , dont place them in the dishwasher
i am an avid baker sometimes you need to whip up your egg whites to fold in later having an extra bowl makes this so much easier than transferring to a different type bowl or maybe you are making christmas cookies you can have one batter chilling in the fridge while you are mixing another one it 's well worth the money
i bought this scale back in jan or feb i needed one and after looking around for a while found that i liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display pounds on one side , ounces \( down to the tenth \) on the other side the lb k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and i do n't find it inconvient down there this scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while i'm in the middle of measuring because of previous complaints to that effect when i first got mine i timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2 5 min before it did i also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish , very clean lines and is easy to clean too , just a quick wipe down and i'm done as a note to alton brown fans this is his scale of choice on good eats the price tag may have you shying away but i assure you that its worth every penny i would not trade mine for anything !
i do a lot of stir frying , using one pan to do many dishes as a result i needed a pan that had non stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop when pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18 10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick the heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides , this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides the sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying the height is also good for small item deep frying the steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well , falling back easily into the pan quality pans tend to be heavy , all clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to it also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons all types \( including metal \) of utensils can be used with it this is a solid , handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use it is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long , long time
i first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker , then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you
this timer screams quality ! lovely , easy to use , and a great shriek to it \( you 'll def hear it while in another part of the house ! \) one of its best features is that you can set the time just by tapping the particular numbers of the time needed the best timer i 've ever used or seen i got two ! \)
i find this iron very easy to use the multiple steam holes makes ironing easier and faster i have a small problem with it spitting water i have tried using 1 2 tap and 1 2 spring water and i have tried adjusting the steam flow , but it still tends to spit overall , i am very pleased with this iron
this is a great iron it 's quite heavy , but i like that it really gets out the wrinkles i do n't even mind ironing any more
good knife , sharp , cuts well however , i'm partial to the kitcheaid chef 's knife
i adore my emile henry pie dish it was my first piece of emile henry and worth every cent the dish is beautiful and durable it cleans up nicely , you do n't have to worry about scratching and sticking is not a problem
it vacuums dog hair like nothing else i 've used but you have to clean it every other time you use it the cord could use 10' or so in additional length the handle retracts nicely and it 's light weight makes it easy to move around i think the thing i like about it the most is the narrow suction strip or whatever it 's called i think the high power motor coupled with the narrow strip equates to superior suction but a little more time in use
i am really pleased with this purchase this cookware far exceeded my expectations it 's heavyweight but not too heavy i just love the cool touch handles i would recommend this set very highly if you cook alot like i do you will be more than happy with this set
i have been very happy with this cookware it is very well made , heavy and sturdy this is the most expensive set i have ever bought , and the difference is stunning the pans heat very quickly and get much hotter than my old pans i have had to change my cooking style to accommodate the better pans i like being able to put them in the oven and not worrying about caring for a \( possibly \) toxic non stick coating well worth the money
i have n't had a chance to use them yet as the holidays are just approaching , but they look good and sturdy if the cheesecakes come out well , i 'll know then , but so far , so good they delivered on time too
farberware 18 10 stainless steel cookware is a good line i had this cookware at one time , and i can recommend it , especially for use on gas burners unlike calphalon cookware , it can go in the dishwasher however , to keep the finish gleaming , you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads the 8 quart stockpot with lid is a kitchen essential
so far this has been a great product i 've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea so far it has held up great this carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours when i leave the water in it for 24 hours , the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it
we received another set for our wedding , but i am considering taking it back to macy 's where this calphalon 10 piece set was on sale for 399 00 this weekend same set , same pieces ! ! i ca n't believe it these pans feel great are durable but wo n't weigh you down while you are cooking the analon advanced brand i got is so heavy ! !
saeco is great full automatic esspreso cafe maker , with buildin grinder and automatic disposal best in class for pric
for years we have used the mr coffee iced tea makers and have purchased two of them this time around we chose to get the hamilton beach 40911 2 qt iced tea maker even though i we have n't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the hamilton beach method of brewing tea over the mr coffee first of all the taste \( using luzianne family tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the mr coffee makers also one very large drawback with the mr coffee maker is that the basket , for the bags , sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir , where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher because hamilton beach placed the basket directly inside the pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker also due to ridges in the bottom of the mr coffee maker it 's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it this feature alone makes the hamilton beach a better buy over the mr coffee but i thought , before my purchase , that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both lipton and luzianne family tea bags the hamilton beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste is better on the mr coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the hamilton beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket \( mild , medium , strong \) , we usually use medium
i am very impressed with this set the pans are of heavy guage steel and have rolled edges i had 3 pounds of chicken on the cookie sheet and with a one handed lift the pan did not flex as my other pans did , again heavy guage steel the handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees other brands that i have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above keep in mind i am not a cook and by my very method of cooking \( set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning \) i am very hard on pans of any kind a very high quality product that i would have gladly paid 50 bucks for by the way , the cooling rack is nonstick as well
very smooth operation my complaint is that i have already spotted a bit of rust , but careful washing and drying should alleviate the problem
i needed a set of knives like yesterday i had a set of chicago cutlery knives they lasted 2 years the blades chipped and resharpen them were impossible because of the chipping , the handles faded and they had rust spots and i am not hard on knives i even hand washed them most of the time so i bought these knives because they were henckles and the never needed sharpening i have had them 3 months they are perfect for me they are made in china
calling it short is a misnomer it 's not that short it 's an average size it has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store the turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods do n't always want to cooperate but i'm pleased with it i would n't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle takes up too much room in my drawer
with the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us we like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing but you must use their carafe with this maker you can use your own mug and if the carafe breaks \( and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes \) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container i sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher sure this maker is n't fancy , but i just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that does n't take up lots of counter space i have n't had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker
we bought this sweeper instead of the dyson , because con report had it rated higher we paid a lot less and we are very happy with this product
i 've had lots of coffemakers over the years , and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup it ran over the side and made a mess , unless you poured it very slowly i saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it it is great i will never own anything else i have been looking for one to replace my old one , only because the heating element is dirty rusty looking \( my wife does n't like it \) in fact i'm going to buy one right now on amazon , as i 've looked at a few stores and the new black and decker models i have seen , do n't have the dripless pouring spout
this coffee maker is so simple to use any husband can do it ! and , it makes a mighty fine cup of joe at that ! shipping was free , and it arrived in perfect shape in a timely matter highly recommended
these oval dishes are just the right size for sides , and they stay warm a very long time besides looking great i have served mashed potatoes , sweet potatoes , all kinds of squash and even bay and sea scallops everything looks better in these also bought several for my children a fine addition to your le creuset collection
what can you say about a blender \?
this model is an improvement over the older pot shape it is easier to clean and use i wish it was available in local stores i had to order it online which means extra for shipping
this is a fantastic idea for teaballs sleek and stylish , this set is also practical
i love these oven mitts they have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator , or other metal surface they are not as cumbersome as the really long , heavily molded ones i bought them for all of my grown children and they all love them too
i have been using the coffee maker for over 3 months now , and i love it ! i like that i can use either the caraffe or the travel mugs
i have had this for almost a year , and for the money i cannot recommend a better product i would buy another
in my opinion
when i ordered this saucepan , i did n't realize how high the quality would be when i opened the box and first lifted the saucepan , i was immediately impressed with the weight and quality each time that i use this pan to heat up foods , i am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook water boils very quickly lastly , the engraved measuring lines for liquids are extremely helpful all in all , the best saucepan that i 've owned
i really like the hampers they do n't take up a lot of floor space and with three , i can separate the laundry the handles make it easy to move them they are a little deeper than my arms are long \( i'm short \) but i can tilt them to empty them would have liked having an assortment of colors to choose from
my boyfriend and i live in a two room apartment there is not a lot of storage space i ordered two of these hampers and the first one just came i put his clothes in and he still has half of the hamper left i am so glad to get something that is sturdy and large now we will have a place to put our clothes
the most important quality of this tea pot is that it pours well it does not drip nor does the water overflow the spout when filling the pot i am very happy with my purchase
these sheets feel like you want them too heavy and soft worth every penny this is the second time i 've bought them from amazon i ca n't see any reason to buy any other kind
i just recently purchased this little knife set at a local department store and paid 10 00 for the set i love these things ! at amazon 's price of 3 99 i added a second set to another order and i am eagerly awaiting their arrival i would recommend these knives to anyone they are such a good deal , in my opinion
the vacu vin wine saver works great , it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks also it is very easy to use
this is the only grill i 've ever had , so i guess i ca n't compare it to others , but for me this grill has been just great it is super easy to use and clean it has given me no problems at all i recommend it
have to say ditto to all the reviewers below i owned another brand before but it was n't nearly as powerful at least one reviewer expresses concern about keeping the blades clean , so i must note that the instructions indicate everything but the motor housing which detaches from the blade element can go in the dishwasher !
i'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching my persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched i think next time i 'll order them as individual place settings as they were n't packed well amazon will give me a 20 discount for keeping them
this is my favorite knife it cuts very nicely and has a great feel mine is still sharp after 2 years of use
i bought this egg cooker as a gift for my son , but i have used it and really like it it soft boiled the eggs perfectly and is also very convenient to clean the timer is also loud enough to hear
had this oven for about a month now , and very satisfied nice brushed stainless steel finish , solid construction was a bit larger than i anticipated , but still fits nicely on my countertop the controls could be a bit more elegantly designed , but overall very pleased with this oven my favorite thing about it is how fast it cooks and toasts
this cake form is phenominal ! after spaying it with the flour butter pam , my cakes are flawless i have never been disappointed with how my cakes have turned out with this pan not one corner of the pattern was soft every detail comes out crisp and so very clean i have bought other pans from this maker and only have good things to say about them
i love this pan it 's a 10 in my eyes when it arrived i washed it with mild soap and water dried it , sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven 37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked i turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan i'm going to give this pan as gifts in the future
i used la cloche to make bread with , specifically san francisco sourdough , with spectacular results the crust was crisp but chewey , and i could not imagine baking another loaf without it but after i used it the first time , the bottom developed a crack after a second use , the crack became so large that i will not use it again for fear it will break during cooking
i love to bake i really love to bake bread my specialty is sourdough so now i have 3 strikes against me , that is , until i found la cloche
first of all , they are n't really intended for the novice user , but they are perfect for the long run the wooden ones will rot before you ever get skilled with them , but these stainless steel ones will take a licking and keep on picking
my mother is korean and so i grew up using stainless steel chopsticks apparently they 're quite popular in korean households as well as stainless steel rice bowls you might have seen them , the ones with the stainless lids \?
i have this and mini pans and muffin pans all silicone they are great the biggest problem is that the bread tends to expand the sides of the soft pan so the sides are a bit wider i never oil the pans and the bread pops out easily the muffins too ususally since the recipe often has oil in it
a wonderful product everything cooks very evenly no sticking so easy to wash and store also
i 've had this model of the shark for a couple of months now and it is working great it has a powerful suction compared to my duster buster i have had no problems with the battery so far and it seems to last the adertised 15 minutes i too concerned over the hepa filters you can do a decent job cleaning it and i plan to clean it well with my shopvac to extend the life the vacuum and accessories fit nicely into the stand i would definitely recommend this product for quick vaccums around the house and in the car
my husband drinks coffee continuously whenever we are in the car , i'm always after him not to spill his coffee and i constantly have to clean up the inevitable spills we could never find a good cup that would fit in the cup holder so the spills were always on the floor or in his lap this cup does spill if it 's tipped over \( i do n't think any cup will ever be completely spill proof \) but it fits in the cup holder and therefore does n't spill as easily i bought two , one for him and one for me \( i drink ice water and tea \) and they both fit together nicely side by side in our cars cup holder they keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for long periods of time i have purchased loads of cups over the 34 years of our marriage and this has to be the best by far i would highly recommend this item for everyone !
i really wanted a 5 quart pot and would n't want to spend a lot of this turned out to be a great buy it is a very good quality product the non stick surface seems very well coated it 's very versatile for us \( a family of 4 \) i am very pleased and satisfied with the product
he just looks away from where the spray emits and barks again !
having read the other reviews of this product on this site , i decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered i ordered three of these products from this site , and when they arrived , not a single one of them worked at all they were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested , these products are completely useless although i have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects , i would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website , that if the product does not work , it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged thus , your credit card will still be billed , your dogs will still be barking , and you may get stuck with products that are worthless
sometimes it sprays when she barks , most of the time it does n't so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it 's not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine \( my children found this amusing
this item is cheaply made and i sent it back the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side , it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left , it plopped down to the left it could n't keep the right time
initially , my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking , but after a couple of days they acted like they did n't even hear the sound now , they are back to bark all you want
i bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier he did n't even notice it was there i put it near his crate and it still did n't stop him from barking i pushed the manual button and still nothing it promises to stop annoying barking , but it did n't stop my dog for one minute it was a complete waste of my money
our dogs did n't even notice it we have three small terriers and i thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers i was wrong the kept on barking
read the description carefully it states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone my dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it would n't trigger matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand even then it did n't go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower
i have had my super bark free for 3 years never really worked the way i hoped but i spent so much on it i keep trying well now it does n't work ca n't turn it off and it does n't cycle when the dog barks
super bark free did n't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor 's dog 's extremely irritating ear piercing loud barking he merely ignored it \( though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet \) i'm mad that i wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product
the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't ! this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt what a useless thing i'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor this thing certainly does n't do it ! if you 're looking to buy this thing , look again there must be something better if not just your regular broom
the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but , it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries
i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy
there are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed this is one of them 1 quality it 's made cheaply , and even before it breaks , it 's flimsiness does not inspire confidence 2 resistance the levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks , \( many will be unchallenged right from the beginning \) the standard if the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue , you need more resistance 3 compared to crunches there 's a reason why crunches are done lying down the weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance , whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort , as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up much of what makes the ab crunch machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it , not your muscles working this little piece of plastic does n't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides \( you may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect , but you can get exactly this effect , or better , without any equipment at all ! just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so \) of course , by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly huge a hassle lying down \( \? \? \) to do crunches is , we 've reached the real problem this thing is designed to avoid effort it seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort unfortunately , exercise is effort , and the more you avoid effort , the less exercise you get
i have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for 20 \( not on sale either regular price \) same siz
the corningware dish is great , my 1 star is not for the item , it is for dynadirect they are horrible ! item was backordered , but they never told me and charged my credit card when i called they finally told me it was backordered and i ask that they cancel the order and refund my money bad , bad servic
i was really hopeful about this product working i have four dogs , ages 2 through 8 i tried and tried to teach them how to use this product , but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button they just ignored the paw and would n't ever put their paw on it to even touch it
this is very misleading this item is only half of the package after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work very disappointed in amazon for allowing this
as this is a consumable food product , i 'd like to know what each color is made of \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \?
i am very disappointed these flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store i ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked i buy roses alot , and i know what a fair cost is for good quality if you 're paying less than 30 , beware
being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons firstly , there is no auto shut off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries this light is also extremely fragile over a couple of years i went through 7 of these ! i would not recommend this light for the amount you spend on the never ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply , and the constant new purchases after it breaks , you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises \( available at barnes nobel come on and get it in stock amazon ! \) it is terrific ! it has a clock with an alarm and a timer you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes at that time you can extend the minutes if you do n't do so , for example you 're sleeping , it will automatically shut off it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light
why does this light cost 30 \? for this price and supposedly a bunch of design awards , i find this light to be of extremely poor quality the connection between the chord and the a c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension the chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on i am still looking for a better alternative , but for the price , this light is n't worth the investment
i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper , even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee
the can has to be 100 dent free for this to work if you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can , this thing wo n't open your product a great idea , but this needed a little more refinement
i bought this electric kettle and while it did heat water very quickly , once i opened the lid the whole pot of water reeked of plastic needless to say , the water was not drinkable
i bought these towels to wash my car , so i wanted a thick soft 100 cotton nap what i received was on par with the thin towels you 'd find at cheap hotel not thick or soft on the plus side , the sewed in tag did say 100 cotton and it was made in the usa
this product does separate the fat but small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant mine cracked the first time i used it and after the second use it had to go in the trash can
once upon a time , not too long ago , they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator this meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice , plus the tasty bits , instead of , as with this product , having to strain the sauce first \( for the bits \) and then sacrifice some of the sauce \( a small amount to be sure \) , lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well this product is really just a step away from spoon and ice cube , and not a big step , considering that it 's not a complete solution if the cooks 's purpose were to collect the fat e g , chicken schmalz free from juices , it would present the same problems
works well on carpets not to well anywhere else the hose attachment is horrible , the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum , and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off i have 2 dogs and 3 cats and i need to be able to clean the furniture also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood , it was not pulled into the bag very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets
the international eversharp line is henckels low end , stamped stainless line it is not carbon steel it is not hand forged it does not compare to the other henckels lines which are you get what you pay for these are cheap knives
i decided to give this product a shot some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you do n't overstuff them still not true ! a large bag re inflated when i put 2 standard pillows in it so i took out 1 pillow and tried again , and the bag was nowhere near being full it seemed to work all right , but the next morning the pillow had re inflated ! and if you buy the bags with the zippers , the zippers come off easily , they make sealing more difficult , and one even tore a hole in the bag i purchased straight from asseenontv com , but their return policy looks a little weird i'm not sure if i 'll get a refund also be careful if you order straight from asseenontv com i upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later ! i guess the product was just too good to be true
this is the worst basting brush i have ever encountered at first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time i washed it \( although it 's dishwasher safe , it failed to come clean in there , even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it is n't spotless , but i think i pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process \) it also does n't stand up to any heat , i use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things \( at about 375 degrees \) becuase i do n't like the residue left by pam , and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time i also do n't like the good grips in general \( these were a gift \) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous the handle is much too small for this size mug if you can get your finger through the small hole , your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware the first and only time my family used these mugs , two of us burned ourselves
last year , i bought a pizza stone from pampered chef it was a rousing success with my family for the 5 of us , however , one stone was not enough and i wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time sadly , the product did not come through my pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off i tried going against the directions and did n't preheat the stone the second time it stuck even worse ! the pizza did n't get fully done in the middle , while the pampered chef pizza was perfect both times i will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from pampered chef you get what you pay for ! !
i thought i was getting a true cooking stone but it is only a bread stone cannot cook other foods on it i thought i was getting something similar to pampered chef cooking stone where i could cook meat , cookies , etc and it seasoned the stone as it was used if all you want is pizza or bread this may be the item but it is very limited in use for the amount of space it takes up in the cabinet
purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it the heating plate under the pot started to rust the pot leaks every time it 's poured it 's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water we purchased this unit because of the cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe we will not purchase another
i have a kitchenaid model k5sswh heavy duty mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl i regrettably only read the editorial review and bought these covers thinking i can snap them on i use them to loosely cover my attachments now , but i could have used anything for that
as shannon says , kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments but be warned these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl ! i purchased a new artisan mixer ordered these to go along with it , but they are too small they do not fit the artisan or ksm90 mixer bowls models they fit are kbc5n , k5ss , ksm5 only
started having problems with hot water spraying out and burning those who stand in front contacted melitta and they said they are aware of the issue and i have to purchase a pod holder adapter due to the pods are too thick i questioned charging people for something they manufactured and were notified was defective , the dummy on the phone did n't have an answer i do not recommend this product maybe a class action is due
i ordered this after reading that it includes 6 18 ounce bowls this is bad advertising i ordered 2 sets and only received 2 bowls after i wrote to customer service and asked for the additional 10 bowls per the offer amazon refused to send them and thanked me for pointing out an error in 2 days amazon has not even corrected the ad beware of this product and offer and know that amazon has not made good on its offer i have ordered many products from this site , but will be more skeptical in the future , and will only order an item if it is an individual item with a name brand that i can track
i am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so i bought this to make it at home making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions \( i did n't watch the video \) the frother even works well the problem i had was with the flavor the manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time , but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing i had best results making just over one shot at a time , but the flavor was still burned and flat in the end , i used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker
everything sticks to these pans ! i cannot get off the potato residue and i'm probably just going to throw them away
i have not received this item yet i tracked this item and it seems that it was delivered aug 12 to phoenix , az i live in oklahoma and that was the address on the shipment what can be done about this \? thank yo please let me hear from you soon l jackson
i ca n't believe this is a rowenta product ! if you decide to disregard the reviews , here are some things from the owners manual \( which i read before using the iron and followed to the letter \) to give you an idea how temperamental high maintenance this item is
i just got one of these nifty looking canisters , but mine
the cofee carafe keeps brew hot for hours ! i have had 4 spillages and alot of mess to clean up because the filter must be aligned properly or else ! i also cannot figure out how to program one of the most important features for me buying i really wish i could send this back
despite my by the book care of these knives , i still get rust stains that are nearly impossible to get off i do not have that problem with other knives in my collection , but these clean up like cheap steel not very attractive , and you do n't want to eat with them
love those irobot products and everything they 're capable of doing in fact , this was my third purchase , but my first remanufactured product what a headache ! the product worked correctly just three times , then died both technical support and customer service from irobot were helpful and prompt , but still took weeks to resolve the issues i tried a different way of recharging , which did n't work then they replaced the battery , but that still did n't solve the problem ultimately i had to send the product back , then waited more than a month for a replacement , which was on backorder finally , they substituted a different model , and which works just as advertised i 'd never buy another remanufactured model but i still believe in irobot
fiesta scarlet is a beautiful color and the sugar and creamer with tray is really great mine arrived broken and i had difficulty returning it so i remain disappointed and unwilling to try again
please note that i have several henckel knives that i really like , so this is definitely not a anti henckel biased review
terrible ergonomics ! it was so difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time my hand was aching by the time i 'd carved the brisket i 've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance
this grill is better in theory than practice i'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really is n't practical for steaks except very thin ones it 's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches i have n't tried some of the other recipes so i ca n't really comment on anything else it is easy to clean , so that 's a plus
the only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing this juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week \( for two people \) at 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink i considered getting another one to have spare parts then i scraped that idea and got a real juicer besides being cheaply made it should also be priced cheaper also the blade takes a while to clean
and when i requested a return amazon said they would send me a return label , but did n't nor did they respond to my email advising i never received the return label this is my last order from amazon
i felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set the grill cover started to desapair , and the last time i cooked a stek using this set , the paint sticked to the meat , leaving black spots it started to show deteriorazion and everytime i washed i have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon
purchased this set and on the first use the non stick finish , started peeling off not worth buying
the temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected ! over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it this means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything \( which granted is not everyone \) last time i buy an oven thermometer in which the markings do n't sit behind a glass face !
i could n't wait to get the dyson root 6 i 've had my dyson dc 07 for 4 years and i love it , so i figured the mini version would be fantastic i have 3 dustbusters \( one on each floor \) and i was looking forward to the dyson version , which i was convinced would be top notch
i was looking for a springform pan for a particular recipe that called for 3 sides i was delighted when i saw that you had one so i ordered it the item was misrepresented as the sides are like any other springform with 2 sides i am sure it is a good pan , but it didnot meet my expectations
i just bought this fan and it is too loud ! even on its lowest setting , the noise is a bit much it does put out a stiff breeze , but i'm not sure it 's worth it my black and decker tower fan is better
had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction \( it locked but would not unlock \) amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly however , the lock on the second one does not work properly , either \( it does n't lock \) , though i will keep it , since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home this item is a good way of storing blades and disks , but unless cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism , do n't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it
i 've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under normal use something goes wrong at some point , and they just do n't read right anymore
when our wonderful cuisanart four slice toaster finally died , we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk , because it seemed most similar to the old one what a mistake !
the toast was black on setting 4 , black and dark tan on setting 3 , and dark tan and untoasted on setting 2 this is appalling performance for such an expensive toaster , and not worthy of cuisinart
i purchased one like this last december on the 13th month i owned it it began to leak from the spout i emailed breville 2 3 times and they never even responded ! their web site states they always respond within 3 days do n't believe them and do n't buy a product from this company
i ordered 3 \( 2x \) sets of these so that i would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets
you truly get what you pay for in this case we bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house in the dryer , you need to check the lint trap frequently , as they shed like mad they are not smooth and cozy , they have a very high coefficient of friction and it 's sorta hard to scootch around on them i would not recommend
product not even worth a penny impossible to use after the first wash wont recommend to anyon
i thought it was a good deal to order a factory reconditioned roomba 4210 discovery to save some money , however
when it works , this blender does a fine job , and looks great however , our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year we sent it in , after many calls to customer service , and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement the replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke during that 2 years , we figured out that our extra set of blades did n't fit in bottom ring properly , and allowed fluid to pour through the motor great i should have save up to buy a vitamix instead
on 8 15 06 , i purchased and irobot roomba scheduler within one month of purchase , it failed completely and would not work at all on the irobot website , it claims that their customer service department is open 24 7 , and they guarantee a reply to an email within 24 hours i sent an email , and i never heard anything back from them at all after a week , i called their technical support line , and i waited on hold for 38 minutes before being able to speak to a technician , who swiftly determined that my unit was defective and needed to be replaced i was told to mail in my defective unit and that another one would be shipped to me it is now 11 9 2006 and i have received nothing and heard nothing from irobot do not purchase one of these units unless this kind of product unreliability and abysmal technical support is appealing to you
at first i was pretty happy with the grater , but after a few days of use i started to notice that i was getting small shavings of metal as well as shredded cheese i am no longer using it and would not recomend it to anyone
well , i'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater yes , it will grate cheese , but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1 4 of an inch this allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through also , for harder cheeses this means you 're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated
i bought this to replace my old mouli grater which finally bit the dust big mistake it is sturdy and reasonably well designed , but the grating surfaces barely work at all , or at least mine did n't to get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle , so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese i tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on jarlsberg neither drum worked satisfactorily that may be because it is made in china where hard western style cheese is nearly unknown yeah i know it says miu france but the box clearly says made in china i finally got so mad i threw it out in frustration
i have the artisan kitchenaid mixer and this cover is too bulky for it it is too long at the bottom and just unpleasing to the eye would recommend just leaving your mixer uncovered hope this was helpful
well , i just got my blender , real excited to use it , filled it up with the ingredients , flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking , badly , and then died i turned it off and tried to turn it on again , and all it did was make a grumbly noise so i am sending it back and sticking with my old hamilton that i have had for 9 years why did i quit using it in the first place 20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie 79 for this waring and it crashed and burned on me my advice is it looks nice , but it is n't worth the money , especially since it died right away on me oh well
when i bought this item i attempted to test it in hot water my only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which was n't accurate it appeared to register better than the grocery store model however , when using it to make chocolate fudge , by the time it registered 225 degree 's , the fudge was thickening in the pan , not a pretty sight i used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction it has a 5 year limited warranty for replacement i do n't feel it 's worth the trouble to send back as i do n't want another of this brands products , ever it 's going in the garbage as i attempt to find an accurate , well calibrated candy thermometer
got this product by mistake from chef 's tools grinding mechanism is made of plastic and it does not grind pepper have the black magnum and is the best peppermill ever , \( thats why we wanted a second one for the kitchen \) our black peppermill did not come from chef 's tools
discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use as a smoothie addict , shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily , i'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance \( is a full year 's use asking too much \? \) the braun burned out in the first 90 days , faster than my black and decker , oster , even hamilton beach \( though it lasted longer than back to the basics \) the best thing i can say for the braun is that it does n't have the impossible to clean push buttons \( always look for a single switch , a knob , or a touch pad \) otherwise , their shavers have served me better , mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes
i use a blender to do two things 1 \) make smoothies and 2 \) stir batter for crepes
this citrus juicer has a very good external design the problem is that 30w is not enough power for doing the job well normal orange presure stops de motor ! the transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts , so they broke easily these parts broke after a dozen of uses in my case , so i do not recommend this machine
ok so this isnt a review , but a question i have on this product where is the instruction manual to this thing \? what do the lines above the alcohol names mean there are two , three , even four lines above some of the alcohol names does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink please answer for it has left many of us flustered thank you very muc
this mixer runs too fast , even in it 's lowest setting the beaters tend to throw food out of the mixing bowl uncontrolable would not suggest purchasing
warped badly upon receipt too much of a pain to return it it is already in the tras
while seeing this pasta bowl on sale for 4 99 here at amazon com , i did n't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago what a great price ! i was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day the packing is nice and secure the color was so vivid at the first sight , but after i took a hard look , almost half of the bowls are defective ! ! un colored white spot , un glazed bubble holes , black dots stain inside of the bowl even defective spots are tiny , but they are so obvious they just do n't look good with those flaws on them ! i was so disappointed and frustrated as i went through all the 21 bowls i ordered by the way , the black bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl i will say those are probably the factory secondary products it turned out i have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness , such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls of course , all the black ones are returned since they are no name with the bad quality no one will even believe they are fiestaware ! !
tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice , i was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently no such luck with this one ! first , it uses a different measuring system for the rice \( rice cooker cup \) than it does for the water \( regular measuring cup \) , so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it 's back to guesswork again ! worse though , is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed , so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam for those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great one might figure out how to adjust the measuring , but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output since water boils at the same temperature , fast or slow , it makes no sense
i hardly ever write reviews but i felt the need to on this item i bought the senseo deluxe last night , i wanted the deluxe model so that i could also make tea the setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition here 's the problem , i brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee ever and i'm not even a big coffee drinker to make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee who drinks only 4 ounces of anything you would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak which is wear the waste of money comes in the senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast i personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning i originally bought the senseo because i didnt want to spend tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get now the tassimo is great i 've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son everyone likes it good luck everyone
this was an excellent item for about 3 uses then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth miu france says this is not their problem just buy a new one with an attitude like that and product failure so quickly yes , i will buy a different brand and avoid miu france product
it 's too bad i really wanted this to work , since i love soft serve but after using it twice i donated to goodwill
the black decker ic200 arctic twister ice cream mixer is a product that you must not purchase it is a total waste of money it 's designed to make soft serve ice cream at home the are not enpough pro 's and way too many cons the only pro it makes soft serve ice cream when ever you want
i had a black and decker processor that i got as a wedding present over twenty years ago , and it never let me down once when it was time to get a new one , i got this 1500 thinking that it 's a b d and i ca n't go wrong well as as soon as i tried to grate some cheese the plastic ring on the shredder grater blade snapped off the next time i used it a metal pin in the pastic cover that holds the blade securely broke the plastic groove it was in too bad b d went down the drain through the years
i received my food processor for christmas i had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding i decided to see if i could buy accessories for mine online i could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the power pro ii i was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews i came across during my search despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out , i decided to keep it i used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working ! i strongly recommend not purchasing this food processor
i read the reviews after i purchased it we made grated cheese \( turned out so so \) and tried to make hummus but it would n't even turn the blade and was very , very noisy i'm returning it to target tomorrow if it ca n't stand up to crushing a few cooked beans then it 's no good to me
i purchased this black decker food processor on 12 30 04 at target i used it the first time to grate cheese and loved it however , i used it tonight for only the 2nd time to chop some onion and celery and it started smelling hot smoke started pouring out the back i will be returning to target tomorrow and not purchasing another black decker kitchen appliance
i love the colors and the heat resistance but found the wooden handle on one spatula rough and splintery also the spatula is showing nicks on the edges of the silicon don't understand because i don't use it on rough edged bowls or pans
if i could give this thing a negative number , i would i just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because , after i had thrown away the bags the sugar came in , i could not get the z845 to work what a mess ! i had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen
these dishes , first of all , are just beautiful the white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous that said , be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them they break horribly easily and the cleanup , well , we just wo n't go there i 've had mine for 10 years and now i'm down to just two of the serving pieces they break very easily in the oven , in the cabinet , you name it , it 's gone if you 're looking for a better one , go for the le creuset la poterie line , or just grab a longaberger one they 're definitely worth it because you 'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece i hate trying to clean these after using them so i just do n't use them anymore for anything but to mix items that way , nothing gets baked on them and i am not breaking nails scouring off the mess i definitely recommend getting something else
we registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first and second box we picked up it 's a very attractive set too bad it ca n't actually contain food due to broken corners , ca n't be washed in a dishwasher , ca n't be used on the stove , and ca n't be used to broil ! you ca n't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee , which is why i wanted them additionally , target does n't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise i realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too , but i just thought i 'd point out that the corningware does n't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken
the blender part that holds the blade broke the second time i used it to crush ice the food processor part works ok , but the major problem is it 's extremely loud it 's beyond the pain level it 's so loud , i have to use hearing protection or my ears are ringing for 15 minutes afterwards it 's louder than my circular saw
i picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it the bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that i own i have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail it might be hard to see from the picture , but the holes for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser the slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas i imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product in my case they make me want to break it
i had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely the rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter , even with daily cleaning sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night , very noisily , until i put a timer on it to turn off at night it was very diffult to clean , even with daily inspection
great idea , horrible execution disgusting to clean , rake gets clogged there are much better options litter robot is well worth the extra cost
at first it looked like it was going to work great \( when the litter was clean \) after a day or so , it was n't cleaning very well i got better litter and it started working better , but still not great litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake after about two weeks of use , the rake stopped moving backwards i tried to fix it , but it just wo n't go in reverse overall , this was a big waste of time and money i'm not even going to try to get another one a good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean it 's too bad as it had a promising beginning do not buy
i loved this bread machine , but it broke after owning it for about three years my husband took it apart to try to fix it , but could not repair it it was making bread and just turned off we could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem we now have to replace it it worked great until it just stopped working i think a breadmaker should last longer then three years also , i did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough , so i could n't just program it and leave the house
i followed breakin instructions as written on pg 3 the clear see thru top warped unit works , but is ugly i contacted salton and was told my unit was out of warranty , too old ! i mailed copies of my invoice no response i gave up i was very happy with your service , but wonder if driving to walmart might have been better
the information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose does not fit hoovers with a hepa system it only fits hoovers with product 's beginning u53 , u54 , u64 i ordered it along with a new windtunnel that has a hepa system , since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people unfortunately , it does not state that these people \( now including me \) have to return the hose because it does not fit all windtunnels so be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy
upon opening the box i found that the information given in the buying information for this product did not reflect the actural product for one thing it only fits unright windtunnel models that use bags this hose is for models beginning with u53 , u54 and u64 only
i bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle this implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design
i use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco you need to put in 1 2 the water that you are supposed to , wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over a real mess with rice it looks ok , but it just is n't the quality item you would expect with the name cuisinart the price is also reasonable , so its not the end of the world it might be better for things that do n't require as much water or cook time \( like white rice \)
bought one recently from a mervyns sale rice burned especially at the bottom \( black crunchy \) so i returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective nope , did the same thing so next go around , i added more water , but still the rice tasted funny a burned taste although the rice did n't burn as much this time for the cost and design , i was hoping this would be a great rice cooker design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord , however , this cooker ca n't even perfom its main purpose just plainly cook rice without burning it yes , i did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup hopefully they 'll improve it better yet , maybe krups can design a better abd sleek looking yet working rice cooker
i bought this in october , 2004 because i wanted something small for my kitchen you cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker now , it shuts off mid way and i have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it hopefully the powers that be will read these comments and make improvements
i ended up returning this because every time i tried it with brown rice it burned the rice i even tried doubling the recommended water amt for brown rice and it still burned
air purifiers were recently reveiwed by consumer reports magazine they are quite ineffective and can be dangerous to your health for further info , read article in consumer reports
i had a hard time with this product the item does not cut the dough well and the ravioli kept opening as a result of this in my opinion , i like the size of a 12 count ravioli maker better this 10 count makes ravioli thats too large
i have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother she had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime when i found the kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere 4 97 at my local sears , i snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen
i am a major fan of le creuset pots and have a number of them but i must say that their kettle is not up to par
i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best only problem is that they rust ! ! ! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic
i have to echo what was said , cheap not up to what you would expec
these sheets are not quality they are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them the jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior they are not a bargain
the colour is pretty but the sheets shrink quite a lot after washing \( in cold water \) i bought a queen set for a full bed and they still do n't fit properly after careful washing i would recommend buying a king set for a full bed this was my first experience with cotton jersey sheets so i did n't know what to expect but i would n't buy them again
this is not caphlon ! ! ! you can buy this at bed bath and beyond for 10 ! !
in theory , this is a good machine it did , in fact , work as advertised for a brief time then it started to smell all of the urine , drinks , vomit , whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet , starts to pool under the holding tank as it festers there , the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house this , to an extent , is simply a nuisance bad smell and extra clean up of the machine itself until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet , making more mess than you started with the first time this happened , bissell customer service sent a replacement unit we started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it bissell only wants to send us another \( no doubt defective \) unit so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky , urine leaking , mess maker , do n't buy this product !
we purchased the cuisinart smartpower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties it 's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop , but very poor quality gear drive after a couple dozen uses , the motor gear wheel broke , apparently a common problem on these cuisinarts , as noted by other reviewers cuisinart customer service is worthless it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it
airbake products are horrible ! i have used the cookie sheets multiple times and i have had nothing but problems there products over brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans i have better luck using my old cheap non stick bakeware than airbake buyer beware ! if you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
awkward handles and lightweight feel bought as a gift and had to be returned chicago cutlery has better lines
i used this press about 4 5 times during the 5 years i owned it the cookie shapes came out well , but after a few uses , the plastic ring around the barrel cracked this year that same plastic part broke entirely , making the press unusable a critical engineering materials defect like the other reviewer \( dec 2005 \) , i too am now in the market for an all metal press
i have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have all chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well i have re ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results they say they are microwave safe but after the first few uses , the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand \( or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest ! \) and the food liquid inside stays cold i am so disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes
the unique design of this dinnerware line is lost in the low quality earthenware body this low fired clay body breaks easily , is bulky to handle and is just plain disappointing before you buy , beware what is the dinnerware made of \? if the dinnerware is not high fire stoneware , porcelain or a china clay body , forget it if you plan to use it then you are wasting your money someone should be ashamed
this item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher , but it is so small that it is useless its only 9 inches tall , so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine , forget it i bought it because i missed the ice in the door of my old fridge , but after trying it several times , i sent it back it is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter i dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it , so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it i takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup , and about 2 cups to fill a glass you need 4 hands to operate it 1 to hold the lid , 1to turn the crank , 1to keep it from bouncing all over the place , and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place \( it slides out and then the ice lands on the base \) then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice , you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass i broke the glass the first time i tried it it hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear , making it even more wobbly but as i said in the begging , it is cute
the furniture itself is fine or rather , it would be if it was shipped properly before ordering anything from target , think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return if you receive something damaged \( and you will \) , be prepared for an extensive return process chances are , the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well this happened to me twice if you 're lucky , you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments this , however , will take time additionally , even if the piece is not cracked , you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood i bought the desk , the hutch and the bookcase all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain
this blender is frustrating it offers good points , but in the end , the flaws outweigh the benefits first the good
i thought it was me but every time that i lift the cover on this oven , there is this strange rotting smell it does n't seem to matter what has been in there , either no matter what food same rotting smell
i 've had my share of dutch ovens in my time , and i have to say that this is the foulest one yet i thought i smelled a good deal when i got it , but boy was i mistaken
i just baked a loaf of banana bread in my loaf baker and the entire bottom stuck to the pan when i turned it over
received the bowls yesterday , and once again very upset to find 3 of the 4 broken this has got to be costing a ton of money in refunds and shipping i will not try again for a replacement , i did n't do well with the sango mixing bowls either ca n't understand why these are shipped with such little packing material
i purchased the robinson pyrex candy thermometer as a replacement for my old , cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings
the only positive thing i can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well other than that , it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 50 marks also , it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates since using this thermometer , i have ruined more batches of fudge than i care to think about if you want a good candy thermometer , do n't buy this one
the pan itself is fine , but it measures closer to 16 in diameter the cooking surface is 12 , but the pan has such a wide lip around it that it does n't come close to fitting in my convection toaster oven
i bought a set of these years ago , and used them almost daily freezer to oven to table , on the range never a problem , and wanted to replace the same sized casserole as the previous reviewer stated , the rough and unfinished bottom of the dish was coarse and gritty , and scratched my table and counter what a disappointment ! i do n't believe the older set i have was made in china , but here in the usa save your money
the cooking set looks great however , once you heat the pot pan , the steel material handles become super hot i have to return the huge box
do n't be fooled by this apparently well designed grater the hinge is weak and will break the grater looks and feels great , but do n't expect it to last
to begin with
absolute rubbish cheap , inferior product , do n't waste your money
i ca n't believe someone uses this pan to cook eggs ! i have tried several cooking oils and butter , and everything sticks to this pan , making it very difficult to clean my husband wo n't even use it
i placed two separate orders for this product and each order was received with one broken dish the set s not packaged correctly by the manufacture ended by buying a different produce else where
i have used this pan 3 times , twice to cook meat it does not brown the meat stick to the pan i made stuffed artichokes last night and even though i used olive oil and water to begin the steaming process , the pan was a mess to clean i have never had any problems with myers anodized pans , 18 10 pans or , of couse , teflon i'm not sure what this pan will be useful for but i believe i will only use it for vegetables or rice
this is a great cutting board if one able to removed all the sticker glue that stays on the cutting board forever
i have always used rubbermaid or tupperware plastic storage , but i replaced all of them with pyrex glass storage containers in may of 2005 i was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when i washed it in the dishwasher also , i liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad
i'm actually having trouble sleeping on these sheets they are so uncomfortable and rough they may be technically 320 tc , but they do not feel like more than 150 ! strongly recommend against buying them mine are going to have a nice life as paint drop cloths
the rating i give this item relates to the lack of value in a few more clicks , you can buy a service for eight of white corelle for less than what three of these dinner plates will cost you that said , i have owned my corelle \( two services for four \) for more than twenty five years , using it regularly all dishes are intact , they are light and stack nicely , and maybe i'm just not enough of a snob but i do n't know why anyone would need any other dishes
after checking the calphalon web site the suggested retail price for model r1384 14 everyday pan is 160 00
this sushi set is really nice unfortunately amazon does n't know how to ship ceramic properly
i purchased this product in a retail store the packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe then after you unpack it , and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty ! do not make the same mistake i did , avoid this product
i have used pyrex bakeware for over 20 years , and i was shocked when my fairly new 9x13 pan shattered i figured i just got unlucky and got a bad one i was going to buy a new one thank goodness i read the reviews first ! and yes , i did follow instructions i baked my lasagne at 350 degrees , did not use an open flame or broiler , etc etc i ca n't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold ! i am so mad ! i am switching to corningware now
well im the newest victim of exploding pyrex last night i was cooking some salmon in my 3 quart pyrex that i 've had for 3 years and used many times before it was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes i pulled it out and set it on the counter well i leaned in to check the salmon and as i pulled away the glass exploded ! not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere thankfully i pulled away when i did because if i had pulled away 2 seconds later i would have had a face full of pyrex shrapnel i came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach and from what i 've heard i was lucky even though my boyfriend and i swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light i could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen im not taking any chances , im throwing out my other pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays please do not use pyrex ! it is not worth the risk ! you may have a few years of good use , but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children \?
i have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex until now last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400f oven , my pyrex dish exploded it rained glass all over the inside of my oven it was a disaster i am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time this sounds like a real problem !
i was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after i figured out how to make it work , loved it after a while the latch on the top broke off and i had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee that made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down it was a little inconvenient but i got use to it then the metal filter broke and i decided to get a new one luckily i put the old one in the garage for spare parts because not long after i started using the new one the side tab broke off and i had to grab a replacement off the old one i will probably not purchase this brand again
if you want to buy this color buy anchor bakeware it is so good
i owned a rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it when it stopped working i therefore bought another \( this one \) from rival i 've used it twice the top does n't seem to keep the liquid in , even on low , and it burned the food both times i do n't trust it now and am not sure whether i 'll try it again
i bought this because it was well priced , good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers i assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that i gave away the first time i used it \( as soon as it got up to tempurature \) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter the lid is the worst ! at first i thought maybe i was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid now i realize this is the way it was designed ! i made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid the only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly , tumbly , bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter not to mention its probably a fire hazard i do n't think my paper towel idea is what rival had in mind when they designed this ! i wish i could return this but i threw away the receipt
the lid does not fit and is not heavy enough to keep it firmly on the pot it allows liquids to escape i think this could be a problem
i have had this for 2years now and what a waste of money it has been i have used this a few of times before i decided to toss them this set was a disaster the parer is dull period and the peeler peels off much more than just the skin , you lose almost 20 \( no exaggeration \) of the fruit or the vegetable
we have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it we now have to borrow a friends hoover steamvac when we need to clean the carpet we are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right it never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection i would n't buy
i really thought i would like this product when i got it out of the box it 's looks well made and looked easy to use i followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer i put the the heat setting on warm as i was not in a hurry and i left the room for about 5 minutes when i came back there was mixture all over my cabinets , counters , etc and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad i later found out that no matter what heat setting i used it would over heat i cannot recommend this product to anyone i'm sorry to say
i 've had to bring this back to hoover 5 times in less than a year
like many others , i bought this because it came highly recommended by consumer reports it worked great for a while , but after about a year the brush stopped spinning i replaced the belt \( twice ! \) but it still wo n't work if i did n't read about so many others having similar problems , i would have guessed that i just got a bad vacuum but after reading other reviews here at amazon , i see that this is not a model that anyone should buy , despite the high rating from consumer reports
the tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd for one or two people , it simply does n't work you must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly i once had a smaller tea press , and i thought that was what i was purchasing here
i have other oxo items that i like very much , but these stainless steel measuring cups are a big disappointment i also experienced the handle bending easily when packing in brown sugar they will be in my next yard sale
i really like oxo products i have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and i enjoy that they have nice big handles since i started getting gadgets for my kitchen i always wanted these measuring cups well i finally got them i was very excited to use them for the first time well i went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending i was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are i think i 'll stick to my plastic ones from oxo , i had better luck with them
usually oxo produces well designed items that have you thinking they really thought about how this thing was going to be used \( and abused \) ! quot unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on very bendy handles it 's a shame , but you should pass on these
i have been making ice cream in a cuisinart machine for years but i wanted to regain my freezer space from the 2 canisters i had to keep ready i also wanted to make good gelato since i ca n't go to italy all the time i had first bought the lussino 4080 by musso it was terrible too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time it did n't get firm , it became a rock i returned it and got the lello gelato pro instead it is quieter , has a washable bowl , costs about half the money , weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1 1 2 quarts there is no contest the lello is the superior machine
i bought this piece of junk at wal mart i was actually surprised to see a food processor so cheap , so i decided to buy it
the old oxo tea kettles had a train whistle sound this new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you could n't hear it in the next room save your money and buy something cheaper it will work as well if not better i returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too
unlike the other reviewers , my kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years it never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me it did n't make cork pulling labor free but i found it much easier than any previous such tool i ever owned alas , as in many of the other reviews , the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable a cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service i just visited the kitchenaid web page and they do n't offer a cork screw for sale anymore i presume that i will soon toss mine as well planning to buy one of these for 30 \? clint would ask you do you feel lucky
like 7 of the 8 other reviews , this product broke with no way to repair it for the price and apparent sturdiness , it is just one big failure and is to be avoided
hoover has a known problem with the belts stretching out on all the self propelled vacuums , but will do nothing for customers stuck with them ! we must replace the drive and propel belts every couple of months rediculous poor customer servic
this torch just does not work i wo n't stay lit for more than a couple of seconds when it does stay lit , the flame is horrible please , for the love of god , do not waste your money on this
i , too , bought this terrible piece of equipment my complaint , aside from the odd taste , consistency and smell , was that you could not tell when the egg was done it was still raw at 10 minutes by the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball what a waste of money as far as thinking up other purposes for it , i suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something you 'll have to think of something , just do n't put eggs in it
its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage so how did they manage to mess this one up \? the flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder , so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place , the collar can not screw on all the way the result \? a build up of meat in the front part of the collar this eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment how hard would it have been for kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight \?
disappointed with the size of product , have not used it yet
i have ordered and returned twice and my third one they sent has the same result
i purchased this handsome can opener in june 2004 feels looks substantial and promising it worked ok for a couple of months , and now it 's useless i 'll return to using my zyliss opener , and throw this in the trash
to be fair , the design is great looking , size is ideal , and very functional however , beware of quality and packaging whoever packaged this in thailand did not take care , it has nicks and scratches everywhere not to mention the dings in corners paint in all the panels is inconsistent therefore , you can see different colorations throughout different panels it is somewhat redish in stain tone , could be darker to be a true dark walnut manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes , which makes it tough when assembling got screws , just missing screw holes i only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman , not for the average person recommend you need the following tools drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits \( just in case \) , small bottle of dark wood stain \( to touch up painting the scratches \) , and some patience
i was so excited to receive my delonghi caffe sorrento bar4 4 cup espresso cappuccino machine
my screwpull lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1 year locked up and when i pulled a little harder it stripped a gear \( the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic \)
my husband sweats a lot at night and i thought this would stop the problem it did n't at all it does n't seems like it does anything for me either it just feels like a normal mattress pad not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad
regardless of the setting you use , you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds in addition , the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top does not work be prepared to grind more than you need , and then measure the grounds \( somehow avoiding the powder \) yourself
in my case i ca n't even say it 's noisy because the grinder did n't work at all ! manufacturing defect deprived me the chance to listen how it works
i bought this thinking i would be able to regulate the size , \( i have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr still works \) , to say it is loud is an understatement , 1st thing in the am i had it about 2 weeks , when i noticed it was hot to the touch , and it no longer worked , mind you i had not used it in 2 days , and had moved it to clean i have not contacted them at this point , but do not want a replacement , and a part of me is glad it broke , so i do n't have to listen to the noise anymore
i ordered the my cafe from amazon in early october and received it a few days later on initial set up , the unit failed to prime i talked to bunn 's service dept and was coached to try several steps , which did not work i was given a return authorization number and told that i would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one i have fed ex verification that the my cafe was received by bunn on october 18 i called bunn on november 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes no return call came i called again on november 9th and was told that the my cafe has been on back order and that i am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment they could not , or would not , give me any meaningful information on when i might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original my cafe may be a great machine but bunn 's service is atrocious
i got the machine yesterday and was so excited i got it all ready to prime by following the directions , and it did n't work after several attempts i called bunn customer service thinking that i must be doing something wrong when i talked to the customer service rep he told me that the machine was n't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine i'm thinking for 200 00 this is n't right , and why has n't the company fixed it \? he was very nonchalant about it as if it did n't matter just get a new one this just is n't acceptable to me there are many positive reviews so i'm sure if you get a working one than you 'll probably be happy with it as for me , i refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company is n't even trying to remedy therefore , i'm sending it back to amazon for a full refund and buying the simple human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews
the frother is great ! easy to use etc the espresso temperature is 140 degrees f when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes at that low temperature you ca n't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate this occurs when the grind is too fine i 've had this machine for over a year and it is not recommended i use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine to add insult to injury , the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap i thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble previously i had a gaggia which is superior in every manner , and cheaper also the only reason i rated it 2 stars is because of the frother
i bought the capresso 114 last december \( the difference being , the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir \) this machine is unbelievably finicky you must use an extremely coarse grind \( according to the manual \) , and almost zero tamping pressure \( again , according to the manual \) , otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow \( several minutes for a shot of espresso \) even when you get everything according to instructions \( which includes , according to capresso tech support , disassembling the machine every few days \) , it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso , which comes out weak , bitter , and with no crema after two months of discussing this with capresso tech support and getting nowhere , i returned the machine to amazon after that i bought a krups xp 4000 bliss ! the machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds , even with a fine grind and firm tamp
this machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned european style coffee drinker \( coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean , not a tall cup of sanka as the term is used in the us \) admittedly , i'm really picky about my coffee , but 250 for this machine is ridiculous i 've had coffee from a 40 krups machine that is better than that made by the espressopro i use high quality pods with this machine \( molinari , lucaffe , and miscela d'oro \) which guarantees consistency in other machines , but does n't help with this machine here are my issues with the machine
inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays , one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device after only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked after about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked i would not recommend this product to anyone
this worked great for 5 minutes i tried everything to make it work again over three days i finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do send it to them and they will replace it i'm glad they were responsive , but now i have to pay to ship the darn thing to michingan
i too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit , and mind you , you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer i have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail i would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason
as another reviewer experienced , our krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often , which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter , and which place i have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance carafe positioning appears to be the problem , because it does n't leak every time maybe my unit is defective , because other reviewers do n't mention this , and believe me , you would notice this if it were occurring with yours
i had slightly older edition of the krups crystal aroma for several years , until i lost one carafe too many if you 're careless , when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop but that 's my fault the crystal aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water , but overall , the quality of the coffee it produces is merely ok
i ordered the pro 5 plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times they kept sending the commercial 5 mixer in the meantime i have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods i have ordered many cookie art books , along with many supplies as well as the set of 3 pasta maker attachment for this mixer this has been going on since the beginning of december but no mixer !
i ordered these glasses 3 times and everytime they came in a million pieces i would not waste your time purchasing these
my first cuisinart 4 slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3 month warantee period it started heating when not turned on , and made strange clicking sounds it never had toasted very well , and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting to their great credit , cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone \( although it took 3 months \) the replacement toaster also toasts very lightly , very slowly , but at least it 's not an immediate fire hazard
i saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too i took my chances and ordered one anyway
this sifter broke a month after i got it it seems sturdy but it actually requires carefull handling the sifting is somewhat slow but good \( excercise ! ! ! \)
the amco sifter broke during the second time i was using it and the first time i used it it took a long time and the handle kept sticking also my hand , wrist and arm were hurting so bad from all the work it took just to get four cups sifted it also leaks flour where the handle is at the bottom
this item is too big and very difficult to operate it is the worst breville product purchased the panni press does the same thing without the difficult cleaning i would not recommend this item too much money definately not worth the cost
brass rivets expand and contract wood expands and contracts together these elements are a bad concept from the word go , because they will ultimately separate because someone will at one time or another put them in the dishwasher the metal is only tempered 4 times leaving the metal soft , meaning there is a lot of sharpeing to do henckel , cutco , trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times \( the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle \)
i purchased this blanket because i loved the color that is the only thing it has going for it there were feathers all over the place and i keep finding random ones in rooms on different floors ! it is now stored in an airtight bag because i ca n't toss it i paid good money for it
be aware , if you are looking for bonechina stay away from this piece it is made in china and very low qualit
i had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews i wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs not heavy cleaning but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup \( rescued mother cat and 4 kittens \) it does a good job for lint and hair but does n't work on kitty litter it spits it around or keeps in roller section i thought i was using it wrong and tried it every way but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it 's turned off i'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum
i received the 14 4 volt vacuum for christmas 2004 after a full charge , it lasts less than a minute it would be great if the battery lasted , but it does n't go with another product and save your money on this piece of junk
i bought this product about a year ago and for a while it worked great then i noticed that the unit was starting to shut off faster and faster until today when i finally decieded to toss her overall in the beginning yes there is alot of power but what is the good of it when the battery 's life is only about a year before she goes i wouldnt recommend one especially since dirt devil came out with a cyclone one which i will try with hopefully longer lasting results
first of all i was abt to buy this product but cancled my purchase as i found the same kind toaster with less price in the market
easily the worst toaster ever brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked there are just not enough words in the english language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc etc well , maybe not useless , if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet i 'd give it a minus 5 stars , but they do not even have a 0 star vote
this grinder grinds well but failed after just 2 months of operation do n't buy it unless you want to waste your money
this pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread for the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster i have ever owned it is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread save your money do not buy this product
stop be for you buy ! ! ! ! should have saved my money making pasta with this machine is disappointing the recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder i redid the dough 3 times before i was able to extrude it , and still it stuck together i should have listened to the rest of the reviews , but having owned a pasta maker extruder before i thought it would be a piece of cake if i were you i would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer on the bright side though the food grinder is wonderful
i have not tried this pasta attachment a second time i'm afraid of harming the motor the mixer became very hot and oil even leaked out i going to get the mixer checked serviced and not risk damage again one thing missing from these reviews is the mixer models used perhaps those with the heavier motors work better \? i have the smaller motor \( 250 w \) k45ss mixer surely kitcheaid must read these reviews i would expect some additional user information for this product on their website , but see nothing very disappointing product and consumer support come on kitchenaid give more info and or offer to give credit for return of this questionable product
the only 2 foods it grates well are parmesan and chocolate , as long as the chocolate is cold , not worth the money , i think i 'd rather use my small hand held gater it was a good try , but i wo n't buy another one
i 've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it 's other plastic siblings it too broke within 2 days of use these plastic graters just are n't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses , or by someone who has a strong grip the common defect i'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum the tiny amount of plastic there is n't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum
the first dolce item i purchased was the wine tower and i have been very happy with that piece however , the coffee table and end tables all arrived with cracks the coffee table was not glued together properly and was misaligned not pleased at all and way too costly to ship back
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my mother i was very excited when it arrived much sooner than i had anticipated i opened it up , so that i could give it to my mom assembled unfortunately , an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering the packing materials are insufficient to say the least i immediately called target 's customer service , and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table despite my dissapointment about the broken table i was glad that target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle 60 br 62
it looked like a great idea , just what i needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep problem is , there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design there is a finger crush area near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it i have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time i used it if i ca n't make it safe with a saw , then out it goes it 's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use
i splurged on this pan because i was tired of the wobble my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop this pan warped severely after only 4 months , not any better than pans a fraction of the cost i plan on returning it for replacement , and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only
i had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great i am not sure what is wrong with this type we had it for a whole week then it stopped working do yourself a favor and do not get this
when i bought my first littermaid box , i thought it was a miracle no more scooping ! hooray ! it worked so well for my four cats that a few months later , i bought a second one unfortunately , the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks \( and i 'd thrown the receipt away , so i could n't get my money back \) soon after that , the original box quit working , too so , within about 6 months , i spent close to 200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned
the littermaid mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases i have ever made in less than two months time , the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely litter maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat well , i have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily the litter maid is good for controlling odors when it works , but it constantly jammed and then shut down \( and i used a recommended brand of premium cat litter \) after a few weeks of this load , the tiny \( and very loud \) motor simply gave up i'm waiting to hear from litter maid regarding warranty repair replacement , but i suspect i 'll end up returning to a traditional 5 00 litter tray the overall concept of the litter maid is good , but without sturdier components , it ends up being trash in no time
i very much enjoyed this unit when it was new it did everything that was stated on the box however , i now need to replace the ifd filter due to the accumulation of nicotene on it and can not find one anywhere i purchased two units at once for around 450 00 if i had used them in a dust atmosphere they would still be great ! honeywell should have tested on nicotene and smoke odors before touting the phrase permanent in reference to smoke and nicotene i am sadly disappointed in a company , who over the years , i have purchased many of their products
the machine is easy to use and makes great espresso when it 's working ! mine broke down within the first year i spent 80 dollars to fix it the first time , but it broke down again after another two months of use \( water would n't heat up \) it would cost me another 200 to fix it i'm now looking for a more reliable machine
we have nothing but henckels in our kitchen , as we love to cook , and everyone who cooks knows the value of good knives
a little less than so so you think it is a bargain because of the name it 's not get some good steak knives at your grocer 's
i have had this kit for 3 1 2 months and still no seeds have sprouted the package does say it may take a few months though you might consider getting a starter kit set instead with potted plants
i bought both this and the similar version from brookstone this year i was expecting a lot from the metrokane , but it turns out the brookstone is much better it 's 60 , but the brookstone version will last you much longer than the 45 metrokane
my salter 1001 scale started having problems within 3 months and broke within 10 months i am sending the scale back to saltier for replacement a good scale while it worked , but what pain this has become
the thread count softness of the sheets met my expectations , however the top sheet was the wrong size , it did not even fit across my queen size bed i had to return them
i 've owned black and decker 's predecessor to this unit the shortcut for about 25 years it was a well designed mini food processor so i had high hopes for the black decker mfp200 minipro plus food processor what a disappointment !
i bought one of these to make bagna cauda , and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the high button , it sparked and died well , ok , i guess it only half died , as the pulse button would still work , if i leaned on it with my entire weight , but both the high and low switch settings did nothing so i'm thinking next time i 'll spend a little more meanwhile , this little guy goes back
i only used mine once , then tossed it wish i would have read these reviews first ! thought it looked good at kohls i liked that the grates can be seperated to wash they do , but it takes a lot of force feels like you 're going to break them i should have returned it but i was mad at it and trashed it at least it was marked 15 off \( still higher than here though \)
really nice bowl with cover it mushed up the tomatoes and the safety handle you hold on to broke on the second use it does however make very thin slices
great while it worked , though a little large but , it broke after 4 5 month
too slow to give reading almost never changes
i have purchased these plates from amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in england so , i ordered more to go along with my current set to find that now they are made in india and were not of the same quality as those made in england i sent them back i will say that had i not already had the more detailed colorful items , i might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than i did
i was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and i needed to send it back for a refund
cthis is my second bread maker i bought cuisinart 's one last year and had used it for about a year i had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point
i was so looking forward to this machine i am a long time machine bread maker and have had two other brands with not a problem first , yes it burns the crust on med second , i made 4 , count them , four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were all awful could not believe it each time i followed the reciped and instructions to the letter
i bought this rack thinking that i can now bake cakes with bigger size , or cool a bunch of cookies on the same rack well i am very disappointed but let 's start witht he good things first
i had to wash the comforter 3 times before it softened up enough for me to put it on my son 's bed
this is a gorgeous ice bucket it is large and stylish however , i cannot recommend it because of the lid the lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off instead , it pivots and swings up the problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing and , because the lid is not removable , it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne wine cooler poor design flaw i want an ice bucket that i can remove the lid and put it aside if i do n't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way you 'll notice in oxo 's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up why \? because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way hey oxo , that 's the same look i wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar !
i picked one of these up for my husband for father 's day it looked like a great idea , avoiding the mess of ice and rock salt we followed the directions exactly and were very disappointed when chocolate soup emerged from the maker we put it in a container in the freezer and ended up with a chocolate brick ! needless to say , we are not at all happy with this product
i have a profesional 6 model , and i did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta it did n't kill the mixer , but the motor became very hot ! i will never use it again i also have the roto slicer shredder , fruit veggie strainer , food grinder sausage stuffer attachments none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm that tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product i am thankful that my model is 525 watts i could only imagine what would have happened if i had a classic 300 watt model !
have been wanting to get the pasta roller attachment and ran accross this plastic pasta maker at the store was really excited since it was in my price range took it home and tried to use it my kitchenaid mixer starting smoking and so i let it rest for the hour upon removing the attachment i found oil and black rubber or grease was all over the inside of the attachment \( on the coil thing that pushes the dough through \) next time i wanted to use my mixer to beat egg whites it had no power i sure hope this inexpensive attachment did n't ruin my wonderful mixer highly disappointed with kitchenaid on this attachment
if you buy this this thing , be prepared to cut off about an inch off the tip , 'cause apparently the tip is just there for aesthetics plunging this thermometer into boiling water , it wo n't read accurately \( 15 20deg under \) until at least an inch of the tip is immersed
very annoying that you ca n't get the filters for this coffee maker anywhere
the bag is narrow and difficult to fill you invariably end up with a mess which gets even more messy because the bag is made from a very slippery plastic i had no luck using this bag , even though i gave it two chances
i purchased a 14 cup cuisinart some years ago i have had nothing but trouble first the handle stuck while i was kneading dough and i barely was able to pry it off then i had problems with the stem when i tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested i buy a new cuisinart ! stay away from cuisinart ! i'm looking into kitchen aid for my new processor
i recently purchased this product the first time i used it , i thought it worked great i made a pot of chili and let it cook until we were ready to eat it that night the second time i used it , things were not as good the outer shell where the controls are were literally melting i had programmed this to cook for 10 hours while i went to work i came home that night and the hours had not changed i realized i did n't click the on off button to start heating the cooker this may have saved a house fire i went ahead and changed the time from 10 to 4 hours this set the unit to high instead of the original low setting not 15 minutes after turning on , the outer covering was melting i immediately shut it off i see the 4 quart units were recalled back in 2004 for similar issues whatever their problem , it has not been fixed be aware of this serious problem when using your slow cooker i am returning mine and will exchange for a different brand
bought this for the kitchen and the only piece that truly does what it is supposed to do is the vase they give to hold all the pieces the spoons both melted in pots of boiling water stirring spaghetti the spatula bent and distorted while trying to lift something off a hot cookie sheet
stainless my foot ! i received these from my wedding registry and only just used them for thanksgiving this weekend after one run through the dishwasher , several pieces are rusted , the finish has worn off , and they are even pock marked in places ! i too threw away the box when i first took them out , and cannot find any information on warranty or how to contact cambridge silversmiths
these sheets are like 200 cotton count not 1200 cotton count do not order you will be sorry ! !
these silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored , easy to wash in the dishwasher , and protective even when wet they are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery , the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen they are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot , but not for picking the hot pot up
i just received my set the glasses are so beautiful ! yet , 5 out of 6 are defective ! ! what a big disappointment ! i have been looking forward to receiving my first riedel amazon com provides great deal which i got 80 for 6 glasses , but they were obviously factory seconds ! so disappointed ! however , the design of the glass are beautiful ! ! i am still returning them ! so sad !
great sugar dish , fantastic colour , but amazon 's shipping time of 1 2 weeks is way off i ordered this twice and had it take well over a month to arrive
amazon seems to experience a disproportionate number of pricing errors whenever you attempt to purchase anything at amazon that represents a 50 or higher discount , do n't expect to receive it poor business practices
this is our second george f grill the first one burned out after about 5 years we liked but could not get the same size so we got this one it was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices what a mistake ! ! ! ! after less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat \( spade conn \) just fell apart being the handy man that i am , i fixed it today \( 9 6 2005 \) it burned out again this grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled it is a piece of junk we will replace it with a different brand thanks for nothing george
i would n't purchase anything from vision decour ! i ordered this 3 piece set the same say i ordered pieces from three other companies it took vision decour longer to just e mail me than it did the other companies to ship and deliver the other three pieces i ordered apparently the set i ordered was out of stock , but vision decour neglected to update their web site after they contacted me about this issue i checked their site and they still had the set listed as availabel and in stock so now i have been waiting for weeks and have half of a living room with no prospect of getting the table set i needed to match everything else
these bowls are wonderful a great addition to my winterberry collection , however they came packaged in the same packaging as they would in store , so during shipment they were broken amazon was great to send replacements , but some of those were broken too i have finally received all dishes i ordered , but beware of receiving broken dishes
my first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings i have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven the statement on the inside instructions when cooking in a barbecue or smoker , do not use as a continuous read thermometer , use only as an instant read thermometer , 5 do not use this unit to measure cooking temperatures over 392 9702 f as well as warranty excludes thermometer probes should be on the outside , letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk if you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours , a cheap 6 00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86 9702 to 572 9702 if you can only use to 392 9702 i would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit 's instructions , but 275 9702 in the oven killed mine so maybe not \? cut to the chase , look for a better unit and let me know when you find it
i 've had 2 polder thermometers and both of them have had a very short life span do n't waste your money
this unit looks like it would be fun for the kids , but in fact , it barely works even when the insert is pre frozen in a zero degree freezer , the maching has problems getting the mix even into a soft state , and even when it gets close to that , the ice cream does not dispense in a manner that allows for the classic soft serve look in the cone an email to cuisinart regarding the problem went unanswered we used it twice , and gave up one hint that 's not in the instructions you have to keep the machine running while dispensing or trying to dispense the ice cream another hint that 's not in the instructions do n't buy this item
the machine leaked after we poured in the liquid ingredients the mix in dispenser did not operate properly , all we put in were sprinkles the ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes kids cannot wait that long we could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time save your money , buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time
your freezer needs to at least zero degrees f in order to have the bowl freeze to a point the ice cream comes out a consistency thicker than a very thin milk shake i needed a seperate chest freezer in order to achieve these temps
this cooker made great rice for a grand total of 3 uses before it broke ! it also has a very thin and easily dented aluminum bowl that is not non stick there are better cookers out there for comparable prices do n't waste your money
that 's right i got taken twice i bought this cooker for under 20 a few years ago , and it died after the second use considering it was so inexpensive , i just bought another one it died again after only one use i wish i would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem i guess salton just recycle their returns so they can afford to pay george foreman the 90 million they owe him for endorsements
i received this a shower gift a few years ago standard mixer , ca n't do anything too drastic with it , but i noticed the last time i took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted these are not stainless beaters and they will rust i'm in the market for a new mixer
this is clearly a case of you get what you pay for for easy jobs this mixer works fine , but give it a thick batch of brownie mix or cookie dough and the motor will just di
i 've had this toaster for four years now it just started going down hill recently
do n't bother buying the pots after only 2 months use , the inside edges are cracking off \( i hand wash all the pots \) i have a fry pan of another brand that i have used for over 3 years and this never happened in addition , in spite of purchasing the 12 piece set and three additional pans , they refused to give me a 20 00 promised rebate i'm ready to junk the set
while these are pretty feel good in your hand , they rust i had them for 3 days when several of the forks began forming rust inside the swirly patterns
you look at them in a picture frame the fish are crammed in there
ok this is the stupidest thing i read all the reviews and all the nagitvive ones i agree with i wouldnt put a guggy just one guppy in the i have african cichlids mbunas to be exact and i have a 29gallon i over stocked mine but i dont carei have 15 if you count the two plecos ok i have a 60 gallon filter does this thing have a filter \? \? \? and if its only 6 34 gallons or 2 16 gallons idk its not worght it if you want a small fish tank get a desktop or if you want a wall fish tank get a custom they only cost 1 , 000 dollars spend it its worth it byebye and thank
i was excited when i got the set , however after a few cuts uses the knives are dull and the santoku has rust on the sharp end of the blade for a warranty claim i have to pre pay postage to get a replacement not recommended at all ! i'm surprised at the low quality with this brand
we own a set of 2 man pro series and this set did not even compare returned them the same day they arrived to my house
i have a set of mid range henckels that i bought some years ago , and they are much better than this i bought this set for my daughter because they were a good compromise between quality and price , and she wo n't ruin then in the dishwasher i would have thought that henckels would n't make any actual crap , but this set comes awfully close the good thing is , boy are they sharp but there 's bad things too only the 8 chef 's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all , the rest are very thin and flimsy 'laser cut' edges are overrated make them another millimeter thick please , so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction a good knife is an extension of the cook 's intention it does what you want , and does not require thought and pre conception and compensation in every cut \( \) is waaay too much for one adequate chef 's knife and some toys very disappointed in henckels , and in amazon too , i do n't feel i got what i ordered
we got this as a wedding gift and it worked ok for about 2 years , but there are 2 plastic parts that have broken in the last month making it unusable would not recommend this machine or this brand to anyon
i myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot , i will agree with other reviewers , this delonghi is dewrongi my husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre heat the carafe before brewing if he does n't get a chance to drink it right away , he puts the carafe \( filled with coffee \) onto the stovetop on low well a couple mornings ago , we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work without thinking , he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat next thing i know i'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading he dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah , no damage was done \( we are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months
i went to amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems yes , delonghi makes a great product no , this is not one of them i have read the directions so often i have them memorized , and i can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit i bought mine from costco , and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for costco product runs i hope that is not the problem , but that is all i can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews so who else bought this unit from costco \? because if that is the problem i 'll bet costco will be all over delonghi to fix it until then , this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning , every day
these knives barely cut and the title is misleading this set has nothing to do with faberware also , i have had this set for only a few weeks and already rust has appearred on them buy them if you intend it for one time use
these are not farberware , but hoan which makes cut rate kitchen implements like knives , measuring cups etc i sent these as a gift , and was hugely embarrassed when i showed up for dinner and found out i 'd sent this junk this is deceptive advertising at its worst shame on you , amazon !
my mom bought me this set for my anniversary two years ago we use it regularly and run it through the dishwasher and it is just horrible looking it spots and marks pitifully i ca n't get most of the spots off no matter what i do i wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if i mailed it in , but with the weight of the set \( because it really is a heavy duty set of flatware \) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all i would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time so , i am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision
used this burner during a kitchen renovation does n't heat very evenly for use with a skillet , but product is sufficient for boiling water for pasta and vegetables wish the base was heavier for stability
hi , i usually do n't complain about the products that i buy because i consider myself a savvy consumer , but in this instance i was dubbed big time ! a few years ago , we received a krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it ! however , this particular toaster rarely worked in fact , i would say that 85 time it would either not toast or would flip the toast prematurely e g 5 second or less i have no idea if this is a fluck in quality control or not , but i highly recommend buying a different toaster i know , i thought , krups makes a toaster \? wow , i 'll buy it , after all how hard can it be for a german company to manufacture functional a toaster \? well , evidently , they have issues
although consumer reports rated this model as 2 , i have found this a very disappointing purchase the cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster it toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently i am very sorry i purchased this toaster i was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but i 've learned that consumer reports does not always get everything right listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster as soon as i find another toaster , this one goes off to goodwill
nice , shiny , new , heavy , quality product
i 've had this appliance since just before thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice
i have had this gadget for a little over a year as we got it as a wedding gift i had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when i could use a manual grater right when i needed it last week , i needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe i read the instructions front to back , allowed it to charge the full amount of time , and i was pretty excited when it came time to try it out right from the start , i knew it was junk you are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade not mine the plastic piece kept coming off , and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures i decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability once i started trying to grate , i had a really hard time getting the thing to shred i tried varying degrees of pressure as others commented , the cheese does get stuck everywhere then , the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds i did not get the nice big shreds that i am used to with my manual grater my husband thought i was doing it wrong , so he tried it he had the same result i will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill , because people are better off without it since it was a gift , i'm glad i'm not out any money it is going in the trash
i wish i saw the feedback before i bought this this thing sucks you have to charge it 15hours just to get 23minutes of nothing it has no power and it just pushes the cheese it doesnt even grade it please dont waste your mone
to whom it may concern cheap assembly , binds up on internal hardwear , does not press fully , all in all , very poor product you would be better off hand squeezing with you hand than you would with this item run
after a couple of years of casual use , my bowl also cracked in the freezer fortunately i had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum now i'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl
i received this as a gift for christmas it worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times but then , the base burst in my freezer , spewing foul scented goo all over i contacted the manufacturer to ask how to get it replaced , and never heard back apparently they do n't care about backing up their product now i have to buy another one , and it wo n't be this brand
i bought this item on sale at shopko , where it will be returned today i froze the gel disk as instructed , bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream , cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed after 45 minutes of mixing i ended up with ice cream soup you could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat i put it in a container in the freezer the next morning i had an ice cream brick not to be deterred i microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop this stuff gets harder than cement ! after all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic like aftertaste i had to throw it all out
i used this maybe a dozen times before i stopped using it out of disgust the surface is fragile and hard to clean i reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care i did a bone in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer what 's the point if you ca n't clean it or let anything harder than jell o come into contact with it
well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking the copper does , indeed , boil water fast and that 's the job of a kettle , i admit however , the button trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you 're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle as you tilt the kettle to pour , you 're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers it 's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst
why would anyone rate these glasses more than 1 star if amazon is refusing to credit for those broken in shipment
the handles , although very cushioned , are too fat for my hands \( which admittedly are rather small \) i never really got to give either piece a true test though , because the blades on the parer and the vegetable peeler were way too dull to work well i ca n't really recommend either , although the parer was a little better than the peeler
this bowl does not work with the ice 45 ice machin
i'm sure that this is a wonderful can opener if you can figure out how to use it i recieved mine as a gift , and neither the giver , myself , or my husband can figure out how to use the thing i was told that the instructions could be copied from the internet , but who can find them
i bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust well , sure enough , rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher the rust spots were small , but i returned the set anyways , as i am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others
this delonghi toaster oven was not made as well as the previous one we had the grey plastic on the sides made it look cheap the stainless steel was very thin too you could bend it easily
i was pretty happy with this toaster oven until last night when it just stopped working while i was baking some potatoes i have no idea why it would just quit working like that i am not happy at all with this product
this was a great toaster , until it starting turning itself on after popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on kitchenaid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model , yet
it spins on the counter and the juice always slips out of the cup ! do not buy this piece of junk ! ! ! ! ! do n't waste your money on this
i bought this juicer last week from a local store it is impossible to keep it steady when you use it you are lucky if you get the half of the juice in the glass ! the juice is all over the place the unit started to make a loud noise after 2 days i will return it this weekend and get my money back stay away !
i needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch i had read other reviews of the bissell little green machine that were unfavourable , so headed off to the store to find something else the atlantis express looked interesting , and i had n't seen it before
the first , and only time , i tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster while removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture , the delivery men stained the new carpet i whipped out our new atlantis , filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge with manual in hand , i tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs the unit did not dispense soapy water , the hand held wand leaked , and finally i discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet , creating a soggy new stain so here i am with two stains on my now very wet carpet , furniture being delivered and an atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until i can find a large sledge hammer do n't waste your money with this thing there has to be a better answer
wish i had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before i purchased this i went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 15 years after it got the new plastic taste out of it , it made good coffee even without the brita filter just like all the reviewers indicated , the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully unfortunately , it has quit working after only 2 1 2 months the seller , etronics , is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period that will be the last thing i buy through them like uhh , since they sell braun , one would think they would have some recourse through braun and try to help their customers so , here i am between the proverbial rock and a hard place , try to find a braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced , or just bite the bullet an go buy another \( want to bet it wo n't be a braun \? \) additionally , what do we do for coffee in the mean time \? such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet
i 've had two of these now , and they both had one serious flaw the trumpeted brew and pause feature does not work pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it were n't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up
i loved this coffeemaker , until it just suddenly stopped working and it is n't even 1 year old ! ! previous coffeemakers i owned have lasted years and years i expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over now i have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle i am not a happy customer
i returned this the day it arrived i heated the obligatory 4 cups of water as per instructions left the room and came back in 20 minutes the warning light was not lit i moved the crock to the side to see if i had not properly plugged it in since the light was out i brushed my hand against the exterior lip and received a first degree burn farberwear company customer service said the light is a little dim but you should be able to see it yes , you can see it if you look up from below the crockpot you will see a faint glow the crock pot sits very loosely in its container leaving a large gap between the food container and the heater housing heat escapes through these gaps which accounts for the overheated exterior i would advise those with kids , especially , to find another slow cooker
i received my taylor professional and it appeared to be behaving normally except it shut itself off after 4 to 7 minutes even while its readings were changing now , it is supposed to save its battery life by shutting off if there is no change in its temperature reading for 10 minutes , but it should stay on if its readings are changing the temperatures were no where near the extremes of the thermometer 's range , so this was n't a case of shutting down because of that i e mailed the manufacturer about the problem and was told i could return it to them for replacement i did this and less than three weeks later received a new one from them surprise , surprise this one behaved the same way , shutting off after 4 or 5 minutes even while its readings were changing i e mailed taylor again about this and suggested they check out their existing supply of this model , as i suspected they had many that were shutting down like this approximately two weeks later i received another package from them containing one of their model 9845 thermometers , a different model ! i received no communications from taylor about this , other than their original e mail stating i could return my original thermometer to them for replacement i do n't know what i 'll do now i would like a properly functioning 9878
i own this pan and the bavarian and chrysanthemum models too i think nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing after a few uses , everytime i bake with these pans the cake always stick i grease and flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks one reviewer said to liberally grease these pans , but i do n't understand why there 's so much work for greasing a non stick pan i had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no non stick
i purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it 's too cold to be outside it looks very nice and clean up is super easy the problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it
i finally just threw them out they were apparently cured with some chemical and the smell was terrible
there are only two mixers on the shaft as a result it is very difficult to mix the ice cream into a thick milk shake
we had registered for all clad pans for our wedding last year , and decided to go with a calphalon commercial nonstick set instead the person helping us highly recommended the calphalon one infused anodized set instead , and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic we bought that set and have had it for nearly a year we hardly ever use it , however , because things stick so badly , even with oil while the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and bar keeper 's friend , i'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it
at first we loved this pan we 've used it quite a bit , but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated i can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven i 've contacted all clad and am waiting to see what they say needless to say , i would have been much happier with a less expensive pan i am very happy with all the other all clad pans that we have , but this one is a disappointment
this item is the black sheep of the all clad line it is not a triply pan like other all clad products and is made entirely of stainless steel \( no aluminum \) it is also made in korea where other all clad products are made in the usa
i liked the look of these pots i bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta , potatoes etc the stainless steel used is very poor quality
i bought this coffee maker , because some people gave it high recommendation here i think i wasted my money
i have to agree with the other negative reviews this insert loosely fits the all clad 3 quart casserole pan i bought with it \( which i could understand if i were trying to use it with another brand \) it being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked as with all all clad products it 's built very well but who cares about that if it does n't work properly someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert , it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well i think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam was n't rolling out from in between the insert and pan it works , just not very well
we 're a small restaurant \( 16 seats \) , serving dinner 4 nights a week , and we use the blender for soups , caesar dressing , etc , once or twice a week , but never use ice in it or anything like that we 've had two of this same model now , and had the same problem with both of them the black collar , the part of the base where you set the container , is plastic , and on both blenders has broken the first time it lasted almost a year , and we figured that was n't too bad especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial professional blender , which are 300 also , we really like the blender in terms of function , so we picked up another one this time , the exact same thing happene , except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks ! !
no postives to report
unfortunately , i 've ordered more than my share of foodsaver products , having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage , despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers
i was disappointed in this product the butter slid out of the bell and into the water i think it would be better if the inside of the bell was n't glazed
i bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle this implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design
this percolater makes great coffee and i was very happy with it until it broke within two years actually the first thing that broke was the little plastic knob on the top i called the company and they were very nice about it they quickly sent me a replacement part i thought , what a great company then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after i bought it i called them again they explained that it was no longer under warranty \( i think i missed the warranty term by a month or two \) they offered that i could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original \( i paid about 70 00 , a refurbished one was , i think , 35 00 \) but it came with no warranty and i 'd have to pay shipping i was very , very disappointed thankfully , i had my old drip coffee maker in the attic i pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did
first the plastic top broke off at 6 months then it stopped working at 9
less than one month after puchasing this pasta machine all of the pasta dies have broken the ring nuts cannot hold the dies in place and they break maybe it is because i was making semolina pasta , but that should not be the case this machine has caused me way too much stress at dinner time knowing what i know now i would buy fresh pasta at the store
after my ronco machine broke , i bought this one it never worked well for hollow pasta , and the bearings went out after about 20 uses
i bought this on 8 4 06 when i first got the coffee maker , i ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out afterwards , the machine still smelled like plastic , now i 've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help the horrible plastic smell is still there baking soda is no use also the only thing i 've not used is bleach if you do n't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems
these are plastic y , one cracked after 2nd washing , they look like the little fish bowls from the county fair , so big you have to use 2 hands to prevent sloshing it all over yourself
this was the best toaster over i ever owned but one of the infrared bulbs blew after about 4 months does anyone know where to buy a replacement
i can not testify as to how well this unit makes toast i basically bought this toaster oven for it oven capabilities
the sango splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous , no doubt about it it 's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand so what 's the problem \? it chips i 've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years at last count , there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup that does n't say much for the set 's longevity , especially since i do n't use these every day
this machine does not make clear ice , just like your in refrigerator does not make clear ice
what i most like about this product is the crumb catcher feature unfortunately , i have a problem with the acrylic piece at the end of the cutting board popping out when i am using it i would also recommend that the wood used be a harder wood such as is used normally with cutting boards as when i slice it leaves grooves in the wood
i agree with other writers this unit is very poorly designed and built cutting my third loaf of bread , the knife point came out of the guide , and on return , snaped one of the guides off not washable , end plate falls off while cutting all the time , unit slides over the counter when trying to cut \( rubber feet would have cured this \) i would look elsewhere before buying this unit
very disappointed in this product it falls apart everytime you try to slice a piece of bread the wooden crumb box gouges very easily as well just a piece of flimsy plastic \( i ended up buying a much less expensive bread keepr that came with a slicing guide , about half the price and it works great
the 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor the mirror finish does n't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water the bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd when 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds i did n't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set finding everything that i needed and used was more important the set does heat evenly and cook well it 's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore this product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an islan
i grew up with corelle my mom still has a complete set she got before i was born it survived four kids all boys and three marriages i thought it was indestructible
i like the calphalon contemporary line a great deal , and so i was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan but my first attempt to use it was a failure the small steamer holes \( and not very many of them \) are easily covered by the food to be steamed , leaving the insert to function like a double boiler after working for close to an hour to steam summer squash \( which should take 20 minutes at most \) , i gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it i'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan , but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem
this steamer was only useful to get the wrinkles out of clothes that had been really balled up it gets them to a state where you can iron them more easily , but basically saturates with the steam so the fabric is damp sure there is technique to learn , but i spent a good long time on several different items it heats up quick and produces steam well etc , but it performed far below what i thought were reasonable expectations it also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output i returned it , amazon was good about that , and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place
sigh was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's warning doh ! oh well live and learn live and learn refund , please
how durable can a pan be that arrives in pieces inside the box \? i ca n't imagine breaking my old cast iron frying pan this one had a huge chunk out of the side i sent it back and will look for a better quality item shame on mario for endorsing this thing
with 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right \? nope , i am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly , and i do mean stuck ! i have not had this blender for very long , and i really do n't use it very often either so there is no reason i should be told my blades are probably dull its not like i was making a brick smoothie ! ahh also why does the lid stain so easily i have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color ! the best thing i can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put , and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands i have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems ! looks the mixer is the only thing kitchenaid has perfected
after going thru several 20 dollar blenders in the last 10 years i decided to splurg and go for the kitchenaid well it did n't last even as long as the cheap ones the motor is still good , and the blades are still good , but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it 's teeth one by one we mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week
i bought my first one about 14 months ago it lasted about 8 months motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over i dismantled the whole unit it then worked for about 2 days i called kitchenaid \( they are right about no hassle warranty \) they quickly sent me out a new one this new one lasted about 6 months and now has the same symptoms i really wish this was the grinder for me i love the capacity for bean storage and love the way it looks i have been forced to look at other grinders
i was happy with the performance of the strainer easy to clean , fit well over the edges of pans , etc but only a month after i received it , the handle snapped right off i was draining a can of vegetables , so it does n't seem to me that was overdoing it i 'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer i buy
i baked two batches of madelines side by side , one in this pan \( set on a baking sheet \) , and another in a traditional pan with non stick coating i brushed both pans with canola oil before using as per the package instructions , i allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them the madelines in the traditional pan released easily , were golden and high , and had a pronounced design the other batch were almost soggy \( probably from cooling in the pan \) , flat , pale , and did not have the appearance of a madeline to make matters worse , they did not release easily , and a few of them even broke as i attempted to remove them i would not recommend this pan
we were so looking forward to fresh lemondade the moment the salton arrived we opened the box , pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing on the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon we were all very disappoined , my 5 kids and i \( i had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others
i also tried some cotton wamsutta sheets from bed bath , and beyond and they pilled the first time i washed them i was able to return them to the store , but it was a waste of time i would n't recommend these sheets or any wamsutta sheets because i think they 're poor quality
these knives are already showing spots of rust despite washing by hand drying very disappointed in quality of finish
the blender looks very attractive but hardly works quite a bit of time even crushing a tomato hard to believ
this products is horrible it burns the rice and the heat actually bend the insert so the lid would not fit anymore and after using it only a handful of times it stopped working it is really terrible would give it zero but there is no option
do n't waste your money i bought this because it was small and i wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones
bought it two months ago , used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week called manufacturer , got return label , sent in for replacement , but three weeks passed and i still have not received anything so i called them on nov 17 , 2006 , and was told they do n't have this model in stock the worst part is that they also said they do not know when it will be ever in stock , maybe tomorrow or may in a year
i was really looking forward to receiving this , but four weeks after purchasing online , i received an email from amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase ! i am disappointed in amazon how can you sell something you do not have
there is one huge problem with these sheets they are not permanently pressed there is no way to get out the wrinkles , other than by ironing them otherwise , they are fine but who in the world wants wrinkled sheets ! you should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles like your average sheet these sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed i cannot believe you are actually selling these things on line
great price , poor product they are beautiful upon arrival i washed them according to manufacturer 's instructions you would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer \( usually a sign of poor fabric quality \) while folding them up , i discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed and i had n't even used them yet ! unbelievable i returned them for a full refund , including shipping \( and i stupidly purchased 2 sets \) goes to show you get what you pay for never again
works if you have cold soda and it 's frozen after 2 cans it 's done yes you get two of the sleeves , but i'm not pleased better luck with a 99 cent foam coozi
this light is made of cheap plastic , has a faulty switch , and broke down within an hour of use no good , waste of money , will not order from american science again very bad experience no response from company when i complained , would like my money back , and then some
the timer worked great at first , but in less than a month , the alarm for the timer has stopped working and the magnet has fallen off i am only keeping the timer because the clock and the stopwatch are still useful
i was at first very excited with my new zyliss salad spinner it looks great , and it 's much easier to spin than the older string pull version \( not to mention the old school pump versions , which required a lot of effort \) however , as another reviewer mentions , it simply does not get your greens very dry i 've been surprised and disappointed by the amount of water left on lettuce after spinning , and spinning , and spinning
pan was what was expected but the muffins do not come out looking like a mushroom i was looking for a pan where the muffin top came over the muffin so you could break it off it 's hard to explain
the interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use it got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil a lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains , but the pan never got its new look back
bought this grinder after my capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing after using for about two weeks , i have to agree with other reviews that mention static problem the grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine the plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off
for years i used my mother 's cookie shooter to make my holiday spritz cookies when i bought my first house i wanted my own cookie shooter boy , i wish i had n't purchased this one
i cannot believe what a waste of money this thing was huge disappointment i was all excited when i got it , made some cookie press dough , put it in , and nothing the plunger pretty much spins in place i could push the dough out manually faster than this thing can i could n't even get one freakin' cookie out of it , onto the cookie sheet
i got the white color version and was happy about it but this one is half the goods worth
we thought this was smaller than pictured and not comfortable we were not pleased with this
i have had this pan for a year i bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set i figured it would be a good test run on the circulon brand it grills great , but you will spend twice the cooking time cleaning the pan ! i could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it you have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out it is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it i wonder if the calphalon pan is the same \? \? \? as far as the pot set i ended up buying analon titanium 12 piece highly reccomend it
while this was great to not scratch my non stick pans , it melted while using it in an aluminum pan ! would not recommend
pros the oven part works great i like the fact that it is controlled by a timer , meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off for cooking things , the double rack is also handy , although you only get one pan \( luckily , i saved the pan from my old toaster oven \)
the fan was great , with lots of breeze and circulation it is loud , but who cared \?
just bought this item this week , was very excited about using it for the first time turned out to be a huge mess the stove turned black right under the grill , it took like 20 min to clean it up , burned up mess also there there is soo much smoke coming from the grill i had to shut off the smoke detector for a while overall the food came out pretty good but the mess with the stove really upset me
this product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all very
i own many kitchenaid appliances and love the brand i even own a silicone muffin pan which i love this pan , however , is terrible the cake did not bake completely and i had a terrible time trying to get it out of the pan \( yes , i sprayed the pan effectively \) do not waste your money ! stick to the metal pans
this is a beautiful blue color , coordinates with my kitchen however , i 'll bake my poundcakes in my old , reliable metal pans i tried to use this a few times , spraying every nook and cranny with baker 's secret release spray without fail , each time the cake stuck to the pan in a few places
i loved the way the vortex digital heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch but within a week , the one i had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on i was worried that it was overheating all the time and called vortex who told me i could send it in at my expense and pay 15 to fix it i emailed my amazon seller \( louise at pinnacle packaging \) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her , and is going to refund my money i think i am going to buy another one only i am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure i can bring it back if the new one does the same thing i guess i am a sucker but i really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly
good size , good color but way too stiff i washed these 5 times with no change
i miss soy yogurts ! ! ! i 've been used to make soy yogurts in france i 've bought this yogurt maker i 've tried several times to make some but it never worked i 've followed the recipe using plain soy milk and one plain yogurt has anyone got a recipe for me \? i'm allergic to lactose
bought this item last christmas for my wife worked fine until this thanksgiving when rubber bulb split apart when basting turkey she had complained when i bought this fancy one to replace her old ugly plastic one last year but i insisted this was better boy am i in trouble now old plastic one had lasted for 10 years and cost 1 10 as much did not look like much but it did the job
and bit the dust i use it once a year for 3 days i'm estimating it made coffee 10 times now it wont brew anything but weak coffee if you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak i was going to call faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute for what \? like the last guy said it 's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee it 's a throwaway so , this time i 'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working i 'll throw it away at least i wont be thrwing away 150 bucks
i agree completely with the review by terry gruggen as she said in her feb review ,
not incredibly impressed with it , but it does keep me warm for the price i paid
the way specifications were mentioned it sounded a very good deal , and price comparision made it very promissing , but after getting the item i found item is a trash quality i have ever seen in my life if someone give me a free item like this i wo n't take it do n't fall for this deal i am very disappointed with this item
i ordered this thinking that i 'd save a bundle , and have a really nice comforter set not ! the product description promised navy and sage , but it is black and sage it is the cheapest looking comforter that i have ever seen i sent mine back yesterday i just ca n't let the seller get away with the totally inaccurate description and the deception in claiming that this product was originally 200 dollars
after operating the petmate fresh flow cat fountain for a month my 2 cats wo n't go anywhere near it very disappointing !
this has been used twice the first time i used it , it made a great smoothie i tried to use it this past independence day and the pulse stopped and started continuously after a while , something smelled like it was burning on the bottom , there appears to be lots of specks of metal do n't think i 'll be buying a new one
i used this smoothie machine once , and it made a nice smoothie the second time it locked up and i could smell something burning in the motor i used the exact measurements for liquids and frozen fruit , so i'm confident i did n't do anything wrong i sent it back for a refund immediately
we also bought the fcp12 after years of hearing from satisfied farberware users unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm , tea like coffee i removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so after a few times of this monkey business , i contacted farberware and was told i had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base the best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price shipping would be on me both directions as well , i told them i would not pay any price for another one of their products , based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it i am going to try replacing the thermostat , as i like perked coffee , but i am not convinced it will last any longer , time will tell
i never got to use this item i turned it on and for some reason the heat seemed transfered to the screws in the hinge it just fell apart and started smoking the hinge was very cheaply made i would not buy this product again
stainless steel and die cast aluminum construction promises performance , but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use the waring fs800 pro electric food slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull this is definitely not a professional quality food slicer , it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best
this liner is non slip which is nice and even home made chocolate chip cookies dont stick but it looks dirty and baking residue is sticking to it even after i have put it in the dishwasher my other liner is a chef 's planet full size baking sheet non stick bakeliner and while it can slip a bit and dos n't have a finished edge it dose have the advantage of wipe down clean up and it arrives in a large sheet that you custom cut to fit any baking sheet \( s \) you will be using it with do n't buy this liner but do buy the non stick bakeliner from chef 's planet it 's not as pretty but it works like a charm ! after years of buying expensive parchment paper i 'll never go back also , it 's less wastfull to use a bake liner instead of disposable baking sheets or parchment paper
i thought the four 4 5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9 0 inch springform pan after all , the areas are equal , i e 4 2 25 2 25 pi 4 5 4 5 pi i thought i could use the recipe for a 9 inch cheesecake and have 4 4 5 inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts
i used my hoover agility for the first time and the suction quit after 5 minutes i followed all the trouble shooting instructions and it still did n't work i called hoover and spoke with a rep who was basically reading out of the manual i sat on hold for 21 minutes only to hear a manager tell me that they cannot give out technical information because it 's against their policy i guess this is to ensure their hoover service centers get the business i'm returning the hoover and never purchasing a hoover again
the cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant i placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again i prefer a thick cutting board so i bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so i would n't purchase them again
i bought this back in 1999 , and i love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks , but it 's not built to last first , after about 3 years , the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight , and then the 5th year , the knob broke off , so i have to use pliers to turn it on it still cooks chicken great , but after trying to superglue the feet back on and the knob , they broke again right away
i really liked this spatula in the beginning , but after just 6 months of very gentle use its head developed cracks and chipped
after thoroughly checking toaster reviews and ratings \( this got top ratings \) , i had to return it after several attempts to get it to produce evenly toasted bread very disappointing my old toastmaster \( much less expensive \) does better
we have not been able to use the sheets because they are so stiff and rough they are wrinkled and no matter how many times they are washed they do not soften the pillowcases are too narrow for our regular size pillows which makes the pillows too high and hard to be comfortable we are totally dissatisfied and thoroughly disappointed and will be returning them if for no other reason than to get them out of the house we do like the color , though
i was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and i have 600 thread count sheets that we love these , i do not love so much this is why
nice pattern , but you cannot find the glasses that go with it
this breadmaker is not doing what i want it is so touchy , you have to be very very precise to be able to cook a reasonable bread loaf i am not satisfied with the product and will try to return it also it works very noisy during dough process
i was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived way too large for my countertop at least it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly i mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product it is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets
i bought this to simplify making fries , it was a disappointment it takes a lot of effort to push through a potato , and when it does go through it most likely wo n't go straight either save your money and use a knife , or spend more and get a mandoline
i found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill
after cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan , i'm sad to say that my non stick pan sticks we 've had this pan for maybe 8 months and i just assumed that pans lasted for several years we even bought this pan plus the 8 for my mother in law for christmas what a disappointment better begin research on a new pan and i 'll make sure to read the reviews
when i first bought this pan i was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from costco that pan lasted about 3 years and i got my money 's worth
after your pan starts sticking , you go to their web site to complain and you find a warning that you ca n't use high heat on this pan they warn you if you use high heat or some sprays , the pan will then start to stick yes , you 've just been and you paid 40 for the privilege imagine , a frying pan that does n't like heat how much heat \? they do n't tell you if your pan is sticking , then it must have been toooo much buy at your own risk
if you are planning to purchase anything from getapc com , the markeplace vendor selling this item , beware i purchased the delonghi 5 quart mixer based on product description and customer reviews but found that it did not perform as expected it froze up kneading a 2 loaf batch of whole grain bread the design is beautiful and the mixer is probably good for non artisan breads , but should you have any problems with it , you 'll have to stay on the vendor to get any kind of response i am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks the last message i got was that it may take a bit longer so be sure this is what you want before you buy it returning it is not easy and getapc com charges a 60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you 'll have to pay to send it back my markeplace experience has been very frustrating i wo n't buy through the marketplace again if amazon com or getapc com processes my refund in the next day or two , i 'll feel better and will edit my review , but for now , buyer beware
i purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about 7 each the latest probe just malfunctioned i really loved it at first perfectly roasted chickens , loin roasts , and turkeys oddly enough , the thermometer works great but the probe itself is n't designed to handle much time in the oven if you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven , the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable even at lower temperatures , the heat finally takes its' toll it just takes longer for it to happen one would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat i will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working , it is great that is worth 7 a year for me but not for everyone per another reviewers advice , i am calling polder
this unit was a great addition until the probe went bad after only a few months not recommended
when it worked it worked well however , eight months into this and i only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times , it 's broken i have not done anything to it , and one day the the display is just messed up i can see a line here and there , but nothing else replacing the battery did not help and polder 's website offers no information such as warranty information it is defintely not worth 30
i bought this air cleaner in march of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in january 04 there was no indication that anything was amiss , i was changing the pre filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing no lights , no sound , no activity am sending it back to honeywell \( on my nickel according to their warranty policy \) we will see how long the replacement lasts i have read several reviews here that do n't give me much hope amazon was nice , said i needed to contact honeywell directly but suggested i post a review
i was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and i needed to send it back for a refund
i purchased this as a christmas gift in early december it did n't ship until february , which was okay by then i liked the way it looked so much , i bought one for myself they both arrived within a week of one another
this item is priced wrong it is not in line with the other calphalon item
considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself , \( all excessive , by the way \) the carafes have much to be desired it seems as if they are made with spun sugar extremely fragile , awkward handle and like a comment already listed , i too have replaced the carafe twice making three so far my krups carafe of 10 years is still intact if they still made the filters , i would still be using that machine
purchased this , expecting better functionality sure it does n't rust , but my 5 wustoff pealer works much better
this sharpener seemed to work well , but that was before i noticed it was putting chips in the edge of the knife
this chopper , if you can call it that , is terrible i 've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese i 've tried filling up the bowl , half full and barely anything at all it does n't chop plain and simple it just does n't chop the food i 've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade then , i 'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again it started to chop a little a couple of times , but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing
i was so excited at the prospect of having a 3 cup mini chopper i thought it would be ideal for hummus , which i hate to scrape out of my blender however , it was very disappointing on either speed , it just seems to chop what is in the center , so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside unchopped if i wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around , i 'd use the blender , no \? i nearly pureed some red pepper , trying to get it all chopped i have a 2 cup mini chopper \( procter silex , i think \) that is really much better at consistent chopping i never had to take the top off of it unfortunately , the bowl got warped in the dishwasher \( even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe \) and the lid does not fit tightly now , making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs still , even warped , i find myself using the old one instead of this new one it is really that bad !
openning a dog food can is nearly impossible without at least 6 or 7 tries to get the blade to catch i bought it i regret the purchase i threw it out this really hurts the cuisinart image
dont plan on cutting anything you need a sharp knife for other than that , it 's ok
this is a very nice small oven , but as a toaster it really drives me up the wall as someone else said , three knobs to adjust just to make toast ! then you have to stand there and watch it and the toast still burns !
ugly and cheap looking wife hated them now using as rags to wash the ca
these towels are very poor quality ! i guess i can use them to dry off my dogs if you really want cheap almost see through towels these are the ones for you
the coating does not last extremely poor durability i 've been very careful with this pan , using only wood or plastic utensils and washing by hand only did n't matter within just a few uses , the coating flaked off and the edges on the underside are rusting waste of money
i received two of these baking sheets for christmas last year by march , 1 3 of the teflon was gone in spots by july , it was coming off in sheets when washed these never went through the dishwasher always hand washed i threw them away and purchased baker 's secret which seems to be satisfactory so far
i would never buy this product again the finish came off almost immediately do n't waste your money
i really loved this baking sheet when i first got it , so i was supremely disappointed when the nonstick coating began flaking off , essentially rendering it unusable i may have gotten a bad batch or something the product has a lifetime warantee and i do intend to send it back in , but wanted to let folks know about my experience
have been using the set for less than a month rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles right at the seams looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle unless design is changed , do n't know how replacement knives will be any different too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully
i bought these plates after i already had the rest of the matching dishes i already knew that i was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last
i thought this was the answer to my crock pot prayers ! i received it for christmas and was heart broken to realize that you can choose high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10 hours \( look at the product image enlarged \) most things i cook take 6 hours on low ! i occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours unfortunately , if it does n't do the time you need , it is completely useless you would have to be home to turn it off or down so i returned it and am making do with my select brands corningware programmable , \( it does n't do 6 hours on low either \) and a regular 3 quart i just make it home in time or i do n't cook it
i found this sealer to be difficult to use it is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle extreme pressure is needed to hold down and lock the top in order to create the vacuum and seal the bag if you let up on the pressure , the vacuum seal is broken i returned mine and would never buy another rival sealer product again
i accidentally ruined my father 's old baking stone so i bought this on for him to replace it everything sticks to it ! we thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking we 've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it that 's not even the worst of it it puts out a disgusting smell in the oven just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing i definitely do not recommend this item
i thought that 1200 thread count meant really soft while these sheets are really thick , they feel like sand paper if you 're looking for soft sheets , do n't buy these
even though i cleaned the machine between each empty and fill , if i did not have white carpet i would not have known this machine leaks the dirty water back onto the carpet i had to shampoo the carpet two more times to remove the extra spots left in the carpet a second time with detergent to remove the spots and then immediately with a rinse only cycle my second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space i had to change it out about every 10 minutes the machine gets one star for the dual brushes which i think are a positive for this machine unfortunately , that was not enough for me to keep it it would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact i had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area i 've had a hoover for 8 10 years and will look to see what new machines hoover has on the market
the v2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about 250 without exaggeration i have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece \( breaks \) , a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly it seems to fall apart , leak , and requires constant attention i now have to go to have a repair of the brushes they do n't rotate and this is with use maybe once a month frankly , i 'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable \( and expensive \) quality
these were sent instead of the black handled set i ordered so i thought i would give them a try they are listed as dishwasher safe , but evidently are not brown stains \( rust \? \) appeared on the tops of all the handles i cleaned them with silver polish , but the stains reappeared with subsequent washings i have returned them and received a refund
i brought t fal pans from my local sam 's club wearhouse , and initially , the pans worked great this is my review after about 1 5 years of use
after very little use one of the glasses inner lining broke and is unusable
i liked the mug 's look , feel , size then i took a drink of java from this mug i never could get a lip lock on this mug the rim is very thin very wide it would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt nissan mugs have what i call a lip ledge that prevents the dribble effect to which the bodum is prone nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts
this product did not even approach what was described a bagutte pan needs to have a decent sized curvature so a bagutte shape will be obtained this pan would have produced a fairly flat loaf
i am really dissapointed with this bread machine !
it 's just bad looking plastic if you want expresso buy nespresso machine with capsules
well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking the copper does , indeed , boil water fast and that 's the job of a kettle , i admit however , the button trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you 're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle as you tilt the kettle to pour , you 're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers it 's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst
my wife and i purchased the 40616 hamilton beach perculator at k mart after only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot only luke warm k mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days this should give you an idea of what k mart thinks of the quality of the hamilton beach 40616 perculator when i called hamilton beach customer no service i was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for 9 95 and they would replace their defective equipment the 9 95
i feel it was an unlucky day when i bought this pot as careful as i tried to be , it was extremely difficult to tell if i had correctly placed the stem \( with basket \) in the pit it had to be by feel , and half the time it was apparently a hair 's breadth off and would not perk or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet it was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot a hair 's breadth off and again it would n't perk so each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day i got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds i am returning to my old friend , the farberware fc280 it may or may not last more than a year but at least i can depend on it
not much to say about this item it sucks very thin and cheap made does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah this is the worst product i have every got from amazon
i agree with the previous reviewers the style is quite sleek and the ceramic , earthen material eliminates the metallic taste of the water
why would anyone want pots that ca n't be used on high heat , ca n't be washed in the dishwasher or ca n't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish my calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly i have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who have n't owned these pots for long
i just received this knife yesterday am sending it back for a refund upon first use , the forked metal tip broke off when i was chopping tomatoes for a salad it took me a few moments to notice the lost tip \( as it had ended up in the salad i was preparing \) could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip ! the knife itself is flimsy , ca n't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well
i folowed the instructions and found that the coffee was very weak so i experimented with differint grinds and filter no filter i found not useing the paper filter and grinding the coffee expresso and stoping the water when it starts to look pale makes a med strong cup a lot of work for a decent cup i still think that my old krups drip makes a great cup i will keep trying other alternets to the pods becous there very expensive i am waiting for some one to start manufacturing a home pod maker that you can fill seel at home
i have had the blue ecopods for well over a year now ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean
i thought that this would actually be something that i would need when i registered for this for my wedding but this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use sure kids might like to use it when they cook , but in all the time that i have owned one , i have only used it once its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards you are better off without it
it may work o k for melons , but the handle is extremely uncomfortable and ackward to grip when attempting to scoop ice cream in addition , the shape of the scoop bowl makes it difficult to get a full scoop of ice cream
i bought this coffee maker to match my kitchenaid blender and coffee gridner the coffee maker is attractive but works terribly if you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top there is almost always grounds in the coffee too when i called kitchenaid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one it has the same problems this is not user error i have tried different coffees , grinds , and positioning the carafe differently this coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake finally i got kitchenaid to buy the coffee maker back and got a cuisinart one it works perfectly , costs less , and has more features i would recommend cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker you will regret it
i have several other kitchen aid appliances and they are all great solid , hefty machines that do superior work , the type of items kitchen aid has built a reputation on so that is why i bought this coffee maker \( actually i have the previous model before this update \) boy , howdy ! was i blind sighted ! the quality of the housing is no better than a mr coffee for 1 4 the price , and i too , have experienced the leaking problems like other reviewers have noted and on mine , the spring that keeps the shut off unit down while you take the pot off the machine to have that first cup while it is still brewing well , it decided to not do it 's job only after about a month of owning it the unit leaks coffee as if that is what it was designed to do hey , kitchen aid engineers do you read these amazon reviews \? if you do , then go back to the drawing board and make a coffee maker that is in line with your other products ! and give those of us that bought your previous junk a full credit trade in to upgrade to it once it is available ! how hard is it to make a good coffee maker \? my grandma's early 70's mr coffee is still perking strong what an embarassment to kitchen aid nuff' said
i got this on sale from targets for 35 eagerly i plugged in the unit , turned the variable dial to maximum steam , and increased the digital dial to 7 and then i waited , and waited , and waited , for 10 minutes the iron never warmed up , let alone hot enough to iron anything i ca n't say this is a bad product , but surely i got a non working unit
this iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while i was using it i was pressing a shirt when suddenly the led display on the iron shut off and started beeping repeatedly i smelled smoke and the handle was hot to the touch i lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark on my brand new shirt !
both pads burned on the backside the first time i used them they are still serviceable , but the burned areas are hard they were used in a normal kitchen no blow torches
be careful to buy products from compact appliance they will not be responsible if the product is defective from the manufacturer there is no return you better think more than twice before you buy from compact appliance they have the worst customer service including the manufacturer edgestar
box arrived damaged opened product , scratched on front , dirty on the inside after i cleaned it up it worked great for a week then poof no power at all thought i may have ran it too much so i left it unplugged for 24 hours then plugged it back in and nothing additionally customer service for edgestar is terrible i have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 e mails back and forth with their customer service \( haha \) reps and still have made zero progress buy with caution
i ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother , shortly before thanksgiving of 2002 the first time it arrived , after 3 weeks , it was in about 1 , 000 pieces the ups driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item when it was sent the second time , which was n't until around christmas , it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off so , long story short , no cake plate for mom ! amazon com should really examine how they pack items like this
i wanted to like this toaster it looks nice , seems sturdy enough , and stays cool to the touch but it toasts poorly one side of the bread toasts more than the other so i have to pop up the toast 1 2 way through and turn it over and now the pop up mechanism is n't working well
if you prefer having bread that is toasted on both sides look elsewhere for a toaster even when it is not on the bagel setting it does not do any more than barely warm one side of bread
as soon as i opened it and tried to remove the lid for cleaning , it broke ! no instructions provided on how to remove , replace the removable parts
i finally gave up after trying three of the hunter fans and got my money back even on the lowest speed , this thing rattles , shakes , and groans i own five hunter ceiling fans , which are great this fan does n't deserve the hunter nameplate
i like the cookware solid as calphalon always is , if you follow the link on the bonus item , it shows a 1 2 day availability today is dec 26 , ordered on nov 9 still waiting for the bonus
i had older 500 thread count sheets that were better , lighter , smoother these feel like 200 thread count sheets complete waste of money
this fork thermometer would have been great if it had lasted more than 3 usages no way to notify the manufacturer to find out why the fork quit working it 's still useful as a meat fork , but not as a thermometer very disappointing and a bit expensive to be used only as a fork
i bought t fal 's top of the line avantis iron even though i only have light ironing to do it broke in less than a year losing heat completely t fal would not stand behind it i wrote to them several times they insisted on the original sales receipt despite the fact i had the charge on my american express bill they had no technical advise either read other amazon reviews on their products breakdowns ! i 've paid half as much for irons that lasted for years avoid this turkey and this company i 'll never buy another t fal product and neither should you
a normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse this machine requires a wash , rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit you ca n't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out
a friend bought a food saver by tilia and told me that it would be wonderful for storing my bulk shopping in the freezer i saved for it and got it i used it a total of 10 times and not for long periods of time and it literally died i sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell just be careful and do not let this happen to you tilia looks much better on tv than it performs in real life
the top portion of the freezer works great the bottom drawer portion sounded great no more digging to see what 's at the bottom the reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator i do n't put anything in that part that i'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures it 's a disappoinment
the product is an average product , do not think it is a top seller , another retailer has the same item cheaper the delivery and customer service is the wrost i have ever experienced would not order this item again with the poor delivery
the holes are really small this grater is suitable for hard cheeses like romano , but forget using it for a softer cheese like cheddar
this product simply does not work the vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine , even for a day i have used a vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost we bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the vacuvin and it is the reason it does n't preserve the wine i am seeking a return and refund , either through amazon or metrokane
i honestly liked the blender a lot i received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen 's kitchenaid appliances range , refrigerator , dishwasher , pretty much everything other than the toaster oven at the time , there could be no better blender it looked great it promised professional performance it had kitchenaid 's brand and durability behind it
mine broke and started smoking while i was making hummus \( not even something tougher like ice \) kitchenaid wo n't fix it there are many much cheaper but nicer ones on the market
i find that such a well known brand would have a longer warranty than 12 months my blender broke \( it was the coupler \) after about 18 months of use i emailed ka about it and all they did was give me two repair shops where i could pay to have it fixed both repair shops are more than one hour away they also offered me off a refurbished blender gee what service you 'd think they 'd at least work with me since the blender was n't even 2 years old for i went out and bought a cuisinart and that comes with a 3 year warranty ka blender was not worth my it never blended fruit all the way , either it always left chunks of bananas
my husband sweats a lot at night and i thought this would stop the problem it did n't at all it does n't seems like it does anything for me either it just feels like a normal mattress pad not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad
i just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom however , after using it several times , i would choose a different grill because of the following reasons
we 've had 3 sets in just over 1 1 2 years return policy is great but it 's a hassle ca n't oneida make silverware that does n't rust \? i'm going to try a different brand
i have numerous le creuset items , and this has to be the worst one everything sticks to the finish salsbury steak turns out horrible \( ca n't make gravy \) , breakfast sausage patties become ground sausage pieces due to the sticking and , like mentioned in an earlier post , it is hard to clean beware this new finish , \( they have it on their grill pans also \) it is not up to par
i'm a huge fan of le cruest 's products and own a few well chosen pieces having said that , this new satin finish is a disappointment i was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled until i used it
door advance feature broke after several weeks lower heating element broke after six months customer service refused to stand behind the product , stating that the warranty was expired note to buyer warranty is one year from time of manufacture not the date you actually receive it as a gift or purchase it the knobs on the unit are like a child 's toy cheap and plastic this is a highly disappointing product i doubt we will buy another delonghi product again
the second one came today it is also dead on arrival
i , too , own several kitchenaid products and have been delighted with previous products when i needed a new coffee maker , i decided to switch brands to kitchenaid based on prior history with the company
i'm usually a big fan of kitchenaid appliances and i own a proline coffee grinder , which is excellent but , i could not get a good full flavored cup of coffeee out of this machine i usually brew 4 cups at a time they have a setting for 1 4 cups , but the coffeee still turned out slightly weak and slightly bitter i returned it and will try something else
i love kitchenaid products , but this one failed miserably ! !
the salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls , that the new kitchenaid was sure to be a huge improvement , especially with it 's price tag we 've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages the manual 's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this also , we 've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out for the price tag , this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker we finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model \( not kitchenaid \) oddly enough , our other kitchenaid appliances \( range and fridge \) have also had electronic problems i wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured , no doubt , in some overseas location i would n't recommend kitchenaid to anyone , regardless of the nice styling and supposed high quality
ordered it in october , now it 's january 8th !
this krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used i think the built in safety features are to blame the finer the grind , the more water leaked out keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino
i jumped on purchasing this machine when i saw it i was tired of storing beans in the freezer i put 4 aa batteries in it and a pound of beans , closed the lid and the sucking sound started and it kept going , and kept going , and kept going i started looking for places to store it so that it would n't wake me up at night or disturb me with it 's annoying hum first thing in the morning but i did n't have to worry , but the next morning the batteries were dead i replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again ! there is no place to plug it in so you 're stuck with using batteries i'm going to try buying rechargables but i do n't know how long i'm going to want to keep this replacement going ! !
i have two roomba 's , after one year of good operation they have been having battery problems one roomba was returned for refurbishment they have good customer service , if you pursue them the newly returned roomba still has battery problems the housekeeper which was very excited when i bought the roomba now uses the vacuum cleaner
amazon took over a month in shipping me this roomba battery it works ok also the list price is too high on this amazon site
what a shame that this appliance fails at its sole purpose in life let 's hope there 's a support group for mediocre toasters
recommended
a well made no frills percolator it packs well , is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee the ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use a superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers
i would have given this no stars but it wo n't let me this non stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape it is simply the worst product i have purchased in a long time i have this non stick griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash the non stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless , it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds do n't buy it ! ! ! if you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like i did before it met the old trash can
fyi , those of you with square burners will not like this one it is not stable because of the design , which is clearly meant for round burners
the sheets arrived soft and after washing stayed colorfast but shrunk they were difficult to get on the mattress
after one wash the fitted sheet shrank and color leeched onto it so it has grey splotches in places we do n't even have a deep mattress but now the bare mattress shows on the sides it 'll have to go in our next garage sale
i purchased this about 1 year ago and it 's only taking up space in my house it has very poor suction on carpeting works o k on hardwood floors but then again most of these will i expected better force the small openning may look cool but it does n't allow for wide enough sweeping area and i find myself going over the same area again and again also , the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in i would consider look at others first
the convenience tempted me to try this for 20 at my local grocery poorly executed constructed , the pods were too expensive bland will be donating this to charity
the coffee maker was working fine as long as i was using the presto mypods with no filter in them
i am on my third machine now , and it too is leaking dont get me wrong , the coffee tastes really good , always fresh but after a while the machine starts to leak when you are making a cup of coffee i guess the machine only cost 25 bucks now , so if you dont mind only using it for a month it is a great buy
i bought this cookie press to make my favorite christmas cookies spritz i got the dough into the gun , squeezed the handle , kept squeezing the handle , and nothing the mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping , and hence , no cookies it was very frustrating , having everything ready to make the cookies , but with no way to properly form them i would not recommend this cookie press
this is a disapointment for me i ordered these sheets in white , and recieved ivory \( unlike other reviewers i am not talking about a tinge of ivory , my package said ivory instead of white \) i would return these sheets , but they are a gift for my mother , and since they took so long to ship , i wo n't have time to get her anything else ! i have never had a bad experience with amazon products , some of the third party sellers could be better , but usually amazon it 's self is pretty good not in this case ! the sheets do feel nice , and hopefully they work out for my mother , but i am keeping my paperwork and packaging just incase she runs into any problems !
we purchased the george foreman 8 in 1 with the thought we would get the toaster oven we needed and some other features that would be nice to have the 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features , the issue is it does n't do any of the features very well the toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller , more conventional toaster oven the rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate we found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter i can see this being a very good item for those with very small kitchens and in need of saving space , however , be warned that this oven has many shortcomings
fiesta scarlet is a beautiful color and the sugar and creamer with tray is really great mine arrived broken and i had difficulty returning it so i remain disappointed and unwilling to try again
definitely not up to typical cuisinart standards while the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup , it 's relatively thin in a 400 degree oven , the pan actually bows
i do n't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending but this blender is junk i have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job all of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom so , you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated and then try adding the crushed ice this blender is going back
we purchased a delonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired we barely used this product when contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us my 20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years ! this is the lsat time i buy a toaster based on appearance
i received the delonghi xr640 toaster oven and was disappointed to find it unuseable the wire rack inside was such a tight fit , it took 2 hands to pull it out ! after a few times doing this , the enamel finish was starting to come off , which would soon result in rusting metal i never turned it on , just returned it immediately
i 've been happy with many other kitchenaid products , but this one is pure junk the pasta roller attachment that kitchenaid also offers is great , but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press , that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal and many of them pop open
firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one i now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile it 's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them i 'll be looking for something a bit more durable
while the combined grinding and making of the coffee in one unit is a great idea , the mess that it created was a pain to clean up each day the grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again i had the product three months and it quit working the good thing is that when we call cuisinart 's 800 number , they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back
i think it is almost a great idea ! it would be super if made of glass i do n't want to be concerned with material for which i use it ! i would buy a couple if made of glass , otherwise not
for approximately six months i owned this knife i used it everyday as it far outshined my other henkel chefs knife in balance , cutting efficiency and need for regular sharpening until a few weeks ago when i was peeling a clove of garlic with the knife lo and behold i know have a two inch blade attached to the handle and five inches of steel sitting on the countertop i am currently looking for other brands of this knife style as i was unhappy with the manufactures complete lack of response regarding my complaint
every time i use the pan is twists as soon as it gets hot it makes it very difficult to cook on and to move in and out of the oven the non stick surface comes off very easily too
i completely agree with the other reviewers this product is so bad it warps under the heat , the not so non stick surface peels , and food sticks like glue
i have used the steamer once , and was disappointed at how long it took the steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times i was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers , and it took a lot of going over to get it done i used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster this one will probably work on heavier material like drapes , but it will take a very long time i would n't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items , and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job a hand unit makes more sense to me , and you would n't have to maneuver that long hose this is just one more large thing to store i wish i could return it to wal mart , but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use
i hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning so , i was really excited when i saw this steamer at cvs it was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful i was bragging about how much i loved this steamer after using it just once ! it was easy and fast then , the second time i used it water everywhere !
i am a trained research assistant therefore , i try to research products before i purchase them in the case of this purchase , i saw the item during an early bird sale at kohls , so i grabbed it i owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness , but it is really bulky , so i thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice on the contrary , it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse , and although it was on sale , it was a waste of money the problems i had were
this is a dangerous steamer sometimes it will pour steaming water and burn you badly definitely not recommended i am throwing mine away
this is not aubergine , a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin , but it is a light , bright purple sitting on my kitchen countertop , it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning glowing , shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting caveat emptor , unless you 're color blind or really like bright purple
threw it in the trash ! it was awful ! ! horrible to clean , did n't chop right pass on this one ! ! bought an unknown brand for 9 99 and love it
i 've been using a large cusinart for over 10 years it is marvelous , so i decided to get the mini mate chopper for smaller jobs
i strongly agree with the last reviewer this unit is extremely overpriced i also have a all metal zinc alloy unit that included 2 extra worms , aluminum foilcutter , stainless steel bottle stopper and pourer and gift box for 25 this one , at 150 , still has a plastic body
i bought this blender to make pie pastry , and i was thoroughly disappointed the wires do n't cut because they just widen and the pieces of butter slip through i spent a lot of muscle to obtain a very poor result the handle is nice but it just does n't get the job done
i just bought this toaster \( not on amazon \) to replace a black decker toaster oven that had served well for more than 10 years this new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze this is a very dangerous appliance that , based on my experience and other reviews here , should probably be taken off the market and recalled
this item fell apart the moment i took it out of the box the sides literally came apart do not buy this product the company should be ashamed for even selling it
we have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling \( balling up \) very badly it is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set when you see 500 thread count , you expect more from the sheet but i guess we should have know what to expect given the low price i suppose you get what you pay for take my advice and do n't throw away this
i agree with the previous reviewer that these are difficult to clean and dry i could never get mine really clean so i threw them out
although i like the concept of these storage containers , they crack very easily the bottom of one of the largest containers had cracked during shipping \( still useable for dry things like flour \) then as i was sitting on the floor putting the containers away in a bottom cabinet , i dropped on from 1 2 feet above a linoleum floor it too chipped and cracked at the point of impact also , when i first unpacked the containers , one of the lids came apart and the bottom half became stuck in the container we had to use a knife fork and 2 people to pry it out , doing some damage in the process i believe the click clack folks have developed a second or even third generation of these containers perhaps they are sturdier on the positive side , i did store some tomatoe sauce in one of the containers and it did not stain
i purchased 5 of these dishes \( at 9 99 each \) to give as christmas gifts spode is manufactured in england , but the sub standard knock offs i received came from china the color is dull and grayish return shipping would be outrageous , so i'm stuck with 5 ugly dishes
this phone would be great if it did not have the worst static come and go several times throughout a call it never fails , when i need to make a really important call the static is so loud i ca n't hear at all every time we use it the static interrupts our conversation because we ca n't hear and target would n't take it back without the box how long are we supposed to keep the box reasonably !
the design is ok nothing fancy , nothing different , it looks just like any other teakettle it works fine the handle does n't get hot , and the whistle is n't too loud i gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside i washed it before using it , and after the water was done boiling , i saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird the smell may have been caused by that black stuff i washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out i took one piece and noticed it was gooey i checked if there was something that had melted when i boiled the water , but i saw the kettle was intact i boiled more water and again i saw the black goo floating in the water i have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times , and there is still goo floating in the water , they are almost unnoticeable , like very tiny dots , but they are there at least the funny smell is gone i do n't know what that black goo is or what 's causing it or where it 's coming from i'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful if i keep seeing black goo , i'm sending it back i think i 've learned my lesson when it comes to buying cookware , it 's better to buy good quality it 's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks
i have read a few reviews about this machine and some how i am not sure what i missed i purchased this machine about 8 months ago i loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances that is where it ends
i have had the cuisinart dcc 2000 coffeemaker for about six months or so and loved it this morning , however , it decided to stop working correctly i left the kitchen while it was brewing and all of the coffee leaked all over the counter what a mess ! i then made just 2 cups and put a coffee cup under the spout and watched it sure enough as the coffee was brewing the spout was spewing i do n't know what coffeemaker to buy now
the cooking set looks great however , once you heat the pot pan , the steel material handles become super hot i have to return the huge box
granted i have never had feather pillows before so maybe this is what is to be eppected but they have no neck support whatsoever , they make disturbing crunching noises whenever i move my head and they positively reek like a dirty henhouse gross ! home on the range ai n't for me i detest these , and threw them out
i love the way the tefal deep fryer cooks , however , i am returning my second one due to a defective lid closure the lid may close initially , but after a few uses it no longer stays closed since i have small children in my home , i will not be purchasing this one again
very disappointing ! spend your money somewhere else i threw away a perfectly good but old made in the usa thermos bottle and bought this made in china nissan 0 79 quart stainless steel insulated bottle back in june of 2005 ten months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it evidence of the loss of its insulating function i think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which i think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside when you spend 25 one would think it 's a good quality product think again
i bought this thermomter after watching goods eats with alton brown , because when i make buttercream frosting i wanted to be able to clip on the thermometer to the pot and get an accurate reading well this themometer did a lousy job at staying clipped onto the pot , it kept falling off no matter how i put it on i even tried using other pots , but no luck i am so mad that i paid so much money for this crappy gadget , it sucks
i used this thermometer fewer than 10 times before it stopped working for the most part , it no longer registers any temperature , and when it does it reads 75 100 degrees too cool while it was working , i definitely preferred it to my analog candy thermometer because it was less bulky , but i certainly ca n't recommend it now
this is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing first of all , this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones , especially the height i ca n't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter this takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops the whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box in just about 3 months of daily use , i 've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks , i 'd rather go back to pouring my own cups the only reason i have n't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and i do n't want to hurt her feelings
i purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot in the past i have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers at first , i was very pleased with the unit and thought i made a great purchase eventually it started to drip and leak at random the handle in the water coffee holder broke the top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously finally , this week it decided that it was not going to work at all it will not make coffee it will turn on , but not brew i have only had this for a year and a half or so look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last \( it was only used 2 3 times a week
we received the hamilton beach brewstation 12 cup coffeemaker as a gift from my sister in law she loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us shortly after buying this for us , her coffeemaker started leaking she thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers
my spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues like the black decker 15 6v chv1560 cordless hand vacuum , the battery life is 4 months tops
i have had this product for about 2 years when we first got it , it worked great lasted about 10 min at a time now , we 're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down also , the clip which holds it to the base just broke , and i see that i am not the first person to experience this problem i do n't see anywhere to buy a replacement base , at this time , so i may end up just throwing the whole thing away
i am very disappointed with this product i was carving my thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing the motor continued to work , but the blades stopped moving the knife has only been used 3 times , but i had to throw it out today i opened the plastic case , and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft , and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth the nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless my prior knife , much less expensive , lasted for 18 years the cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress
we have had this toaster for approximately 3 yrs it has had mimimal use as we
zyliss makes different shaker with different color if you did n't catch this review , it is just because this color is n a they all leak
it has a terrible desing flaw i use it to mix and carry protein shakes i put the powder in , put the cap on and when i am ready put the milk or water , shake and drink too good to be rated 2 stars , is n't it \? well that was the good
unit is advertised as 5 quart what arrived is 2 quart , and much too small for my purposes
i have had the knife for a month , and now it is simply not sharp the knife does not hold it 's edge , and i have used it only on soft vegetables a few times
i bought this coffee pot after owning the older version of the grind and brew silly of me to think this would be an improvement the front load basket design is terrible it is a true pain to clean this section , you cannot get your hands or any tool i have in my kitchen to clean the mechanisms therefore , the brew basket sticks and at times the latch that holds the basket in will at times be gummed up then when you start to brew your coffee thinking that the latch is closed , its not its gummed up not a problem until the heat and moisture from the brewing coffee loosen the gunk up and your basket shoots out and the coffee brews all over your counter as many times as hubby and i try to clean this its become too much of a pain , this coffee pot is out of here and on its way to the curb i actually am contemplating sending it back to cuisinart in pieces ! ! ! ! ! !
i am not a fan of the pause and pour feature it is a button and if the pot is not directly under button the coffe over flows on two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot , casing grounds to overflow the filter i can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed i searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour i may have to remove button for 100 satisfaction but i love the red accents in my kitchen
i have been using a brita pitcher for years but with the last two boxes of filters , a green slime grew in the pitcher after less than a month of use i 've heard the brita faucet filter attachments are worse i'm looking for another product
i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw
wish i had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance nothing slow about it burns everything , even on the keep warm setting best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off if not , your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot i swear , this thing is possessed ! my old rival crock pot was the best appliance i ever purchased , this one is the worst !
i wish i had this one goes to the goodwill grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular , like a chicken breast hamburgers work best watch out for burns
i bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed first of all , the iron is very big and heavy that 's not really a problem by itself , but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did , it becomes a big problem the controls were hard to deal with turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder i can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron
maybe i just have stains that are too much for it , but this cleaner did n't seem to do very much , certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners and i'm not using it on very old le creuset either , everything i have is less than a year old maybe it does better on older stains !
the size is nice for 2 people cleaning is easy seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself you have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right
these knives are terrible ! the eversharp edge is finely serrated and tears the steak leaving pieces of meat hanging on the edges it rips the food instead of cutting it i thought the henckels name would be better than this do n't waste your money
as mentioned in a lot of other reviews , my water tank leaks like a sieve the unit is completely unusable when you see how poorly constructed the water tank is , you realize hoover has built a clearly defective product save yourself trouble , buy another brand of cleaner i will never buy a hoover product again
is this some sort of sick joke \? are you purposfully trying to be politically incorrect or what ! \? making fun of sombody 's disability like that is not funny and can produce long term mental anguish if you 're not careful , i'm going to take you to court
my wife and i ordered 2 sets of the corelle ware we even got a 10 discount automatically the order came quicker than expected and everything was in excellent shape we like this type of diningware better than china ware it is virtually indestructible i lkie amazon 's free shipping i 've purchased many things through amazon and have n't been disappointed
this grinder has a small capacity not as advertised if you follow directions , it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time also , for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it the cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient finally , it is much more noisy than my old one
after reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them , i went ahead and ordered this rice cooker after i received the cooker , i was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china , rather than japan , and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish
i loved this when i purchased it , then i noticed it did not do a perfect job , then it would take a while to get going , then it smoked and died not worth it
took the blender out of the box cleaned the jar and lid and started trying to use it ran for a few seconds and then i started smelling something burning and the blender quit i attempted to contact customer support and could n't get through the telephone message suggested i leave a message and they would call back i attempted to leave a message but it said the mailbox was full not a good sign
we have had this garlic press for a number of years , but now its handles have turned so gummy from repeated dishwashing that they turn the kitchen counter black just by laying it down plan on buying a new one every couple of years
it is a strong knife and easy to grip but , i am upset about the rust spots on the blade , especially because i gave 2 people this knife as a gift ! it was very embarrassing ! i ca n't return it since it was a long distance gift
i'm sure this is a fine pizza wheel unfortunately , i 've not yet been able to use it , as the ! sticker that came attached to the blade is vitually impossible to remove geez
after many years of loving rowenta irons i have to say i am very disappointed the dx1700 it has already died on me the first few months it worked very well the steam power that most rowenta 's have is great but i am very disappointed that it will no longer heat up
the name revere ware used to mean exceptional quality , now it means just more chinese crap the bottom is so thin it ca n't have the logo stamped properly the redesigned handle has an impossible to wash void in it in all fairness it is better than most imported junk
i handwashed this one time and it filled up with water i did n't expect to be able to wash it in the dishwasher but i also did n't expect it to fill 45 up with water the first time i washed it by hand the water has since evaporated but i have n't tried to use the thermometer since and i wo n't use it without using a second one to calibrate this one to see if it is anywhere close to accurate not exactly what i was looking for
this is warm , beautiful , soft and a fabulous bargain ! i highly recommend it and buy the matching sheets ! they 're a wonderful combination
only had this coffee maker \( second replacement \) one year and it leaked from all over my counter i asked for a replacement , crazy huh , and was told no my time had run out well i am off on a hunt for a good coffee maker this was not it ! ! do not waste your money
amazon couldnt send me the correct cutting board and they tried 4 times and now they want me to review this item that they never sent m
these towels are soft and fluffy , but the towels are not absorbent just as other reviewers have stated , the towels do n't absorb water , rather the water rests on the surface of the towels
i bought it because of the rotisserie function , which i use a lot this model has no variable temperature control on that function there are some things i cook at a lower temperature for a longer time to get the proper doneness i do n't know why when they wired the machine they did n't route that function through the temperature control
i'm not sure who decided to put the word non stick in the title of this griddle it took me two days to scrape off the egg omelet that i tried to cook on it the first time they should change the title of this item to calphalon one stick 10 inch international griddle do not buy unless you enjoy hand cleaning and scraping pots and pans
this thermometer never worked correctly for oven temps over 350 the probe is worthless , it reads the oven temp , not the temp of the meat
this thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months , then the probe broke do n't ask me how it broke because i cannot see inside the metal do hicky a replacement probe is 10 15 provided you can find one
first , when you use the temperature probe , the meat temperature shows on the display also , it is very easy to set the temperature alarm however , there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm good for one burned roast granted , a mistake you will only make once
i was very unhappy with this product i ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use ! ! ! i did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner the people at foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under warranty but i am surprised to see how fragile this product is fyi , they will not warranty the products sold on e bay i should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product
i got one with my foodsaver i like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a couple of uses also the manufacture is not handy friendly i was injured and ca n't speak when i tried to get help by email they told me i needed to get friend or family member to call them if i wanted help that just wrong i guess they have n't heard about the equal access laws
it says this is a 2 burner grill pan but that is so wrong it does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners very dissapointing , i love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either hopefully they will come out with an updated one , until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues
made good waffles when i got it but now it burns them to a crisp
these tools , although fun looking , are poorly balanced and fall over if they do n't have enough room to rest on the counter the handles are a little awkward in size and the bowls of the spoons slightly too deep i like their look , but i do n't like the design of them
i wish i had this one goes to the goodwill grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular , like a chicken breast hamburgers work best watch out for burns
this was supposed to be the toaster to end all toasters
this is not a very good hot tea brewer the tea does n't steep hardly at all and there is no difference between the strength settings the water is also not heated to boiling it is really just a glorified coffee maker you would be better off purchasing a more traditional teapot for far less money
worked like a charm until i put it through the dishwasher , and now it always exudes a fine black residue maybe some kind of rust \? ca n't use it anymore unless i want black grime on my ice cream i have emailed the manufacturer to ask what 's going on have n't heard back yet
i bought a set recently and unfortunatley it is made in china we have some older ones and they are much differen
i recently ordered a pedrini black satin stainless steel tomato slicer through amazon com the delivery was very prompt
this is a complete waste of time this thing takes a lot longer than a traditional knife the tomato juice goes everywhere and its flimsy you actually have to saw and the blades bend like crazy dont waste your time or money
the blade broke after 14 months of use and to take advantage of the warranty , i learned that i was required to send them a check for 4 00 for processing costs , not to mention the cost that i would incurr to ship it to them it was an adequate grinder at best , so i'm definitely not going to bother returning it \( i assume that this is cuisinart 's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place \) i wonder if the rest of their product line is like this until now , i thought cuisinart was a name you could trust i'm very disappointed
i bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets i used it once without a problem , seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac the 2nd time i used it i was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box the 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working i turned the machine off , checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing i manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem , so i turned it back on it was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning i turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily , which lasted for at least 2 3 minutes before cooling off do n't waste your on this and more importantly do n't risk your safety with this fire trap
who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily \? since it does n't make any noise that it is boiling , you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing and what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways \? welding is a skill that if done right , it would not leak ! the handle will get hot so wear your glove on the plus side , the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place i use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable \( lasted 2 years \) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more , it do n't mean it would last longer mine start to leak after 4 months i am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it
this kettle has so many design flaws i do n't know where to start it does n't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back the spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup the shape \( especially the angle \) of the handle means that it gets very hot i ca n't hold it without a pot holder and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water mine also already started rust on the outside
look carefully at where the spout is mounted if you fill above this line , with the lid on tight , when it boils , boiling water shoots out of the spout and the lid fits so tight it is hard to remove without burning
i received the delonghi deep fryer on friday evening and had it at the post office on monday morning i did everything except stand on my head to get it to make potato chips smaller batches , larger batches , shorter cooking times , longer cooking times what i did get , consistantly , resembled more a potato cake which was soggy in the middle i bought a waring pro at william sonoma for 40 more and had beautiful potatos monday evening bottom line delonghi may be a bit cheaper and a tad easier to clean , but i want good tasting food
this board scratches really easily , and mine had dings in it when it arrived
i returned three incantos , all for the same reason the steamer stopped working on all of them after 3 4 weeks it sounded like the pump failed i replaced it with the slightly more expensive , older magic comfort plus , which has worked like a charm
this machine is the only sub 3000 machine i could find that would make a cappuccino with the push of one button however , after an hour of trying , i could not get the machine to do anything other than display a message saying the grind was too fine the delonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir , the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable i was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with , when the service person , after conferring with a colleague , decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that i should exchange it knowing that super automatics in general are not known for their reliability , i envisioned years of chronic problems with this machine i opted for a refund from amazon instead and am relieved i did
i bought one of your pans and i was so very careful with it only using plastic or wood utensils the pan has got big bubbles in it and the nonstick finish is pealing off i rate this very poor
please do your self a favor and do not buy this item as a toaster oven it burns the bottoms of everything you heat in it as a toaster to toast bread or bagels , well it still has yet to toast anything for us you can run the toaster 6 times and it will never toast brown i was shocked that this item would be so bad being that hamilton beach is a good brand
although i love the way it clips onto the oven rack , and it 's very easy to read , it took about 15 20 minutes to register the temperature of the oven
contrary to the description above , this is not a non stick pan i tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan everything stuck to the bottom i used bacon grease on the pan before i made the eggs they stuck i used butter on the pan before i made the pancakes they stuck
i ordered the orange and the red the colors were much more drab in person the cumin is actually burnt orange from the 70s
thought for years , i was missing something by not having a cuisinart ! what a laugh in the few months i have had this unit , two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken i did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using this is an obvious design defect guess i was lucky , in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything now they want the broken item returned , which is an inconvenience and a delay i was without my replacement last time , at least six weeks i plan to return this item and purchase a different brand
i had a russel hobbs electric kettle , made in the uk , which worked well for 3 years when it finally died , i ordered one of these , based on the glowing reviews it arrived new from amazon not working
maybe i just do n't understand what this is supposed to do kitchenaid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances but i have n't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment ca n't see that it does much more than a spoon , and certainly does n't do as much as a plain wire whisk it 's not portable like those cheap , little drink mixers when i'm at home , i have my immersion blender a much better option for mixing liquids maybe this is good for something i have n't tried yet
after 3 months of average use , this vaccuum stopped spinning the brushes the canister is difficult to empty i was very dissappointed because of the failure of this machine to last i will never buy a hoover product again
i love the colors and the heat resistance but found the wooden handle on one spatula rough and splintery also the spatula is showing nicks on the edges of the silicon don't understand because i don't use it on rough edged bowls or pans
it picked up great but one month before the warranty expired the thing made terrible noises and did n't self propel correctly sent it in for repair , took a month they said nothing was wrong and sent it back , but now it works i would n't buy another one for 300 it should last more than a year before repairs are needed
bought the vacuum on oct 1 2005 brought it back to the store on oct 7th the belt broke ! thought it was a fluke tried one more brought it back after 10 days a piece went flying after using the hose the suction on the hose then did not work ! overall the cleaning was great while it worked
i bought this vacuum new and used it three times for those three times , it worked like a dream never had the carpet been so clean it even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited
first of all i'm a dyson fanatic i have a total of three \( one on each floor \) when we bought our cabin i could n't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one \( they are pricey \) for carpet i'm on five or six times a year so i bought this at first i was thrilled it was wonderful after using it a few times however it has completely lost suction keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids , pets or real dirt i would doubt that it 's on except that it 's noisy and takes off without me i have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked also the dirt container is sometimes hard to remove and put back feels like it 's catching on something what a waste of money even in my college days i 've never had a worse vacuum i highly recommend the dyson instead or even the 50 dirt devil i gave my niece as a wedding present it cleans circles around this thing to me hoover spells disappoinment
this is the worst vacumm cleaner i have ever had ! it has continually broken down since i bought it and is now again dead it 's only 1 1 2 years old ! while under warranty \( the first year \) , i went through 5 belts , a roller brush , and the motor burned out it is no longer under warranty , and of course , it broke down again it smokes like it 's on fire , and i believe that it 's the roller brush again now mind you , my house is only 1600 sq ft , and half of that space is wood flooring , so i do n't have an excessive amount of carpet nor do i vacuum excessively maybe once a week i complained to hoover and they basically told me too bad and it 's not like it 's an inexpensive vacuum at 289 !
this one is does n't work when it gets hot or wet \( and where do you use your thermometer \? \)
mine worked reasonably well for about 7 months then stopped switching itself off and eventually overheated the plastic bulkhead which holds the coil , giving off a strong \( presumably toxic \) odour of melted plastic , also affecting the taste of the water amazon does not sell this item in britain , where it would never get through the safety tests required by consumer legislation , but apparently they are quite happy to put american lives in danger
i bought this item in october 2005 , by january it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher i contacted both amazon and emile henry about it amazon will only give a partial refund and emile henry told me to go through the merchant and did not offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product do n't buy this piece of junk
i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin , mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies
the tea kettle is inexpensive , but i 'd spend more to get a tea kettle that whistles and also has a top that flips open from the handle instead of one where you have to manually pop it off in addition , the handle gets hot , and you need an oven mitt to hold it
like many large wood surfaces , a peel is made from several strips of wood laminated together however , this peel developed a split after just one use the instructions indicate maintenance is achieved by wiping with mineral oil , so perhaps you should do this before using the first time i imagine there are heavier peels available which may be worth checking out
this mixer has many speed settings , but they all pretty much go the same speed the low setting is so fast that if you are mixing much liquid it spashes all over i would not recommend this mixer , spend a few more dollars and get a better one ! !
the glass is quite fragile i had two break
the breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states to get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14 15 minutes still faster than a fridge though also , the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs , no messy ice i thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using also , you still need to add water and the freezer packs do n't really last that long if you want to chill more than 1 bottle , i ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water also , if you are chilling allot of beverages , there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts they should put a drain spout at the bottom i had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink it does work being faster than your fridge or freezer , but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated
i tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm they say chill , but what does that really mean \? they should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes i guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work
the description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs i chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm i had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink gel packs do n't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine
it 's great , if it works ! ! ! after keep exchanging it over and over , i gave up the 5th time first time , spray did n't work , second time , power steam button did n't release the steam , third time , it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and i could n't clean the iron , fourth time , steam problem again , fifth time , steam problem again poorly tested product i would 've been really happy to keep it , if it was working properly it actually had all the features i was looking for too bad for rowenta for not testing their products properly
cast iron is the only way to go when you are cooking on anything over 30 , 000 btus lodge has a lock on this market trouble with this wok is the sides are not high enough as soon as you start mixing , your food goes sliding up and over the side also , for the extreme weight , the handle should be wider distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak hand hold i gave mine away after three months i wish they would change the design i 'd buy three
i bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like i used to the unit was not deffective or anything like that , but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small while it is stated in the manual that it 's not an a c unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation i found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective the fan at the back of the unit does n't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything while the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck i find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers overall , the unit just keeps your neck wet and does n't really cool anything i found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still anything over 85 degrees and it fails
i should have listened to the other reviewers , which i usually do i followed the directions to the letter put it on in 95 degree weather and never felt cool at all in fact , after several minutes i actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on even if it had worked , it was very uncomfortable i am suprised that sharper image sells such a bad product
very disappointed feels cumbersome around the neck and blows very little ai
first 5 minutes feels like having a cold towel on your neck
i live in new york city where the temperatures and humidity are high all this does is make your neck feel cold i was still sweating after an hour ! try it if you want the sharper image has a money back guarantee for 60 days i dont know about amazon
after one wash cycle , these sheets split at the seams otherwise soft and comfortable
i cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished roomba discovery 4210 while i think the product did a good job on bare floors \( not carpet \) , now after only 4 months of light use \( we only used in the kitchen den area of our home \) , the unit is trashed the refurb warranty is only 90 days and that 's apparently all the machine is good for i purchased a new aps fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out , but it did nothing this seems to be typical of this vacuum since the roomba rep i talked to told me that if the charger failed the roomba was probably trashed she was right if you want to try this machine stick with the new one , at least you 'll get a one year warranty but i recommend staying away altogether
roomba was given as a gift to me not only is it noisy , but it took 2 hours to do my small house with 3 rooms closed off to it \( about 1000 sq ft \) it takes me 15 minutes to swiffer the house it missed a lot of areas yuck
works well and looks great but lifting is not fun if you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle
i 've had this kettle for less than 2 years after reading good reviews , i decided to purchase this kettle because i wanted something that would last with daily use i disliked it from the beginning why \? 1 \) it 's heavy 2 \) when you open the lid to fill it with water \( you should n't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter \) , water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle 3 \) after less than 2 years of use , it is no longer working properly it constantly switches off during heating i 've had better use from a cheap plastic kettle , and will be going back to using one of those
what a joke ! ! ! this whas a disappointing experience the garment steamer never really worked i wasted a valuable time in this deal i bought one at target first missing parts then i went back returned it and came back home to use it and again never worked what a waste of my time ! the second garment steamer one and off button kept turning off about one minute never producing any steam i tried to contact customer service to find out if i was using it right and customer sevice is no help at all ! my advise is please don't even waste your time with it sincerely , amp 60 br amp 62 60 br 62
although i only hand washed these pots and pans , somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd year , the nonstick coating on the pans started lifting i also do not use metal cooking utensils
i purchesed this product not too long ago and whoever disigned it should take a look at the silverware basket they sould come up with a better way to drain the silverware because the silverware basket hangs over the counter in every position i tried needless to say , i took it back because the basket would have drained my silverware all over my counter and not in the drain board i think its a nice dish rack but the basket has to be redisigned to drain in the drain board and not over the counter looks are very decieving , in the picture it looks like the basket is over the drain board but its not i hope this helps others before they decide to buy this product
i ordered 2 sets of four in case there was any breakage and guess what 1 ramekin was broken leaving me with 7 dishes to top it off , a few days later , i found a comparable set , slightly larger , at big lots , for only 7 for four of course this is always the risk we take through mail order often it is not worth the time or trouble to get refunds or replacements
we had to return this item for a refund it arrived and never worked
the first time i used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken i thought that it was my technique after reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter , i tried another batch using the rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter the results were the same no thickening , just liquid
i get this thing and they forget to tell you about the big bulky power cord its impossible to feed the fish and a number of other problems
i purchased the melitta mill in april , it 's now july and the thing is shot we used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee , first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing sure it was inexpensive , but you should get more than three months out of the purchase 6 a month just to grind coffee \? do n't buy this poorly constructed product
i received this grinder because i had purchased a defective melitta grind brew coffee maker through amazon the coffee maker had electrical problems and i sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed to make a very long story short melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker they stopped making them amazon had my money and i waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker amazon would not help me and after many , many phone calls melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the brew and grind grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months warning don't buy melitta products and returns for defective merchandise should be returned to amazon
i , too , am so disappointed with this product when our delonghi toaster oven died after 15 years , my husband and i went shopping for a new one numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that delonghi toaster ovens just were n't as good as they used to be , so we decided to try the kitchenaid oven it appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we 'd always been satisfied with the oven , which was bought from a major retailer , looked fine , but the timer and bell were out of synch even worse , while the top coils heated up nicely , the bottom ones heated very unevenly kitchenaid customer service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense less than a week later the new oven arrived it looked perfect but again , it did n't work this time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up after preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner 's manual , we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom now we 'll have to return this oven as well , and we 've pretty much given up on getting a kitchenaid one at all
the product is labeled as a seed grinder , so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds , but it failed miserably i tried grinding flax seeds \( about the size of sesame seeds \) but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact i even tried running the ground seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds that was with the grinder on the fine setting it seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts the grinding wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been ground by the wheels if you 're wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds , try a manual grinder if you 're wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds , spend more money and get a proper flour mill
the decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish i was thrilled i have been looking all over to find one that size in glass i was so mad and disappointed when i opened the box and it was 8 5 x 4 5 that was n't what i ordered and yes when baking bread there is a difference i am still waiting on my postage paid return label so i can ship this back this would have been a great deal , except i already have the 8 5 x 4 5 pans they need to change the dimensions in the description buyer beware !
we bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped we looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task
no i do n't think it 's the problem with my washer and dryer , they are new units now only with great difficulty can i put them on my queen bed and they claim they have deep pockets ! i do believe it is a quality problem
i was so happy when i received this sheet set it looks beautiful \( that 's the reason why i am still giving 1 star \) but after a couple of nights of use the fitted sheet became ruff they pile ! ! ! ! if you are looking for comfort as anybody who buys a 1000tc sheet set is do n't bather with these spend your hard earned money someplace else
i'm normally a fan of oxo products and own many of their gadgets these measuring cups are the first problem product i 've had from oxo both the 2 cup and 4 cup sizes cracked on the bottom of the cup , right at the plastic injection point \( that little circle with the tiny bump in the center of it \) , and they both now leak at the crack these cracks developed very soon after i bought them , and i only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher because of the design of the cups , it 's kinda annoying to wash them by hand and they 're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason so mine have gone into the garbage can , replaced by the kitchenaid cups of similar appearance \( although without the handy interior measuring marks \) my advice , keep your receipt if you buy these or skip them and get the kitchenaid , which have a non slip rubber ring on the bottom , another nice feature and they wo n't crack in the dishwasher
i have bought flannel sheets from amazon before but they were from martex and they were greate but , these are just bad they are too thin to start with , left lint all over the bed and even after washing they have left fuzzies all over the sheets , i cannot even explain how bad it is i should have waited for another martex deal
product not even worth a penny impossible to use after the first wash wont recommend to anyon
i bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping , despite the low reviews \( i plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season \) when i took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it amazon replaced them , but when i washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart the filled up the lint collector i have red and green lint everywhere , even after washing them you get what you pay for
very , very , disappointed and irritated humbug , i ordered this rice cooker and i just received it today i really wish , i had read some of the reviews above the description on this site clearly states that the rice cooker stays warm for 5 hours !
i have depended on my french white the old style for many years i went to buy a few new pieces for myself , but discovered that corning has changed the design french white is now nothing more than cheap cheesy heavy porous breakable stoneware i saw many chips and even a crack in the display models stupid corning ! they seem to have forgotten that corningware was designed to be the smart alternative to that cheap cheesy heavy porous breakable stoneware ! please save your
i have tried to like this pot in theory it sounds great , but in actual usage , it is very problematic the non locking handles are the chief drawback you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me
although i ordered the juicer in the color black , i received the product in white if not for the color i would have purchased it locally after approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off i had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years i am obviously totally disappointed
i thought i was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor i used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and i ended up with oil water from condensation dripping down the side i returned the product and received a full refund the safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people
it simply does n't do the job only bruises the herbs i normally love oxo products , but this one is a disappointment
i loved this when i purchased it , then i noticed it did not do a perfect job , then it would take a while to get going , then it smoked and died not worth it
i purchased a few of these for myself and friends from the day i got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool , especially since i could use it when making sauces or frying onions and veggies one day when making a non meat tomato sauce the handle simply broke off leaving the handle in my hand and the spatula in the pot i wrote to oxo about this twice in the last 2 months with no reply and this is most frustrating to me anyway , i am now using a kitchenaid product which feels much more sturdy and kitchenaid responds to e mails immediately
the very first cut i made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface subsequent cuts also left deep marks for something that 's advertised as being harder than maple , i found this to be very surprising maybe it 's the way it 's put together \? all i know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen pretty much the only thing that i like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource good thing because at the current rate , i anticipate needing a new one very soon
i have the large one tried to use it on coffee ca n't get it to work love the rest of the products
i decided to buy this riedel sommeliers bordeaux grand cru and burgundy glasses from amazon due to the the price and the name when they arrived both were damaged i returned them and wait for the replacements when i got it , surprise surprise , they were all damaged again and amazon said that they wo n't replace them anymore and i needed to return them again for the refund ! ! ! the worst experience in online shopping ever ! ! !
i returned it without even using it because it did not feel like a quaility item i would not recomend this product if you have any taste
like most reviewers , i found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist like a number of other reviewers , i found that one of my glasses leaked unlike one other reviewer , i was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave , and when i tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced to my mind , elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design 5 stars for form , 1 star for function 2 stars total
i got this pasta maker as a gift , and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers all it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness the company is going to charge me to send it to them and back , even if they decide to exchange the product , and all correspondences must be done by mail \( no call in number \) so i'm not even hopeful for an exchange
bought the machine , and got the correct flour made up the dough , and that was a success followed the instructions , used the vice to hold the machine to the table , then started off by cleaning the machine with a small piece of dough to get rid of machine oil
we purchased this corkscrew as a gift for our daughter on her first attempt to use it at a holiday dinner party , we found that it required an unreasonable amount of strenghth to uncork a bottle of wine
does n't work not worth the postage to return the foil cutter works , though so if you want a really expensive foil cutter with a free paper weight , this is for you !
i have to admit that this is not as handy as i hoped it is big and clumsy and it 's a little too flexable
after me first coffeemaker began leaking and it was a realtively new proctor silex 12 cup maker i decided to try one of these cute single serve ones why , oh why did i purchase this brand \? \? first , it does take around 3 4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea this seems like a longer time than most and now , after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks , it 's leaking just like the old one did not user error , as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker also , the coffee is not coming out as hot either , which causes me to wonder if it 's the heating element even though this one can use loose grounds or pods , it is not worth the frustration ! try a different brand my sister in law has really enjoyed her sensao !
absolutely horrible ! the worst 20 i 've every spent this machine is an absolute waste of money i have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it , they are all either too wide or too tall a total headache when your rushing out to work
when something says 'white' i sort of expect to get something close to the colour white i ordered three of these plates but they are closer to beige they also have an odd matte finish that made them seem cheaply however , they are large plates and at this price , probably good for entertaining if you need quite a few the large ones would be good for holiday meals those times when you really need extra serving pieces that you do n't use the rest of the year
the tumbler that i have is sold in various places as the '360 degree dribble proof tumbler' , i am not sure if that is the same as the jmt401 but on paper the specs and features are the same it is not a good design for car use on the plus side i like the no handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders on the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed also the 'dribble proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip , and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing
looks great in my kitchen but i , too , only use it for shakes smoothies it does smell like burning rubber nearly every time i used to think something was wrong with it and now i just disregard it and after less than two years or making smoothies , i'm replacing the blade gasket assembly
we have owned this blender for about 3 years if i had to do it again i definitely would not buy this blender first , it is very loud the timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty the only things i like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big other than that do n't waste your time
this is our fourth new blender in the last three years my wife and i prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice , but lots of frozen berries , fresh fruit , etc nothing else goes in the blender this blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality it even worked great for a few months then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off now it is out of warranty this is not simple to replace since the plastic rubber piece separated from the steel shaft we paid close to 100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge 25 50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad
it leaked from the bottom seam the first time i used it but i guess you get what you pay for
this was the single worst set i 've ever used if zero stars would be an option , that 's what i would have chosen the pot broke before we could even dunk a peice of bread into the cheese while it was warming on the stand it came with , i heard a sickening crack , so i immediately \( tried \) to take it the pot off the stand the entire bottom of the pot and split away from the side and cheese oozed everywhere on my counter top
this item was broken when it was received it was not packed properly
it 's not made in germany that 's for sure , it 's made in china \( like everything nowdays \) and i was really looking for german quality
oxo usually makes great things , this sifter does the job , but if you 're making something large be prepared to be there awhile it 's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire i would not recommend this sifter , just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies
i have never written an online review for a product before , but i am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that i just had to i am not a speed baker of any sort , but i have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes , muffins , cookies , etc my old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour , so i started looking for a new one i chose this one after reading all the online reviews , and even though i saw that a few people found it slow , i was not prepared for how slow it really is ! i just sifted 3 cups of confectioner 's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes as another reviewer said , in order to make it go faster i shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired \( i have never ever been tired out from baking before , fer' pete 's sake ! ! ! \) i'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually used a sifter i'm stuck with the thing now , i suppose , so i 'll learn to just go slower but it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side the one thing i really like is the caps for both ends an innovation i'm surprised nobody else has come up with but that does n't redeem the product for me in fact , if i can put my hands on another one of those old fashioned ones \( at a thrift store , maybe \) i 'll snap it up and put this new one in the goodwill bin
amazon should discontinue sale of this item as replacement batteries are not readily available
after using this product twice i was extremly disapointed
i purchased this item from a well known home shopping tv show after 4 months , it 's no longer working also , it is advertised as being able to be put into the diswasher i have an average size diswasher and it does not fit ! ! i have contacted the manufacturer and will return it for repair or replacement !
item was not the one ordered , i returned it and the reolacement you sent was also incorrect i returned this second item for credit you had placed your sticker with bar code over the manufacture 's bar code and your label was incorrect i hope you correct your error before you send several custmers the wrong ite
i bake a lot of cookies i love my mixer but and concerned and disappointed in this piece of equipment it peels and chips constantly and those pieces of plastic paint mysteriously disappear into \? \? \? \? \? \? \? how can they sell this type of faulty equipment
i bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that i had previously owned the powerbrush just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time the prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier
there 's hardly any suction i applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet \( which requires a little effort one squirt at a time \) , but it only sucked up a few drops of it customer service was helpful and had me return the product
the slow cooker worked well the first time i used it the second time , the light turned on , but it never heated up i was disappointed , because the size was perfect for me i 'll try another brand
i have had these for about 4 months \( i own every size made \) , purchased to go with the other kitchenaid pieces \( in red \) it is impossible to get these white again after using them to cut cheese , carrots or anything with any natural coloring in it i have tried cleansers with bleach , sprays with bleach and , in desperation , straight bleach ! scrubbing does n't work either i finally got some wood cutting boards and wish i still had my so attractive other ones on the counter
i'm surprised you requested this review because i returned the item they
i bought a haier rtc1700ss oven from amazon about a month ago i am still waiting for a replacement from haier because the trays spit did not fit
i bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly i called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange i was under the impression they would send it out but when i called , i was told i was supposed to send in 14 95 for shipping or i could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when i returned it the new unit i received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again i just used a manual timer it baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans i just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in , including the oven but i doubt i will reorder this product too unpredictible
beautiful to look at , but , i agree with other reviewers that buttons are difficult to operate and do n't even work sometimes , plus be prepared to change batteries every few months ridiculous for something that uses two lithium batteries and is not in heavy , or even everyday use
i have this scraper and after just a few uses , it fell apart at the connection in the center normally , i rave about kitchenaid , but this product was truly a disappointment
i have several other silicone spatulas , and this kitchenaid scraper is , by far , the worst i 've used most silicone scrapers are soft and flexible , but this one is very stiff and rigid , so you cannot scrape containers out very well at all honestly , it does n't even appear to be made of silicone cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one very disappointing
when this arrived i was very pleased with its quality color packaging everything only problems is that after a short time using the plates i noticed scratch marks dark ones in the center of the plates i would guess from where people used their dinner knives to cut their food very disappointing as i was ready to buy the entire collection glad i waited
i bought this because it had such good reviews i got one and used it a few times perfectly without problems until it blew up in the microwave yep , blew up now im sure i did everything as i was meant to so i really am being objective about this review
i found this product cumbersome , and the instructions for assembly , battery replacement , etc were not very clear the vacuum did n't hold a charge well , and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement i finally gave up altogether and bought a different product
i bought this and some other pans in the set very disappointed i have a glass cooktop , and when the pans heat up , they warp then return to their normal shape when they cool down guess i got what i paid for
the battery is way below standard , extremely disappointing it 's cheaper to buy another machine than to replace it
this product stands up to heavy use without fraying or melting my only complaint , and it 's a significant one , is the shape of the handle i find it awkward and clunky it 's probably great for people with larger hands i 've decided to replace mine with cheaper ones
the handle is big , bulky and heavier than need be it 's like picking up a hammer
i must begin by saying my kitchen is 100 kitchenaid in empire red i adore their gadgets and utencils and then i came across this egg slicer
i bought one of these because i think that the idea of a slicer is good supposed to work with soft cheese , eggs , mushrooms and other soft items
buyer beware ! i agree with the other reviews , these plates are beautiful ! great size and shape however , i used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak , espresso stained table ! each place a cup or plate was set that was n't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind if you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine , but i would n't ever put them on a quality wood table again fortunately amazon makes returning easy
we like the features and performance of this oven quite a bit we bought it to replace a regular old toaster oven the t fal toasts very evenly and i can fit a whole frozen pizza in it !
this brews great coffee unfortunately i have gone through 2 of these in 3 years not heavy use either on my first one it started to leak the water from the bottom , and now my second one does n't grind anymore still makes a good hot cup of coffee thou
my knives started to rust after 3wks of use i did n't put them in the dishwasher either i just leave them in the sink w the dirty dishes till i'm ready to wash but that should n't be the problem i have a cheap 3 butcher 's knife from chinatown that has n't rusted yet and i treat that one the same
i used this dough blender for not even 6 months , and the handle snapped ! \( mind you , i am not a pastry chef , so i was not using it everyday i used it a handful of times \) i understand it has a 5 year warrenty , so i will try to get it replaced i have to say that it worked great before it broke
i am an avid cook and baker i used this unit twice and it broke after the 2nd useage i found it to be very slow the charge did n't last long so i had to keep it plugged in the dough had to be very very soft in order for the press to produce the cookies i am very disappointed that such an expensive item would operate so poorly
i was really looking forward to receiving this , but four weeks after purchasing online , i received an email from amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase ! i am disappointed in amazon how can you sell something you do not have
i have to echo some of the other customers' negative sentiments below this thing never really worked well recently i noticed it had completely died i think i used it all of 6 times there have to be better models out there i would n't recommend this one
my rack came with pieces warped , one screw and most screw holes missing wood split as i was putting it together used it once for drying pasta , then once for kindling hope you have better luck
this blender is very weak it has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and i had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up just the bottom part of the mix spins around i used this blender four times since august 2006 \( when i bought it \) to make 'smoothies' , always with poor results as the other reviewer said , the fruit stays lumpy the little blades are n't strong enough yesterday i wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup of course they are thick and starchy , but after the usual 'stirring' to get them to move through the blender , the speed buttons started to vibrate and i could smell the unit getting hot i was n't overworking it mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds all of a sudden , it would n't work any more it just burned out if you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things , do n't buy this blender i'm going to see if amazon will take it back \( note after i wrote this , i was told by amazon that i had to get in touch with the manufacturer , which i could do because it was within 90 days of purchase however , the company wants me to mail in the plug and 5 for 'shipping' to get a replacement , which obviously i do n't want why would i want to pay 5 more for a product that did n't work the first time \? why would i want the product again at all \? amazon would have taken it back , but they wanted it returned in the box , which i threw out i'm even more dissatisfied with this product now than when i wrote this review originally maybe i can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair
i suppose this will actually peel garlic , if you use it just right never , ever , ever get it wet it will not work also , you must trim off both ends of the garlic , or it wo n't peel and then , i still have to hand peel some of the more stubborn pieces it 's just not worth the money if you look around , you can find much cheaper garlic peelers out there buy them !
owned four diffrent styles all of them worked ok but ! ! ! the pitchers cracked , all of them ! ! ! ! my last new mr coffee pitchers lasted 3 months and cracked \( tea went all over the counter and floor \) if you just make tea once in a while it may be ok but i make 3 pitcher 's a day with three tea makers sitting in the kithen on a old compter desk the hamilton beach has lasted 5 years with only one pitcher , it works good i'm ordering 2 more to replace the 2 mr coffee because all my pitchers cracked i know most people do n't drink that much , but i do
i bought this teapot from amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times the material is great , heat retention is good , it looks very nice , and i had no problems cleaning it \( i use a babybottle brush \)
yes , it is pretty no , it is not a good teapot i have made tea for over 40 years , in all sorts of pots , and this is right up there with the worst it drips a lot ! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout and no , it does not drip from the spout rather , lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot this happens with both fast and slow pouring , with full and near empty pots this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot just too much mopping up
this is not aubergine , a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin , but it is a light , bright purple sitting on my kitchen countertop , it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning glowing , shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting caveat emptor , unless you 're color blind or really like bright purple
we love this machine , but it continually breaks down the plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them we have waited many times for parts , and we have waited too long on the service line needing help
i sent it back because the shaft that was supposed to fit down through a hole didn't , no matter how i considered the matter , so never tried it , sent it back , asked for a refund \(
took what i thought would be a nice set of sheets to my place in costa rica and have slept in wrinkles ever since hard to maintain , color is not vivid and am overall disappointed with this 600 thread count sheet set
you can buy this at walmart for 78 00 the seller here is charging 89 00 plus 26 00 shipping you can buy here for 115 00 or go to walmart and get it for 78 00
i thought kitchenaid this has to be a keeper i was wrong the handles are much too heavy there 's too much give with the spatulas i find the utensils to be too bulky and uncomfortable i 'll stick to my other much cheaper temperature regulated utensils
i bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago it turned out to be more work than just a regular box at least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears it gets to be a disgusting affair , more than with a regular box
the professional label on this product is a big misnomer
i had been looking for egg rings \( without knowing what such a thing was actually called \) for a long time before i happened upon these babies as soon as i saw them i knew they were exactly what i had been looking for and ordered them on the spot unfortunately , my glee turned sour when i tried to use my new egg rings
well , it started off a fairytale this small vacuum has a lot of power unfortunatley , i think i have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum it is extremely loud , it terrified my pets and i had ringing in my ears after using it it worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me i'm not sure if the motor gave out or what , but the suction does n't work even though the brushes still spin the filter is a pain ! i run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair , it just clogs up way to fast if you have a small apartment with merely area rugs , this might be ok , just make sure you buy some ear plugs yikes
this egg slicer would seem to be a smart design since it will do slices and wedges however , the wires consistently get snagged in the slots and break also , it does not accomodate jumbo eggs well
the way specifications were mentioned it sounded a good deal , and price comparision made it more real , but after getting the item i found that it 's true low price , low quality do n't fall for this deal i am disappointed
this product is junk i like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed the hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight my second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out do not buy this product ! ! !
i 've used these type of units all the time until i got my own it stopped sealing , and i have n't had a chance to use up the bags that came with it ! when i called , they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they ca n't fix it they offered to sell me a new one though ! i have no idea where my receipt is \( my fault \) i have to have another one , so i'm going to buy the cheapest one so i do n't feel so bad when i have to replace it in 6 months to a year
when i received my set of mini springform pans i was very excited i could n't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts and as expected the results were great only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves not only did i notice rust on the release hinges , but the rims on the collars were warped at first i thought i could live with this , but a friend pointed out it could only get worse i am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment , but these definitely do not make the grade admitedly the results of my first time use were great , but i just do n't feel these pans will last i hate buying something and knowing i will have to replace it soon and that is exactly the way i felt with these pans
i purchased this after looking at all of the reviews what a mistake ! after using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice , there was one thing in common a huge mess even after rinsing the raw rice several times , the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius i may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess , or i may just stick it in the basement and forget about it
this carafe keeps beverages warm enough the problem i'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position the instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue , although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid despite following these instructions the push button still sticks to get the lid to close now after i'm done pouring i have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe very poor design in my opinion i would n't buy another zojirushi product based on this experience
simply put , it does n't work well , perhaps it can work on some types of fabrics garments in very specific \( or limited \) situations , but it did n't work on mine
i have purchased this item twice the first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty the grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire there is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it the same is true of all brands models sold as wireless are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire that said , before it becomes useless , it works really well maybe the idea is to buy these by the case \?
i 've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great but inevitably the probes fail you will think its your fault and probably buy a new one but the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven
while it worked , it worked great but then it stopped working only 10 months of use ordered a new probe , but that did n't work now , it 's just an expensive timer would 've received three stars , but the polder site and service not helpful will try the taylor model , good luck with analog taylor thermometers once you get used to these types of thermometers , it 's hard to go back the precision in cooking , especially for chicken and pork , can make a big difference
i purchased this wok for my husband 's christmas present it was lovely , we cooked two meals in it christmas day nice heat transfer , beautiful on the table \( but big \) that night , he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan it 's considerably narrower than the normal le creuset handle back it went to williams sonoma , where there were a few other l c woks with similar cracks ! phooey to you , le creuset
we received 3 sets of this for a wedding present i really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand however , after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots after two more washes the rust got worse these are supposed to be dishwasher safe ! there are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them , but who has the time for that these days \? despite the apeal of the set , we decided to try something else it 's a shame because it 's such a pretty set \( before the wash of course ! \)
i bought two sets of these about 4 months ago after the first time in the dishwasher i noticed little tarnish rusty looking spots they rubbed off fairly easily , but as time has gone by , they are looking very bad tonight while eating , i got a sliver in my finger from the fork ! i have never had a piece of flatware peel i'm going back to my old flatware sure glad i saved it ! don't buy this junk
true , these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash , however , that is n't my concern
this press does n't seem to work well the top browns much more quickly than the bottom clean up is n't all that easy i was surprised by how small the grill surface was
we had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day within a month the machine broke keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well \( a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem ! ! \) they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going the coffee was good but the tea was not most importantly people is it is wasteful with little plastic cups filling up the garbage , and in our case two machines in the dump come on people lets have some conscious comsumerism and slow down what ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you if you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans
i bought this pan because it was non stick , plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel i bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan it stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans it was not easy to get it off , i had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle definitely not non stick the air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning , which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie , which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together
we just replaced our entire kitchen dishware with the sango brown mistake even bought the added pieces well , we only hand wash them \( we have a dishwasher but rarely use it \) in the first week , a plate broke in half right down the middle then a week later , a second and tonight , a third all three directly down the middle of the plate while hand washing \( not rough washing either \) i have a call into sango and hopefully they will resolve it after reading the reviews here , i would have to agree that its not worth the danger of broken dishes \( my wife sliced her finger pretty good on the second broken one \) to buy these i am going to try to find a set that will go with all the extras i bought from sango i am hoping i do n't have to replace everything ! what a mess ! sango , why cut corners on such a beautiful set \? \? im at a loss here to figure out that business logic
i was disappointed with the spatula it is too flexible and too large for my hand my husband thought the size was okay but he too thought it was too flexible it reminded me of a diving board
these sheets are not quality they are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them the jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior they are not a bargain
i agree these sheets are horrible i should have know better i have the same issues as every one else does i dont know what will happen after the second wash they will proably fit the crib
i wish it was possible to give less than 1 star ! went through dishwasher once , came out rust ! save your money or your packaging ! i thought chicago cutlery how can i go wrong \? so out the packaging went ! i called chicago cutlery turns out some of their stuff is now made in china would n't that make it china cutlery \?
i was very pleased with the le creuset baking dishes i have \( i have the poterie 10 x 13 deep dish baker , 14 oval baker , and 9 square dishes as well as this one \) however , my 12 dish just cracked down the middle while i was cooking a pork roast in it at 425 degrees it had only been in the oven about 45 minutes i am sorely disappointed and now i am wondering if i wasted my money on the others i have only had it for about 2 1 2 months
i have owned this breadman for one year i make between one and two loafs of bread per week mostly whole wheat bread i purchased the 900s because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well \( 8 years \)
not sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this , but i certainly could not i made three attempts , all failures for various reasons either it did not mix , or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base , or it created pebbles of dough it definitely can not be left unattended , which defeats the purpose of delay start it bakes ok though , but you better do all the upfront work yourself ps i was using the recipes that come with the maker
we liked the idea that the caraffe did n't need to be heated from below a big plus with this unit but we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter a flood of coffee we thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them but then we had a flood again on the counter so we thought that maybe our filters were'nt good so we bought other ones and them we had another big flood of coffee \( this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting \) so we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight so we ground it coarser and yet , another dang flood we have followed the instructions perfectly and still these overflows
from the start , it was apparent that the temperature displayed was 5 or 6 degrees higher than two other digital thermometers i had in the same room so i followed the calibration instructions and was only able to get the display to read 34 1 degrees in a 32 degree solution ok , so i can live with 2 1 degree inaccuracy after calibrating , the room temperature was also only off by about 2 degrees however , i decided to test it in boiling water and the display read 193 degrees \( water boils at 212f \) so , if you are counting on this thermometer to tell you anything important \( such as if your meat is cooked suffiently or if your beer water is the right temperature for steeping \) , i would make sure it is accurate at the temperature of interest before using or avoid it all together , which i wish i had done
in defense of amazon com , the pan was not damaged during shipping it appears that the nonstick surface has been gouged on both pans i just got a refund poor quality do n't waste your time
i wish i 'd read the previous reviews ! i ordered this for 14 99 as a bottom of the page special and it 's going back it is not two inches thick as described , but 3 4 what a disappointment ! and now i see that the regular price has been changed from 25 to 40 yikes ! do n't bother
all four glasses arrived broken they are not packed for shipment i have tried three times to get amazon to refund my money but i have had no luck heed the warnings
now , i love the idea of having a chrome tub caddy until 2 months into having it , it begain to rust then the candle holder the wine glass holder rusted off ! ! ! i am now on the looking out for a plastic covered tub caddy a caddy is awesome to have but not in chrome ! !
i bought three of these when i saw them in a local store , thinking them a great deal they look like the equivalent of the henckels , solid and sturdy , at one fifth the price looks can be deceiving they are suitable for paper , skin , aluminum foil , etc , but do not try them on anything more substantial , like chicken leg bones i broke these on items that i routinely cut through with my henckels and wusthof shears the cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost , so i tossed out all three pairs
this product is sick ! if you get a delight out of seeing an fish hung like a christmas decoration in a ball that is way too small too live in your sick ! plus a nightlight \? try sleeping w no eyelids w a light over your head fish sleep too , but they cant close their eyes there does not even seem to be much air space above the water it 's the same problem with those silly bowls with the plants on top they breath oxygen and sufficate witout fresh air get at least a five gal tank and do n't waste your on this cheap fad product bettas are so smart , fun and sociable and desarve just as much respect as all of our fellow pets and humans
this mixer is so weak it could n't mix air it 's horribly under powered seriously , it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes , and i'm talking instant mashed potatoes ! and mix protein drinks \? \? forget about it it leaves clumps because it does n't spin fast enough i 'd do better twirling my finger in the glass
i agree with the other reviewers had the machine for a couple weeks , after 5 uses the machine did n't sit right on the base , causing the teeth between the base and the container to grind a bit after that , it was all downhill the base teeth were completely ground down within 2 uses interestingly , the new back to basics smoothie machines seem to have a better locking mechanism , and teeth that seem to be made of more durabe material
i had this machine for about 3 years with no issues but , how often do most people use their machine \? i used it maybe 15 to 20 times i went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden i see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell \( we all know what that smell means \) the plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita 's were everywhere \( except in my glass \) we had to throw the whole machine out now i will be buying a new machine , being that i enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if i ca n't find one thats non plastic i will use my blender the smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks , a blender always doesnt pour as nice i will not buy another plastic model again \( i believe this one was a gift to me \) do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists , obviously the motor does n't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews i 've read
i bought the back to basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos i was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke it is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug i was very disappointed since i use it every morning but thought it would last longer i will look for a better quality one next time
i am a quilter and was looking for a good hot iron and lots of steam i also hate the auto shut off well i thought i had found it the perfect iron for my needs well after only one days use it is put away for someone else to use i was very disapointed in the iron it spits water and boy do i mean spit my ironing board cover was wet my fabric continued to to roll under the iron , the surface is not smooth and seems to grap the fabric not what i was looking for at all i would not recommend this iron
i have had this iron for awhile now the big problem is that gunk builds up on the soleplate that is almost impossible to get off except when you iron white shirts , when it seems to rub off of the collar and seams , permanently staining and thus ruining your shirts avoid this iron at all costs
i was very disappointed with the cookie maker plus and i believe i bought a defective product the picture on the front of the box shows the person 's hand on the big button to make cookies , i had to use the small button at the top to get it to work and the big button to retract the plunger i have used the cookie maker plus 4 times twice to make twice baked potatoes , once to make candy but the 4th time i used their recipe for classic spritz cookies the machine died after 16 cookies i switched the batteries and it produced 2 more cookies , then died again i finished the batch by rolling them out and using a cookie cutter the cookie master plus could use major inprovement do n't waste your money
