sphere by michael crichton is an excellant novel this was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the crichton novels that i have read
dr oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation he describes how he combines complementary medicine \( e g hypnosis , reflexology , yoga , message , acupuncture etc \) with orthodox western medicine there is an excellent forward by dr dean ornish , and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques the bulk of the book contains stories of patients dr oz treated using this revolutionary way i am a cardiologist , and i have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine , which is the reason i bought this book however this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment nevertheless , those interested in this new medicine , which i think will be the medicine of the new millennium , will want to read this book
the most gorgeous artwork in comic books contains the most extraordinary artwork of alex ross \( superman , batman , wonder woman , the justice league , etc , even hanna barbera ! \) a comics fan , i recieved this as a christmas gift , and i read it again and again
this book is for lovers of robicheaux his demons seem put to rest , redemption seems almost within his grasp and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages the poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade burke 's prose as always , but his anger at humanity 's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface hurricane katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing a bit like robicheaux himsel
this is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length i want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful , engaging and thought provoking story
since i am a world 's fair fanatic i have read almost everything that i can on the subject in general , this is an interesting and well researched book the author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about however , i must point up three rather glaring errors in the book in describing the louisiana world expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be 80 feet tall , just 150 feet shorter than the eiffel tower since the eiffel tower is actually over 900 feet tall , the new orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall this may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time the other error states that the us pavilion at the brussels world 's fair of 1958 was a large , squat , round concrete block structure it was indeed large and round , but not squat and not made of concrete blocks according to the excellent book about edward durrell stone , the architect of the pavilion , the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light i have seen photos of the us pavilion , and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me \( in comparison to the soviet pavilion , which resembled a large refrigerator ! \) thirdly , the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the u s s r exhibited at a u s expo they had a large pavilion at the new york world 's fair of 1939 all in all , however , i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world 's fairs
this the one book that taught me more about how to use my slr than the camera 's manual itself the step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography i also liked the way mr frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter one take without the filter and then the same one with a filter also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field an encompassing book , the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment the peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown a good buy and money well spent my only gripe is that i preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
tom friedman is a engaging writer he also writes from a very personal perspective , both as to how the world has changed for him and his family , and for his friends around the world you get the feeling that mr friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching what a treat and a very easy read pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the us shores
john crowley 's well deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the english language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980 's his great work of time is an intriguing rashomon esque time travel fantasy about cecil rhodes and british economic imperialism in east africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries it was almost as compelling a read as the the nightingale sings at night , which offers a fantastical twist on the adam and eve creation myth saga the other two tales , in blue and novelty , i found much less compelling , but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose crowley uses in other tales it was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library a surprise which i think many readers will also discover
this story captivated me right from the outset , as vivian copes with age related loss of memory her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail , and she is a very realistically portrayed
i found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk i visit at least once every summer i love going there and looking to see if i can find a book that i have never heard of , by an author i 've never heard of , and buy it on a whim this is the novel i bought last year i has , unfortunately , sat on my shelf since then until tonight , because of many reasons tonight , however , i picked it up and read it cover to cover the narrative was brilliantly told , the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching if i had made it to the end without some tears , i would believe myself made of stone !
i checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as i cracked it open i knew i needed a copy of my own it is full of simple , tasty , and easy to prepare recipes i really like how most of the recipes do n't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are i was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence i 'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine
i sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america in absolute awe ! with almost 200 contributors , almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations , editor andy smith and oxford university press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken whether you are a food professional or interested amateur , a historian , sociologist or anthropologist , a student or scholar , these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in america the scope is astounding , spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products , from ethnic , religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in american history , and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in america despite the enormity of this work , it is refreshingly approachable , set forth alphabetically , written in clear language , translated when needed , and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further as a food professional recipe developer , food writer and culinary educator there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive
i borrowed this book on cd from the library and half way through , ordered the book so i would have it to refer to excellent book , highly recommended helps to put a realistic perspective on millionaires
i saw the 1963 classic first , which happens to be one of my most favourite ghost movies of all time ! \( what a major disappointment the remake was \) so as soon as i could a got a copy of this it was an awesome novellete i read it in one sitting , could n't put it down ! i do have to say i enjoyed the movie better but this is a great journey as well
while expertly crafted , this is not a pretty novel , nor is it gentle the subject matter abduction of a child is somber , as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying the plot twists and turns , as befits a lehane novel , and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying but you can usually trust lehane to take good care of you in this , one of his finer books and not only are there plot twists to wrestle with , there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head all in all , this was a solid , enjoyable thriller the reader will feel his time was not wasted
awesome this book is worth its weight in gold for the insights and understanding it shares with a professional background in finance , economics and a profound study of the word of god , the author is well qualified to expose mammon for what it is , and to challenge the reader to a deeper surrender to the only real treasure worth having buy two and give a copy away can we have a new edition please
this book does something i 've never seen before it shows a cool young homo boy who 's punk rock and a skater , not some wishwashy queen boy sam , the lead character , is really cool i 'd like to be his friend , and his boyfriend , but that 's another matter also , the dude he likes , clay , is really hot he 's a surfer , but he 's not a stereotypical surfer , he 's much cooler , and also a little punk rock i love this novel the ending is really sad , but i loved it
fear nothing is about christopher snow , whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways , but chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is , and even that his little town of moonlight bay is stranger , and scarier , than he thought chris then sets out with his friends , and his dog , to find out the truth about what 's really going on
i'm not even a vegetarian , let alone a vegan , and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait ! unless you hate veggies , this book is a must have ! i just made the herb scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right , it 's hard to believe there 's no cheese or cream ! the pizza with caramelized onions , kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too ! lots of yummyness
very good , easy , light funny read ! although his best , by far , in my opinion was running with scissors this was an enjoyable read would recommend reading his work if you like david sedaris , both have a similiar style
reading this book is like having a holy vision i feel as if i should tell the world about it , but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe i should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me , into my life , into my head
beautiful vineyards , fueding families , mystery , and an unlikely love story with a twist great read prepare to read this one through because it was hard to put down ! ! !
the book arrived as expected and was in great shape thanks
paul sheldon , a very good writer famous for his books in the misery series a popular character in his book is someone named misery in his final book he kills the character off , therby ending the series paul 's number one fan is annie wilkes , a retired nurse \( i would like to say , retarded \)
as i read , i kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people , whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it 's just a good tale peppered with strong political images
the andromeda strain tells the story of a bacteria growth in piedmont , arizona this bacteria kills people in a matter of seconds and killed everyone in the town except for a 69 year old man and a baby a top secret commission is formed to see how these bacteria kill people and to see how they can be stopped
still a great read , but not as good as tender at the bone and comfort me with apples foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol , but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom , dad and other relatives and friends the highs are not as high , nor the lows as low in garlic and sapphires reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader that said , i hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book
very good writing done by both authors i 've always loved c c now with du brul , the story gets even more suspenseful a really awsome page turner get this one
this is most definitely my favorite book on earth ! i'm so serious , this is such a cool book it really appeals to anyone kids could read it because there are short sentances and pictures \( some tough words though start with epiplectic \? \? \) but teens and adults \( i'm sure \) can also appreciate the morbid and brilliant humor of edward gorey for anyone that thinks that 10 is too much to spend on a little book , \( \( you may be right in some circumstances \) \) but this is such a fantastic book i know i am gushing but i love it soooooooo much ! ! !
even though you know before you start reading that this book will have a happy ending , it is a fun read a well written and pleasant book one of the best of this falls crop i am already waiting for the next book in the series
i found this book to contain some really sound advice and i would suggest it for anyone that was contemplating risking their money on the ponies
this was the first novel i read from endo , and i have to confess to being hooked on it from the first it is both interesting from a historical perspective , taking in an event that was singularly fascinating , and deeply profound from a psychological perspective it is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day
i was given this book by a friend as a going away gift the day i decided to read it , i was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting i was a bit drowsy , but i could not but it down it made me nervous , excited , sad , and happy all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
dry is anything but what the title of this work implies the pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on augusten burroughs breath a must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction the writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth , funny , yet foreboding and diary like in its presentation burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it , especially the limited usefulness of rehab the story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call , a hard core drinker as he anticipates the next one passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas , job and sexual conundrums dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them this is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle , yet has a strong finish an earlier work 'running with scissors' was apparently good enough for hollywood , so take a shot with dry after all , when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do , it might be time to slow down , stop and get a copy of twelve steps and twelve traditions , and a copy of dry cheers ! !
omg ! ! ! i could not put this book down i am in my upper twenties and i am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already yes the book is bios about natural progesterone , so what i have not personally used progesterone cream yet , because i am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that 's what i need but even if i do n't , everything else provided in the book is amazing information your diet , your vitamins , your stress level , your physical activity , everything is co related to most woman 's hormonal imbalances they even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life , she achieved hormone balancing if you are suffering from hormonal imbalances , i will strongly recommend this book i also bought other ones that i will be reading after this one but i started with be lean by romy seleznov , which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did , then i continued with this book , and the next one i will be reading is natural hormone balance for women by uzzi reiss , which does cite this book as well
whilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress , it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget , which colours match , which accessories never date , and how to dress for evening functions of any nature
the quirky illustrations done by the masterful dave mckean at once contribute to the book 's charm , but also lend to its dread however , this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares some people may not appreciate dave mckean 's artwork as much as they should , because it is so different , at least to those not familiar with the sandman graphic novel series written by neil gaiman in which dave mckean did the cover art for all the books at first glance the layout might seem confusing , even distracting , yet it somehow works here neil gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing he introduces us to a charming young girl named lucy , who suspects something is not right with her home and though her pig puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear , the rest of her family do not until it 's too late the action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end , though perhaps it is not you be the judge this is a worthy book to read to third graders and above , though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern neil gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience , one so unfamiliar with his other work i highly recommend this book
if you are planning to become a landlord , buy this essential book before you purchase a rental property or hang that for rent sign in front of your house a healthy dose of legal reality will counterbalance any easy money ideas you may have and help you decide whether the work and risk involved in being a landlord is how you would like to make money the legal concepts you learn may even influence which properties you buy and how you maintain them
this is the story of another tragic episode involving a native american tribe that this probably happened under other circumstances , and happened to more than the arapaho tribe , cannot be doubted this is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more the characters are strong , believable , and you want the best for all of them the underlying plot selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died is heartbreaking the reunion of one such child with her father made me weep and vicki 's trial reconciliation with ben gave me hope this is a great work , written with deep feeling
this book was extremely well written it 's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all what totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time , i have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20 's she most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end for example , on page 233 , and if all the gifts of life are good , perhaps , too , are all the shapes she chooses to take , and which we cannot alter the book is filled with hints at the time period even though , after looking at countless reviews , the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that lud in the mist did not and it was a fantastical piece of literature in my opinion , this book was totally based on the time period there 's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he 's not white anymore he has come down in the world if you 're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20 's , this is an astounding piece
my husband bought this book for me and i have to say it is not a book i would normally pick up i also have to say i loved it ! it was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way i enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer
a team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the earth 's surface in antarctica they set off on their adventure only to learn that a team , like themselves , was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again they also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind but these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team
this rather strangely titled book is a tribute to the demand for elizabeth bishop 's work it is a set of pieces gleaned from some 3 , 500 pages in the vassar college library collection not exactly random \( but almost \) here are 108 poems , some prose , notes she took , some sketches , some facimilies of her papers , some sketches she made , and other pieces harder to describe
this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it it is warm and comforting a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what
my fav essay was about the river also , now when watching the evening news , the link between fire and flood makes alot of sense thanks for the enlightenment
i was a reasonably big fan of the wizard of oz when i was a kid i 'd seen the judy garland film , the return to oz film , my parents had taken me to a theatre production , and there used to be a cartoon series about dorothy and her friends that i quite liked here in australia , though , you do n't see an awful lot of the wizard of oz books , and i missed out on all that as a kid i managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story , and i really liked it it 's really a shame i could n't find it earlier
this book was wonderful the rich grandeur of the south is alive in this story of unimaginable dedication and love this book had me teared up more than a few times
we know some things about saul of tarsus \( later named the apostle paul \) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information most everything we know from paul is from the dr luke in the book of acts or paul 's epistles themselves ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements peter , in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates paul 's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them
i 've been reading a chapter a day for over a yr it 's a great motivator for the day ahead i 've found this translation to be the best i 've read other translations have been boring or too dense this one was very powerful
this is the first novel by philip roth that i actually like portnoy 's complaint was a good hundred page novella , spread out over a three hundred page book the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions , and his kvetching about his parents operation shylock was also too pre occupied with pushing a political agenda \( but just what agenda , we are never sure \) this is roth 's primary fault as an author he is too didactic i find that i really do n't care much about what roth 's political opinions are ironically , this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling it shows that he thinks deep thoughts
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
if you want to buy the book , go ahead , just be careful of superbookdeals , they take your money but do n't deliver and do n't answer emails caveat emptor
hugh hewitt is right on target encouraging republicans to remain loyal to president george w bush we are confronted with a long term fight against islamic nihilists the democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s indeed , if the democratic party returns to power , the war on terror will be severely compromised if not lost even theological modernists like myself recognize that the republican party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order and yes , we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like senator lincoln chafee but what about the republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands \? these folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006 many of them possess a suicidal nietzschean streak in their heart of hearts , they idiotically believe we should let the democrats win so that the republican party can be purified the author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis hopefully , he starts to do so real soon before it 's too late
just when you think you 've got gemmell figured out , he turns the tables on you fans of gemmell and jon shannow might find the book a bit slow at first , and something of a retread of previous jerusalem man tales , but be patient the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve ! readers unfamiliar with shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous stones of power books before this one you wo n't be disappointed gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late 20th century
i have spent my life wishing that i could change things over which i seemed to have no control rob explains that the reason for this is that my subconscious mind is holding on to old beliefs that are limiting me he goes on to tell how psych k is a safe , powerful , and simple way to change those beliefs using balances that integrate the hemispheres of the brain it is prayer coming true for me quickly and lastingly i have followed up reading the book by taking the basic and advanced training workshops and am using psych k to find peace in my life and am helping others do the same in theirs this book is written so that it is easy to read and very informative for someone like me who is looking for ways to improve their life
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row , at least in the state of mississippi , and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however , some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain
i just finished the book today and i will start out by saynig that this is a very good read i will not spoil the plot if you have not read this book oh , and this book is not scary , but it really is creepy give it a go

we would expect a well balanced approach to writing about the work of the holy spirit in the church by the author who also wrote tyranny of the urgent and we get it ! in this book , charles e hummel , former president of intervarsity christian fellowship , first reviews the history and growth of the various charismatic groups within both the protestant and catholic churches he provides many valuable explanations of the meaning of related scriptures as well as observations of healings and prophecies that he himself has seen he later gives his recommendations for keeping the holy spirit fire in the fireplace of a biblical church body i came away encouraged in my own spiritual gifts and reminded that the more extraordinary spirit gifts have not disappeared and that to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
i 'd definitely recommend it not only to the knowledge management professionals , but to the general public it 's a fun and easy read
blanchard and hybels and hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a christian point of view while reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership , they put together an excellent framework for leadership the summary checklist , given on pp 171ff , offer a helpful concise summary of the book the glaring omission , and one that i ca n't believe that hybels would make , is to clearly point out that following jesus' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with jesus , in other words , you ca n't lead like jesus if you do n't have him in your life to help you i ca n't believe that there was n't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further i believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book but for the christian , it is an excellent book
many novels of the african american experience in the united states use the theme of passing these novels generally involve a light complexioned african american who can pass for white among other things , novels based on a theme of passing allow the character and the author to comment upon black white relationships in the united states from both sides from the black experience and from the white experience
you , the reader , are the subject and the hero of calvino 's novel , an exercise in reader response theory gone mad calvino 's lively experiment begins by describing a reader \( that is , you \) reading calvino 's novel and , after this opening , you settle in to read the novel that you were meant to be reading a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter
this is my all time favorite book ! i have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book it is definately one of nicholas sparks bests
deadly feasts tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book it tracks the discovery of prions , the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease , scrapie , and creutzfeldt jacob disease following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties , bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties , and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on , rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists , from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation , yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school , to the hyper competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were
this book was very candid and well written it shows that bob primary goal was to build a business , and become rich and he succeed the idea that he sold it as a media for african american pride is what got him in trouble pulley shows that it was strictly business mr johnson need not so defensive , what he created made him rich , this book shows that wealth does not equal respect \? nevertheless he has 3 billion dollars and hopefully plenty of time to write a final chapter of which he can be prou

having spent the last year in the near east , i found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues while this book was written about the isreal lebanon issue during the 1970 's 1980 's , though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months , it was as i said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture with the world attention squarely on the near east we all , weather american , european , or other cultures throughout the world , need to know and understand the near eastern mentality , culture , and to some extend how the islamic religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area with this book being written by a jewish american and with thomas freidman 's understanding of the near east way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for i recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the near east , politicians and military personnel , religious leaders , and anyone who wants a better understanding of the near east in general
i just finished reading the handyman 's dream , by nick poff i was completely blown away ! this is a great book its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town indiana after the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner the story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that i havent seen in any other gay novels i love the way the author integrates music and songs into the story from the character norma \( ed 's mother \) and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful mrs penfield , the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do this story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past , and one many still have today i love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks anyone who believes in the power of love i wish while growing up i would have had a book like this one to show me that there is such a thing as good , healthy gay relationships i highly recommend the handyman 's dream

if you 're interested in reproducing authentic costumes , you wo n't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book i have n't found anything close to it intended for collectors , it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather until a generation or so ago , no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat it 's a valuable addition to any costume library

i saw the second title of this series at my local borders bookstore , and decided to try the first title do not be fooled by the young adult category this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read though a little adolescent at times , this novel is still excellent , and i recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy
when peter s lynch speaks , wise investors will listen this book covers the famous fund manager 's career at the helm of fidelity magellan from 1977 to '90 , and post career into '92 it 's far more introspective than one up on wall street and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose for example , there is n't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former my belief is that the reader would do best by reading one up on wall street first and follow up with this title , as its the newer of the two , regardless

never before have i been moved so completely by a simple reference book the author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for l ron hubbard 's dianetics not an easy task i bought this for my grandmother and she hates books that 's how good this is better than cats , she says i ca n't say i necessarily agree with her for starters , the private sector 's influence on public policy and decision making is nowhere near as entertaining as mister mistofellees' song and dance but who am i to argue with an old woman \? nobody , that 's who

i am a longtime jance fan and was n't disappointed with dead wrong any complaints would be the overemphasis on joanna 's pregnancy with a concomitant under emphasis on tension and suspense \( great ending , though ! \) butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book , but also comes across as overly self absorbed , especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child jenny , too has little to add to the story but joanna shines , as usual nice to see such a reliable , ethical , and strong female protagonist
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book , it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it , even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion , i could be wrong
i liked this book because it was quick and easy to read , but also had more in depth information in the back each month , there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the er , call your doc , or wait 24 hours to check there were great decision guides that presented both sides i like that i know a reputable hospital stands behind the book , as well i have 6 pregnancy books , but this one is my favorite
background
terrier will not disappoint tamora pierce fans ! the narration is done through first person , told as a journal this is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story , and difficult to account for actions the narrator has n't seen but tamora has performed her usual magic , snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last \( i even read all of the notes pages and the bio \) readers may find it difficult to put down once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo
this is the third book i have read by grisham , and so far i have really enjoyed each one grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller this book does not have any courtroom court case scenes , which i really enjoy , but it still kept my attention very well grisham gives you just enough inside details to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer for example at one point , the clues seemed to point to fletcher coal being involved in the killings , but that was way off the mark in the end this characteristic of grisham 's writings makes for a very enjoyable read
i bought this book because my mother is dying and i needed to know more kessler has a wonderful way of delivering this knowledge he is thorough in imparting this knowledge and does so with total compassion for the dying and the living i underscored many passages in this work and especially appreciated someone telling me \( chapter 8 \) what can i expect in the way of physical signs as mom goes through the dying process this book is very user friendly having a very readable quality i strongly recommend it
this collection of stories and essays by david sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety overall , i found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful some stories were a bit dry , but others such as santaland diaries and diary of a smoker had me laughing out load however , the best stories i found were the ones such season 's greetings to our friends and family ! ! ! which i had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor i would definitely like to read more of sedaris' works , especially those based on his real life experiences as , overall , i found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories
guys and dolls is a fantastic musical , and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it unfortunately , some songs like marry the man today , my time of day , follow the fold and the oldest established have been left out from the book , but that is the price you pay , or rather do n't pay , when you do n't buy the full vocal score however , this book will satisfy fans of the show , complete with pictures from the original 1950 broadway production , the 1955 film , and the new 1992 broadway revival definately , this book is a good buy

in this fascinating collection of essays , dr dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis over the last twenty five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies , an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms , subsidised housing , free by weekly pay checks , child support and free medical benefits from a liberal political standpoint , this support for the nation 's have nots is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor one would logically assume that providing the poor with life 's essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society in fact , as dalrymple proposes , it has had an opposite effect crime in his native england has skyrocketed drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence why \? liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives , it is always the rich , the government or societies institutions that is to blame , thus crime continues to rise while england 's welfare state has grown into an unwieldy goliath
this is a pretty good book however , i would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of lincoln 's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective

this is a simple , yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural china of the 1920s and 1930s the story centers on pei , who as a young girl , is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory the story evolves as pei befriends other women in the silk factory , participates in a strike for fair working conditions , reconnects with her family , loses loved ones , and escapes from advancing japanese soldiers the plot is succinct and the characters are interesting , varied , and believable , if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth socio cultural aspects of life in 1920s 30s china are elegantly woven into the plot themes of friendship , love , and courage are convincingly presented overall , the book is a captivating read , and strongly recommended
this thing sat on my shelf , half read for the longest time only the notice of the upcoming release this november of pynchon 's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again it 's not that it is n't brilliant no one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder the first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you 'll ever read
this is a great book i will not go into so much detail as the previous reviewers , but i must give credit where it is due having read many books on the subject of the bush white house including , fiasco , and state of denial , i did not think i would learn much more from this one i bought the book a few days ago , mainly because i like david corn when i read it i was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is i think along with the two books i mentioned earlier , this trio make up the essential reading on bush , iraq , and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories if you could only read one , i would call it a dead heat between , hubris , and , state of denial if pressed i suppose i would have to give the edge to hubris , as the writing was much less tedious i thought

this bible blew me away when i went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life i was so impressed , i bought one for myself this bible is many things , but the first thing that i noticed , quite honestly , is that the colors were bright , the print readable , and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical bible without growing to an unwieldy size , the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information , written in a modern , friendly style , that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the good book both understandable and relevant to today 's society that is what makes it perfect for someone , like my young friend , who is unfamiliar with religion , christianity , or just plain old bible study it 's less intimidating that most bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you do n't feel unprepared if you pick it up cold catholics are often les familiar with the bible than many protestant denominations , as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile however , a better relationship and understanding of the word can only enhance one 's spiritual life and experience as a catholic if that applies to you \( which , i have to admit , it did to me \) this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in biblical translation , discussion , interpretation , and modern relevance who wo n't like this bible \? 1 those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the king james version 2 those already familiar with intensive bible study , if not working with youth or those less familiar 3 most protestants the discussion is from a very clear catholic viewpoint not really controversial , just catholic 4 and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the bible accessible and relevant through use of the lingo parlance and point of view of today 's under 25 set i believe one reviewer felt that the bible did n't need to be made culturally relevant , finding the sidebars on race , cultural differences , modern morality , and varying interpretations to be just another extension of the political correctness movement i could n't disagree more the bible should be the one book that everyone can see themselves in should they seek such a thing this bible does that for a new generation of catholics and for a new , hesitant group of explorers i 'd ballpark the appropriate age for this version at around 13 35 years
i handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they could n't order any more reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in europe that he carries you along i especially love the story of little portugal , which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one the us could learn from that example , and from many other european examples in this book when you read the story about ge and honeywell , you 'll realize we 're going to have to , because they 're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not

i listened to isaac 's storm on cd while painting a room , and it made the time fly ! the cd rendition was clearly spoken and had excellent production value that said , i also loved the story i am a weather hound , and i enjoyed the detail of the way in which the nation maintained it 's weather bureau \( i had recently read the children 's blizzard and i would consider this as a nice companion book for we weather hounds \) the descriptions from survivors was threaded effectively along with a panoramic view of the galveston tragedy i have not read the book , but i found the cd riveting
in his book trading risk , ken grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for tudor investments and sac capital to create an insightful and surprisingly non technical guide for traders and portfolio managers as director of trader development at a large proprietary trading house , i have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders moreover , this is a scalable difference risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades , results of trading days , and performance across entire quarters where i believe grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply cutting your losses trading risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades , from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results his discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of self analysis that is rarely practiced
once again i am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject i bought this to get a better feel for the old testament operative word is feel as a roman catholic , the old testament is addressed in the first reading at mass , but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner it is particularly confusing , hard to read , and difficult to understand in proper context , without some help in fact there are portions of the old testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous davis 's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people , in a certain time and place , and within a historical milieu it may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like , but it is sufficient to be effective
i was fortunate enough to have seen the now legendary vermeer exhibition at the national gallery of art in washington , d c during the winter of 1995 96 21 out of the 35 or 36 extant paintings by vermeer were included in the show , offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of vermeer 's amazing works in a single space , something that no one has experienced since 1696 , when 20 of his paintings were auctioned in delft given the rarity and fragility of vermeer 's works , it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated all who were unable to make it to the show , however , have this splendid book as a document of this unique event this book will remain the standard work on vermeer for many decades , and represents the fruit of several years' labor by art historians on two continents because so little is in fact known about vermeer the man in truth , we have no idea at all what vermeer 's education , interests , and personality were like , the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing vermeer 's work within the history of dutch painting , the development of perspective , and the fascinating tale of vermeer 's rediscovery in the 19th century and his richly deserved rise to worldwide fame the essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers , as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct vermeer 's exact technique , something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves no drawings by vermeer have survived , nor have any statements he may have made about painting this extensive scholarly apparatus , while illuminating and occasionally even riveting the essay dealing with vermeer 's rediscovery is a great detective narrative ! , tends to obscure the strange , even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with vermeer 's personal world so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano the music lesson vibrate with dramatic tension sadly , the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures all of which are superbly reproduced in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue what is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry , novels and countless studies \? i was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images , but the traditional overly scholarly and dry art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the sphinx of delft that said , the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist barring some new discovery , it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about vermeer and his world than can be read here , exquisitely designed , and distinguished with beautiful reproductions the volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book when i attended the show , the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback johannes vermeer is the text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon immerse yourself in vermeer 's world and you will be transformed seeing this exhibition changed my life , and i treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time i hope you will enjoy this book as much as i have

while this book had some minor flaws \( i 'll discuss those briefly later \) , it is worth owning , especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of cirque du soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every day the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic , the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances
yes , it 's cliche yes , the plot is lifted directly from star wars yes , there are obvious references to anne mccaffrey , tolkien and other fantasy writers but who cares \?
i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly , i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience , especially in nyc 's best restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective \( as objective as food tastes get , i suppose \) review a very easy and enjoyable read

give up dieting forever ! i have and i am now losing weight eating anything , yes anything , i want can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened \? this is the book that will set you free , this is the book you need has it struck you that dieting is unnatural \? do n't eat this , do n't eat that , count this , count that , measure this , measure that , i ca n't have this , and i ca n't have that , ad nauseum which diet guru are you going to believe \? can you reall stay with a low carb diet or a high carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life \? most importantly , do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life \? the first day of my new eating pattern i ate two meals the second day , i woke up with no hunger , no reactive hypoglycemia \( nausea and shakes from hunger \) ! what a miracle i have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything i want for dinner \( i love to cook and desire to eat with my family \) at maintenance , i may end up eating two meals a day i do n't know and it certainly is n't something to worry about the diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later , etc , are wrong , wrong , wrong maybe it sounds theoretically correct , but it does not work that way listen , i have found out the less you eat , the less you eat i do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach by the way , dr dean edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself he says there is no scientific proof that x number of meals are better than one also , i want you dear readers to know that i have four friends who are naturally slim \( adult women 30 's and 40 's \) two of them eat a small amount for lunch \( like a small hamburger \) and a good dinner \( they are sizes 3 and 6 \) one gal eats at 2 30 pm , a huge amount , and a snack at night \( she is size 7 \) one gal does nibble all day , like a potato chip here and there \( no thank you , personally \) oh , and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner , never lunch remember my comeback for sabotagers slim people do n't need much food , even if we exercise who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two \? the only negative thing i have to say about diane 's book is that i felt she took scripture out of context god fed the israelites manna 2x a day they were supernaturally filled and nourished he does not feed anyone manna today also , biblical gluttony is not overeating \( i do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin , but not gluttony \) biblical gluttony refers to the roman type parties where people overate , overdrank and went on to commit more sin on the positive side , i do believe diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism this book is an answer to prayer you wo n't be sorry if you buy this book
i really liked this one because of the characters and of course the background being about wine and the lifestyle of those who create it \) i definitely recommend this one

this book provides the reader with a clear , basic understandingof the grounding of popular opinion regarding gay life during the last50 years while the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope , this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life , and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are i only hope that it will inspire others whose experience of being gay is a relatively new one to realize how important political activism and community still is not only that , a very engaging read
loved it highly suggest it could n't put it down
with over 1000 recipes , this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it 's paces , but i 've had great results with the few dishes i 've tried so far the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked , with a gem of a condiment included pickled red onion i 'd use that on any sandwich , anytime the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette \( really a sambal vinaigrette \) and wasabi cream were awesome veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners

what a wonderful book this author has written it talks about developing interpersonal skills , public speaking skills , prospecting skills , networking etiquette , sales skills , marketing principles , and even customer service it mentions the power of the thank you note , and of giving more than you receive it also devotes a chapter on some things about home based businesses and a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing , and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity i'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included quite frankly , i think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here and i think chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book , and not included in this book either but who cares ! anybody interested in the main thrust of the book \( endless referrals \) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 and they are well written and informative

the authors map out clear , effective and proven strategies for rewarding parenting in this excellent well written guide an imaginative approach was called for when my 16 year old boy jonathan threatened to barricade himself in his bedroom using just twigs , leaves , and his own spittle and dung , and this guide provided just that there 's nothing wrong with setting parameters , the authors say , just as long as that are not arbitrary or capricious and they are clearly articulated and for crying out loud why should he be allowed to act like a nesting african hornbill under my roof

the position enjoyed by mohammed as a prophet of god is disputed by his unprovoked attacks on innocent people islam was spread by use of the sword because americans are poorly educated on religious history in general and middle eastern history in particular , this book is a must read it is a single source for how islam became as powerful as it is today the editor uses multiple sources to document the facts necessary to allow the reader to support the assertion that islam is a violent religion
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking , which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it , i read it as a novel , for entertainment years later , i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading , i was able to examine the russian names , characters , events , and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog , which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going , which it certainly is , but in it , tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence , each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space , with one atom colliding at random with another , but when a sufficient number act in concert , such as napoleon 's invasion of russia , their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar , he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom , who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self deluding as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms , then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature this one tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one or any other deity , but he does say that history , time , and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path , and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go , then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov , who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going

liz perle does a really nice job in money , a memoir of weaving statistics , professional studies , and other people 's experiences with her own personal experience and insight while many parts of her book sound familiar \( e g , women shopping when they 're in a slump \) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard the other thing i appreciated about the book was that perle does n't claim to have all the answers , and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money , which to me sounded like something i could attempt and achieve thanks , liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read

this is the best book available on the great storm of 1900 and its effect on galveston , texas an unbelievable amount of research obviously went into it very well written highly recommended
mcneill calls american indians and africans little more than the victims of the west in this book he explains that they have little role in the development of culture \( which he sees as passing from society to society from mesopotamia on , like some sort of conceptual olympic torch \) and some get it and others do not it is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history , and difficult to read without cringing
red lily is clearly the best book in the series while reading this one i could visualize the scenes this book would make a good movie , but i ca n't decide under what category it would fit into although it 's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller with all the talk of a ghost \( as the rest of the series \) this book it is n't a believable read as much as a fun read
for those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one , you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through the writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of china and its muscle power instead of branding china as a villain , we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains , china would n't be where it is now wal mart is covered in detail the writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing , it 's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when china has perfected its manufacturing bases just as japan and south korea had done before it then , there 's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located , and how china is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour china 's progress is n't simply detrimental to other countries on contrary , it benefits them as well for example , australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to china with increase of living standard in china , chinese needs more nutritious food as china could n't provide enough , united states particularly the middle states are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the middle kingdom then , there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping united states in check by siding with china , and also the love and hate relationship between usa and china of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in china and so forth whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided \( since china has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time \) , suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks yes , some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately , i think they are missing the points what 's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about china and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come highly recommended

i just finished the book last night , crying as i read the last few pages i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press she was a delightful and woman , filled with life , which makes her ending even more tragic the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde

every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator the mid first century of rome was such a time and tacitus was such a communicator the histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history the historian will do well to read tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity while observing and commenting on the human element in history , tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil , wars , and rumors of wars his beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity his example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow
philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references he gives the reader a wonderful sense of the social , religious and political forces that motivated the pilgrims in their incredibly risky venture into the unknown the book presents a fascinating view of the clash of the native american and english cultures that tragically led to the near annihilation of the new england indians
i enjoyed reading the mark it was definitely a page turner of course it makes me want to continue with the series tim f lahaye is a great author and story teller i actually visualized the whole the thing i would thank him in person if i could , for a wonderful job done
first , the strengths andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists , with chapters on munsterberg , arnheim , eisenstein , balazs , kracauer , bazin , mitry , metz , and ayfre , and agel he focuses on the debate between the formalists \( who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing , framing , mise en scene , lighting , and etc \) and the realist tradition \( who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography , a physical impression of its subject \) the highlight is undoubtedly andrew 's excellent discussion of the great french critic andre bazin , which is not surprising since andrew 's ph d thesis was on bazin the weaknesses this was published in 1976 , and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then , especially feminism , and the influence of lacan and psychoanalytic theory still , this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory
hi i would say most people should run , not walk , to buy this book it does n't matter where you are starting from , everyone can benefit from this stuff , and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about i found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money i would recommend it to all my friends , especially those who are befuddled by the markets , because it has simple straightforward advice good luck to all the savers and investors among us ! for socially conscious people , they also tell how to help society \( as well as get wealthy
tony sweet 's photographs are breathtaking ! as you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way , you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work i am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work i think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book

being a dyed in the wool mcguane fan , i think he just keeps getting better not only is he the best fishing writer alive , but his non fishing stories are bizzarely entertaining , have an interesting twist , and always explore human interaction i believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences , from crazy street people to ego crazed ceos , as well as the many places he has lived who else would know what a cabinet is , except a rhode island resident \? what no mention of hot weiners or coffee milk \?
i was anxious to try the artisanal gougere recipe , and i was not disappointed ! the cheese puffs were light and cheesey and beautiful to look at ! i compared his recipe to le cordon blue recipe , and his adds a pinch of baking powder and about 2 3 times the amount of cheese plus he give approximate mixing times , which was a blessing for me since i had never made cream puff dough before the cordon blue version had no mixing times and with such a small amount of cheese compared to the artisanal version i cannot believe that it would be anywhere near as good this book appears to have terence 's personal touch , not just regurgitation of classic bistro recipes
based on 20 pages of an unfinished charlotte bronte manuscript , you forget that it was written in 2004 and are quickly enjoying what feels like a long lost bronte ! ms boylan takes into consideration charlotte 's growing concern \( at the time of her death \) with children born into extreme poverty and deprivation the plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan \( emma \) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to london 's back streets of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel

having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but , this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy , it is extremely informative and , if read with an open mind , refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on just to let the information sink in

i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly , i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience , especially in nyc 's best restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective \( as objective as food tastes get , i suppose \) review a very easy and enjoyable read

as one of america 's greatest presidents , ronald reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and , like abraham lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations this book and his earlier autobiography , where 's the rest of me , will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions this work , an american life , however , will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life , during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor for anyone who had the pleasure of listening to reagan 's political commentaries on the radio , or hearing him speak as governor of california or as president of the united states , the book will be particularly enjoyable for it is written in the easy going conversational style that reagan used in life what makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which ronald reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today you may also observe that the problems of reagan 's day are not much different than those we face today i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand ronald reagan , how his many faceted character was formed , the inner workings of his mind , and the actions which led to his monumental achievements in my view , it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every american child
jeff shaara never ceases to amaze i have absolutely loved everyone of his \( and his fathers \) books i have been waiting awhile for him to delve into world war 2 and he did not disappoint me first things first , i could not put this book down everything about it was phenomenal icant explain it in any other way please read this book even if you dont like books like this it is well worth your time
i love historical fiction , and the march was one of the better historical novels that i 've read the characters are well drawn , and the action moves along briskly , with no dead spots the civil war background seemed very authentic , and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions , the march blends the two to show that war really is hell
are you ready to become a home gamer are you seriously looking to improve your current results in the stock market \? do you have a moderate level of knowledge about the stock market and our economic system \? are you equally concerned with preserving your capital while earning a better than average return \? do you prefer a system that incorporates probability and statistics as a tool to assess risk \? are you a believer in using fundamental analysis and technical analysis in choosing growth stocks as your preferred investment \? do you have adequate time and interest to devote to actively managing your portfolio \?
the pelican brief is one of john grisham 's more fast paced and exciting book
i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away , it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places , like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world
i love this book in conjunction with dr perricone 's books they compliment each other nicely a great tweak to feeling and looking better
for those of you who might find the first found book or this second one offensive in its content guess what \? life is offensive and for that matter , life is also often tragic , poignant , ironic , hysterically funny , random , and sometimes all of these things at once the found books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life that 's what makes it so remarkable indeed , how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages \? this work by davy rothbart , co editor jason bitner , and all the found crew deserves praise because this is a cross section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials if , several thousand years from now , \( android \? zombie \? \) archeologists study our current century , they might go through our trash think of found as giving them a headstart

john lynch wrote a classic in spanish american revolutions 1808 1826 he masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of latin america from spain the book starts in rio de la plata and ends in mexico and central america curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the creole ruling class the reluctance of spanish monarchy \( and later even of liberals \) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the creoles \( spanish born in america \) for all of those who are interested in a better understanding of latin american societies of today this great book is a must lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the hispanic american societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis two thumbs up

i recommend that most people do not read this book if you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway , please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so \( and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on amazon \) magical realism jewish history , religion , culture and humor \( although the last is perhaps redundant \) memory folk lore the english language love the nature of histories sex death pain narrative style and voice the multiplicity of human , and likewise jewish , experience imagination i will assert , because i hope it is true , that you do n't need to all of these things to enjoy illuminated , but you do need to be familiar with some of it and you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it all those with self diagnosed a d d need not bother cracking the spine however , even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you , everything may be indeed sadly obfuscated or perhaps less disappointingly , only partly obfuscated if so , do n't get angry do n't curse the gods or creative writing programs and certainly , if you are going to write bad reviews on amazon , preface it first with your own faults as a reader lastly , buck up read another book even the bible \( another little book high up on the best seller 's list \) is not for everyone

my only caveat about this otherwise enjoyable installment in the eve dallas series is that the web site did not prominently state \( i e , i missed it ! \) that this had previously been published as part of an anthology i made the mistake of only checking the publishing date , decided it was a new novella published independently \( as would be deserved , given the track record of the series \) , and ordered it without checking further my bad but a reminder to readers who want to buy everything from the series be sure to read the description carefully enough to determine whether it is a previously published in a book you already own item !

dorothy parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past her wit is biting and at it 's best in this collection , favourite reads are for the individual to decide , however , for me , as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance , as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye , for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle

in some ways km soehnlein 's the world of normal boys reminded me of the teenage novels of paul zindel there is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time zindel wrote specifically for adolescents soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post pubescent boys and its social implications although the book is written for adults , it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us
this is a book about beauty , passion , a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts , especially music , craves and feels , the fire that burns within a book that dares to take one , if one dares to take that step , on a journey deep into the bare souls of it 's characters the story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot , or develops into dramatic changes for the characters that is not what the author wanted to convey , and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity , and not expect the characters to travel actively without the book gives us these people , the town , the surroundings it brings us deep into the realities , the thoughts , the complexities of the human soul the people are good , bad , ugly , beautiful , selfish , depressed , found , or lost but from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in mick kelly 's soul , and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town , then the author reveals her own soul with her words , for those that pick up on what her words show i am still amazed at the power this book has any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book , should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous
gods and generals is an extremely well done and fascinating book the author , jeff shaara , did an excellent job of interpreting the characters his task was a difficult one because his father 's book , the killer angels is a classic in the chronicles of civil war stories this book precedes the one written by his father
i picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching mystic river , the film based on another lehane novel darkness , take my hand did not disappoint different characters , same setting , and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil lehane 's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing , a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre lehane 's descriptions jump right off the page at you his characters are so human , so intense , their dialogue so sharp , that it 's almost like watching a movie in your mind there is n't a wasted word in this book the suspense starts to build on page 1 , and never lets up , becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter this is a stay up late read to finish only when you 're not alone in the night

gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor on page 16 , he writes a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries , department buildings , and museums then he asks but where is the university \? this is the category mistake cartesian question where is the mind \? has a same confusion , he asserts
the concept of mind is a great book for several reasons the main reason to me is that ryle clarifies the concept of being human , while he uses language in a natural way in stead of constructing concepts based on \( for example scientific \) assumptions , he shows what we already see as obvious , just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language he is far from reductionistic mark the subtle irony 'man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine he might , after all , be a sort of animal , namely , a higher mammal there has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man
different , refreshing , entertaining , funny , eye opening even better than reading the book is to listen to it \( buy the audio cd ! \) on a loooooong drive

loved this book i think that this is a must read for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation the only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it working in the field , we see first hand the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals i wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal i will say that i cried during parts of the book

while not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as aquinas or pannenberg \( as another review here stresses \) , this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence this is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of scriptural data concerning each topic , its apologetic engagement with differing views , and its practical counsel for life and ministry it is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions i recommend it highly

until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions as rogers clearly points out , most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon an inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors

imagine you 're attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you 're doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water in essence , fire your boss is just that stephen pollan 's discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of careering in not just corporate america but any occupational arena it 's an easy , conversational and straightforward read that imho should be called hire your boss pollan , a life coach with the style , chutzpah and hubris of a donald trump scott adams hybrid , elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace your boss pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it 's helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations simply put , managers will continue to act purely out of self interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives with this in mind , what will avail those of the non management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision , with more of a hired gun approach rather than that of a sycophant many of pollan 's precepts will at first seem counterintuitive such as work for the money , the love will follow or lose your career , get a job and may come across as trite and cynical however when taken in context the underlying schema is this a job is a means of providing income no more , no less trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self destruction the author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market
i liked this book , but i notice that all the critics seem to hate it it did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off i picked it up because walter laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism written in 1886 , it suggests that there is a pan european anarchist underground , which the protagonist gets mixed up with it is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy , who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction the prose is wonderful , as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters' personalities , if you have the taste for that sort of thing all in all , it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel i finished it with regret i had previously read and liked portrait of a lady , which is a superior novel as much as i liked it , i would have to say do not start with princess as an introduction to james incidentally , i have a theory about the omniscient narrator in james' books being a malign demiurge , but i will spare you that theorizing here

though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through , your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read gaston bachelard 's the poetics of space bachelard argues that language especially poetry can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space , especially of our home space for example , he considers how common phrases such as go up to the attic and go down to the basement are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends , while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended as he does with other such observations , bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives in addition to exploring how we experience space and place , bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight roughly speaking , he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something by reading this beautifully written and engaging book , you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived , grown up , felt comfortable or alienated , had a feeling of wonder or fear , etc i recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space , in language and what it can reveal to us , or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language

i was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of nebula award winners this book is not at all your typical sf story , indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some sf aspects than it does an sf story i'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction , so this holds a good deal of appeal for me

the first book in nr 's 'born in' series is wonderful , you do n't want to miss it ! born in fire focuses on maggie concannon , a tempermental and loyal woman who is also a gifted artist gallery owner rogan sweeney takes an interest in maggie 's fabulous glass creations , and soon after takes a personal interest in maggie herself maggie is a wonderful character , stubborn and flawed , yet still caring nora does a fabulous job of developing maggie , and does it in a way that she seems like a real person rogan is an extremely likeable hero maggie 's sister , brianna , is her complete opposite quiet , sweet , and calm the relationship between the two sisters , however , is very touching and very real this book is full of colourful characters , some we love and some we hate the romance between rogan and maggie is wonderful basically , i just ca n't say enough good things about this book you will love it
cahill 's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste this is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained some missing context , some missing closure and they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense , as stories may focus on nature , archaeology , sociology , etc while the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference , there is good information \( ex wisdom of cave diving \) some stories hit the vicarious adventurer 's sweet spot the author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in kentucky , engaging the reader with educational content \( ex barometric effect on air flow \) , spectacular descriptions \( ex lightening igniting bat guano \) , and hair raising suspense \( ex getting lost in a maze of passages \) not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me , but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits
by far a very thorough and intelligent read i could not put it down
spring snow is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written , as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right it is an eloquent , moving story with a tale as old as time , that of star crossed lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations
i read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market the phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half the raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the new era story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay but as shown by proven evidence of the past , no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later when this happens , the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible the story so far is quite simple but what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained
a late divorce is one of my very favorites novels this ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle aged couple , one of whom is in a mental institution , is told from the perspective of each member of the family children , their spouses and mates , grandson , etc i have rarely laughed so much , or been touched so much , by the insightful description of the kaminka family and their travails over a failed marriage , real estate and conflict the scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity at its best a wonderful work , original , illuminating and funny
i agree with the first reviewer this is what art criticism , politically engaged or not , should read like berger was an old time marxist i am an anglosphere conservative he is a man of the left i am of the right no matter , his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism , and at times philosophy , that i have read incredibly perceptive , sensitive , without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition , berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended he uses history but is not a historicist , for he lets the works reveal themselves openly the essay that which is held , a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of time is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of montaigne berger will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary europe danto and the americans are simply not in his league
i have enjoyed all of david gemmell 's work but this one takes the prize it contains sorrow , great sacrifice , courage , honor , and some of the best battles every written it is easy to see the scenes and the people as you read , the characters are ones you will become attached to if you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day , you will love this book
in order to properly understand the jesus of the new testament , instead of making a jesus of our own liking , it is necessary to understand jesus as he himself indicated jesus himself , according to the new testament , made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures , \( old testament \) , as he sought to explain himself , his actions , his teachings and his significance understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what jesus was and is about this means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it , and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole christopher wright 's book , knowing jesus through the old testament , is an absolute godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the jesus of the new testament this book is a little bit technical at times , it is not a devotional work , but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of jesus , thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of jesus according to the background that jesus himself referred to thanks chris wright for this fabulous book also see his forthcoming book , the mission of god , due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press it looks to be another bullseye ! ! for some other great little books on jesus that are sane and sober , see jesus and his world by peter walker , the original jesus by n t wright , and for a bit of a larger work see jesus and the gospels by craig blomberg
this book provides a straight forward approach to a raw food diet , and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process it also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally , but schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need a great resource to go to when you get a nagging question , or have a concern try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet , as you will see changes in the health of your pet many veterinarians that i have spoken with are not particularly supportive my 2 y o lab has a softer coat , clearer eyes , and better muscle tone since i have started him on the diet this diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow , but the reward of having a healthy , happy pet far outweigh the associated costs good luck , and enjoy your pet
a comprehensive , entertaining and plainly written introduction to critical thinking it should be in every school and public library \( preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with pro creationist caveats \)

ordinary joy reminds you that god is in fact all around you in your ordinary living if you just take a break from all the hustle and bustle and truly appreciate his beauty joe campeau uses personal illustrations that we can relate to , and in turn , relates them to the teachings of jesus on a personal note , my own faith has waivered for quite some time that after taking a closer look , i am rediscovering god 's presence in my life and i know that , no matter what , the sun will shine tomorrow and i will be kissed by son again and again and it can never be wiped away peace and joy
the mysterious oriental mirror is ugly , and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected it wreaks havoc and sometimes kills , as is the case with several people in this book the rest are either thought mad or driven mad question if you could , would you switch places with somebody else in a different time \? i think i might , but i would like to be given a choice brandy mccabe and her granddaughter shay garrett are n't given that choice both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other 's bodies
this book provides a very interesting and informative detail of the history of birth culture in america as discovered through the study of birth chairs in incluedes intriguing pictorial documentations of birth chairs and how they evolved into the modern maternity beds in use today
having read katherine , i wanted to get my hands on another anya seton novel her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the medieval and renaissance eras are breathtaking people recommended green darkness because of its timeless romance , historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation so i gave green darkness a whirl this enormous book \( a big trade paperback with over six hundred pages \) enthralled me from beginning to end and i wish it had been longer , that the magic had n't ended despite its rather large size and intricate story , the novel ended too soon for me \( i like big books , but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume \) i finished this gem in three sittings the novel 's setting begins in the late 1960s \( around the year this was first published \) richard mardson takes his beloved wife , the american heiress celia taylor , to his estate in sussex , england there he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers , all respectable noblemen and women like richard but something strange begins to happen between them celia is experiencing deja vu , as though she 'd been there before this happens the second she enters the castle at the same time , richard becomes restless and moody celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her their lives and their marriage could be in shambles , and celia has to go back to her previous life during tudor england to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time her past life is a woman named celia bohun who falls for a handsome monk named stephen \( richard \) mardson their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering there are many twists throughout the novel
a jules vernes classic , this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time true , there are some items that may seem a bit dated , and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible yet , this novel is still a joy to read
i was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here even more stunned by the criticisms this is not a scientific treatise , and never pretends to be this is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of emergence , nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper
a wonderfully told cat tail ! the illustrations are lovely and appropriate to the playful theme of the book
i love this cookbook there are so many amazing recipes as someone who is allergic to dairy , i am totally blown away at how creamy some of the dishes are besides the recipes , the book is filled with beautiful pictures and profound quotes that combine together to create a really special reading experience i highly recommend this cookbook to vegans , vegetarians , people allergic to dairy and wheat , and meat eaters , as well
i am a kindda new wife but struggling with learning how to grow up and not be a nag stormie is very easy to understand in her book and can relate to almost anyone like another person said i do feel like this book was written just for me the written prayers help me bc sometimes i dont know how to pray for my husband and this gives u the words to say and scripture to back up everything she says also , it helps me more importantly be a better wife this isnt a book to try to get ur way and mold and change ur husband i 'd say its about giving urself up to the lord to change u and make u a better wife and praying for ur husband is selfless and probably one of the most important things u could be doing i highly recommend this book , highly it changed me almost instantly !
i have read all of van gulik 's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite the characters are intriguing and some sinister the end is satisfying and bittersweet , challenging integrity vs justice i would , however , recommend you read the others first \( chronological is good , chinese gold murders is first \) to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own
this is in my opinion john bradshaw 's best book it encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions , addictions , co dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes
i love this book ! i love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last \( i say maybe because originally buddies was supposed to be the last \) it is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested my love for dennis savage 's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with little kiwi my love for little kiwi 's innocence becomes concern for his actions it 's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result , the choices that they make are theirs , and there 's nothing you can do about it , but let them be chosen it 's hard letting little kiwi grow up and become virgil brown i imagine it 's the same way with a child , but at least then you get to see what happens ! mind you , the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle , feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next but just like just above my head by james baldwin \( which i highly recommend \) , i have been unable to pick up this book and read it again it simply leaves me realing with so many feelings , yet i would not trade the experience reading it with anything how does one mix merriment with malaise so well \? read the book and find out
this book will be invaluable now as i am going to groom my dog myself the instructions are easily understood
i love joanna brady ! however , this introduction to her and her life in bisbee is not the best book jance has ever written one thing that is terrific about jance , though , is that she is from bisbee and describes the town in exact detail bisbee is a quaint crazy town and jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert joanna brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by highly recommended ! !
this is a cute story about a spider who drops in on a farm all the farm animals greet her and invite her to play but the spider spends the day building her web instead the book is fun and informative , and not at all scary the pages are doubled so they are easy to turn , but be careful , because inquisitive little fingers may reach inside the pages and rip them the book has about 350 words
collins' efforts with his justly famed the moonstone and the woman in white have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in armadale lydia gwilt \( do n't you love the last name \? \) is one of the great unsung characters in english \( or any western \) literature collins seems to delight in making her as full bodied , as attractive to men , and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire given the tenor and social conventions of the time , her quest for revenge on the despicable alan armadale seems perfectly in keeping lydia gwilt is like an early , english scarlett o'hara without the redeeming humor scarlett was known to exhibit all in all , an extraordinarily well written and three dimensional character study
i evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that i needed more protein than i had thought and that i reacted strongly to sugars i bought this book when i decided to lose a few pounds , but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet i was already having gall bladder and liver issues i bought this book first and 2 5 years later , it is still the best reference i have the chapter on hormones is a bit technical , but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book
three of my nephews and my son 's favorite book he wore it out and i had to buy another one
i thought that the two books previous to this in the duncan kincaid gemma james series were slight disappointments kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with gemma taking the lead in a dark house is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
this is an excellent book the anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides the authors book on senegal parrots and their family is also full of information
on the surface , natsuo kirino gives us a book loaded with nail biting , page turning suspense what lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in japan women are seen as beautiful young pets , or useless old bags kirino shows a side of japan that i did n't know existed
as a therapist \( 16 yrs \) , i have been using the material in this book for reframing the experience of depression for my clients the clients i have introduced this book to are now reframing their illness as an intiation into a greater understanding of their relation to self soul while at times dry for most laypeople , it has become a reference book for my practice
in response to the guy who said this book is n't scientific i say , it 's as scientific as the diagnosis \( which is essentially a catalog of behaviors that annoy teachers , but i digress \) there 's no scientific proof that adhd actually exists as a disorder since we do n't understand the brain , or why it does things , how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything \? choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start the book is worth your time , but you should also check out hallowell or ingersoll
among all the theories of ethics with which i am familiar , i have always found kant 's system to be the best carrying out one 's duty for the sake of the duty itself the problem with kant , however , is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity , dependent on a source of which we can never , some may claim , have any understanding christine korsgaard fixes , at least for me , this problem , by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality in short , the source of normativity is our humanity itself
highly recommended ! the text is engaging and very informative clear possibilities for implementation
i really enjoyed this book it was a few good laughs over a few good dumps what else can a goomba ask from a book sittin' on the back of the cammode
i found lovemaps a valueable and insightful look at the way individuals relate to sexual behavior and establish their sexual identify and desires based on life experiences which as dr money indicates occurs in childhood and which is unconsciously formed by the individual i found this book extremely helpful while working on my doctorate in human sexuality and now 6 years later as i continue my research and work as a sexologist and sex therapist i highly recommend this book to other sexologist and clinicians , as well as any man or woman who is interested in learning more about sex and sexual behavior and in essence more about themselves it definitely helps if you read a book before judging it and this book should be in everyone 's sensual library live with passion , dr charley ferrer , author of the latina kama sutra , the w i s e journal for the sensual woman , para la mujer sensual , el kama sutra latino , the passionate latina in our own words www instituteofpleasure org
the art of the table a complete guide to table setting , table manners , and tableware , is extremely thorough in covering all the details related to proper table etiquette author suzanne von drachenfels makes it so easy , and entertaining in the process , finding the answer to any mealtime dilemma
wells wrote the time machine \( 1895 \) rather furiously it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel , summing it up in a tightly constructed , very short novel most works that i have read from the nineteenth century are long winded , purple toned , velvet like effluviums this one is short and for once i would have liked a book a bit wordier
rose madder was one the first books that got me hooked on stephen king this story is phenomenal , in my opinion i have to admit the first time i read it i was a little confused i was not one to be to much into sci fi fantasy type stuff this , like any good story or movie is best when it is read a few times then you really get to pick up the subtle hints that you may have missed before then again i am a bit biased rose madder is right at the top of my list of most favorites \( just below bag of bones
i picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading instead i was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until i 'd read most of it the main character , in my opinion , is janet , the mother i think it 's more or less in her voice , and that is why she is the most developed character

wow ! ! ! this is a ton of great information from a 'been there , done that' mom and grandma
i got my copy of the five keys to value investing as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor he thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before i start my career on wall street i was not disappointed the five keys is a very good summary of what i learned in business school and much , much more the author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like buffett and graham the experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile but what makes this book very special is the framework i have read several investment books over the years , but none like this one putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw in addition , reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work the clarity in the concepts and the conversation like tone was particularly attractive to me in sum , this is a very coherent , practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective considering the authors' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing
when i first started reviewing children 's books on amazon com i gave myself a long list of rules to follow and one of those rules stated that i was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until after i 'd written my own review i wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure , filled only with my own thoughts \( which i obviously mistook to be brilliant \) and feelings after a while though i gave up on this rule by and large \( and this is not speaking for all reviews just 90 of them \) a review for a children 's book goes something along the lines of it was good , my four year old requests it every night , buy this book , etc nothing too shocking or revealing so i grew lazy i started reading other reviews of picture books long before i sat down to actually write a review of my own just moments ago i went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book , martin 's big words this book was on my list of must reads because it had garnered itself a caldecott honor years before so i went to the appropriate amazon com page \( much as you are now \) and read the first review on the list at the time , it was an unassuming july 18 , 2002 review entitled , there 's something wrong here i read the review i digested the review and i came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones ones that i should consider , dare i say , in my own review this is unprecedented never has a review for a book , a children 's book , really hit home for me like this one did so to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002 , i commend you and to myself , a mental whipping for breaking my own rules it 's a hard act to follow , but i 've a point or two of my own to make and i'm gonna make `em
i loved this book i love it so much , i want to give copies to my sisters , my friends and to get my husband to read it the ideas seem so simple and straight forward , that when you read it , you say of course , i can do that in my life

ibn batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native tangiers \( morocco \) in the 14 c by avoiding to travel the same route twice , he comes to the same places a number of times \( baghdad , delhi \) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas as he explores with brio this world , he unfolds himself and as in most cross cultural encounters , this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book he accepts miraculous events with a candor i have not found in any other middle age traveler of those lands \( from marco polo to the jesuits \) he gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits which i regret apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the sheikhs of the places he visits the descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how \( extremely \) fragile power was and is in those regions
i lived in a situation somewhat like that richardson describes we watched vietnam from 1000 miles away , but the players were the same it was like living at the far edge of the welsh marches in the time of the roman empire maybe if you have n't lived within a bureauocracy you wo n't understand , but everything he says is true
a must for any afterlife library the chapter entitled mothers chapter is worth the price of the book alone i know it will be hard to put this book down a delightful 2 day read
there are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade , but at least in terms of the international movement of capital , you 'll usually find mere boosterism and ideology at last , paul blustein has given us a look at the real life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation here we have an in depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of argentina 's economy in 2001 2002 , which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship you wo n't be surprised to see the word bubble regularly , as blustein covers the surprisingly slow moving factors that added up to disaster over several years , with many mistakes made by all parties along the way

i found this book to very informative in a nutshell , it tells you how food is processed throughout your system and it 's reaction like , fresh vegatables can be eaten with anything but starches do n't digest well with meat there are stages to going raw that ms rose has honestly and clearly put out there our bodies just ca n't go raw over night yhere is a change in the digestive system i know from my experience how my body feels when i eat raw for several days and then introduce the wrong combonation of foods i feel like i'm suffering at the toilet sorry natalie gets you through the stages of developing this life style it 's a detox program not a cookbook it has recipes for all the stages to going raw ms rose hershelf claims it took several years for her to go completely raw the recipes are for those various stages i do n't find anything wrong with this book as far as enzymes all foods have them , and yes our body has them too when cooking foods you are breaking down the enzymes that are packed with nutrients that simple we want to incorporate more enzymes or natural living food into our bodies
i enjoyed this novel it was n't hiaasen 's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read
only about two hundred pages , jonathan spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful , mysterious , fascinating , and frightening persons of the twentieth century though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of mao 's life or policies , it is best to look elsewhere this book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of mao 's life and work and ideas perfect for people curious about mao and twentieth century china who want to read more than an abstract , but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work just the facts and little commentary spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences
this book opened up new database opportunities for me without it , i would never have unlocked the real power of mysql 5

through forster 's impressive command of the english language and advanced character development , the story of helen margaret schlegel unfolds the sisters who are highly educated , pensive , and artistic become entangled with the wilcox family practical , unilateral capitalists and the basts working class and unassuming however , the initially subtle differences between the sisters \( and how they approach love , misfortune , and personal relations \) become more obvious as the novel progresses , climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high brow english novel \( i think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end \) human nature notwithstanding , the novel 's refinement , gorgeous writing , and riveting story telling prevail to the end i loved it !

i just finished my second reading of it
i first read this extraordinary book in 1986 , just two years after it was first published picking it up again , i find it eerily applicable to our current situation there is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it the march of folly brings this message back to the forefront
when my sunday school teacher gave us the challenge of reading through the bible in a year , i thought it was going to be hard so i started looking for a one year bible when i came across this one i was really excited it is by far my favorite traslation because it is so easy to read i can get through the daily reading in about 15 20 minutes it breaks down the hard to read old testament into easy reading and one of the best parts is that it breaks down the reading by day , so you are not constantly going back and forth between the books truely one of the best bibles i have purchased ! ! !
many stories in this book reminds me of the famous essay silent spring the writing style is extremely accessible to every body and yet delivers a significant amount of knowledge , advice , and sometimes wisdom the author carefully explains medical terms and implications , thus easing the reader 's mind without using a medical book this book is highly recommended to anyone who has a curious mind
kate white introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel over her dead body
as a health writer , i know that pharmaceuticals can be very dangerous compounds but for years , i overlooked the fact that drugs are n't good for pets either your cat can probably benefit from safer alternative treatments martin zucker has put together a wonderful book with top veterinarians do n't keep alternative and holistic treatments to yourself share them with your pet
i loved this book ! i read it in a single day i have read everything else of maupin 's and strongly recommend this novel , too this is probably my favorite book of his
'the regulators' is not quite on the literary level of 'desperation , ' but that makes it more fun in a way , especially as it 's less preachy i liked that 'the regulators' adds a little more information about the mysterious tak here we see a more terribly playful , oddly fastidious , and possibly younger tak who loves spaghetti , chocolate milk , westerns , and cassie stiles and while most of the characters of 'the regulators' are flatter than those of 'desperation , ' 'the regulators' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of desperation might have been like before tak possessed them , particularly audrey and collie who were never shown pre tak in 'desperation
a looming 21 year high school reunion has led me to ponder the past , especially the town i grew up in i have been reading the geography of nowhere by james howard kuntsler , a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in america kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy \( le corbusier , gropius , bauhaus etc \) although kunstler 's book is by no means a complete history , his insights are provocative his basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless geography of nowhere in other words , since the 1920s , americans have pursued a single minded vision when it comes to urban development namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold , with little regard to aesthetics
very few books can weave the historical narrative with an account of the subject as mr derbyshire does it in this book whats more , he does total justice to the subject by making sure persons who should get their credit does atleast so the author 's canvas is huge and he almost reminded me of how much i missed undergraduate math
extremely well researched mcchesney has been a key figure in the media debate and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity his disciplined , almost scientific investigation is an example of non partisan coverage of a crucial issue if only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as mcchesney , we would be in a better world i am a mexican citizen so i could n't care less about u s partisan politics , and if you care about the fate of public communications , you should n't either this is a problem that affects every country , not just the u s a , since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the world the interest of big advertisers is being protected by u s policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere even the smallest community in the south mexican jungles knows ronald mcdonald cnn has latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most latin countries as an outsider , i hope the u s citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of democrats vs republicans but a world wide issue of the individual vs the big corporations in reality they do n't care about your political affiliations , as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products , you can debate each other to death
woodward and bernstein , famous reporters for the washington post during the watergate scandal , chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of president nixon and his cronies during watergate this book takes the reader through woodward and bernstein 's efforts at uncovering the truth , internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering , and covert meetings with confidential sources they tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world 's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the us presidency was respected above all else
a lot of the reviews i have read here , both positive and negative , have noted smith 's acerbic and sometimes hostile tone in my own discussions on god , particularly when engaging christians , i probably would not use some of the more harsh language found in the book it tends to be devisive and unproductive , and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to atheists
golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies , especially in this novel and in the inheritors \( 1955 \) , on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology the central symbol of the lord of the flies is that of a pig 's head upon a stick stuck in the ground , a totem in the making perhaps , but seen by golding as beelzebub , the lord of the flies , the devil , a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies
a lot of these reviews say that they 've read this book and it 's done wonders for them and everyone they 've recommended it to the book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things gawain suggests it 's not a miracle cure all book it 's about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you i read this book in college when i was going through a little bit of a rough patch , figuring out what i wanted , etc now that i 've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world , i need more positivity in my life so i'm re reading it in the hopes that i can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again i highly recommend it to those who are open minded enough to give it a chance
not only a terrific portrait of louis b mayer , but a wonderful history of hollywood movie making my caveat is the portrait of dore schary while eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between mayer and thalberg , eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the mayer schary conflict in the last part of the book , possibly to correct the view of mayer the monster and schary the savior in earlier mayer bios his portrait of schary , a man i knew , bears no resemblance to that decent , fair minded , and gifted man it is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of schary eyman claims that schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals , yet schary in his post mgm days produced a successful musical , the unsinkable molly brown whatever good flims came from mgm during schary 's reign are dismissed as the work of others he creates a portrait of schary as a talentless hack , forgetting not only the good films schary wrote in earlier days but the successful broadway play he wrote about fdr , sunrise at campabello he writes that schary only spoke of himself in retirement i knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends if he can get schary so wrong , it forces me to question his other judgments having said all that , i think this is a fine book , evoking old hollywood with grace and style
if you are planning a trip to italy , this is a book you should take with you
wow i had to have this book they are right , he explains everything wrong with oracle and all about vulnerabilities and exploits
as soon as people see breton 's name on a book , they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim , the dictator of surrealism ! what they do n't seem to realize is that , despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man , he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body nadja is simply one more delightful proof of breton 's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal , the mysterious , the mystical , and everything that is profoundly divergent in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly , clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja , which is the russian word for hope the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma , things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her at the end of the novel , nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior , some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton 's , and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end it may be true that breton 's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate \( she died of cancer , insane and completely alone \) is indeed nothing to admire , but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her , he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before , and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity , even while the second world war raged and reaped it 's devastating results universally on all of mankind , to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence , however 'absurd' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism , but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism' , the philosophical justification of human misery , at all costs can only call forth our admiration his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct , concrete experience of life as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow , our inner lives \( hopefully \) become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible do n't be fooled by the 'anti breton' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him , because you 'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books \( to my mind \) ever written
this is one of the most insightful books i 've ever come across the author is simply a genious embracing the principles of this book may be the difference between developing a successful business or not

nicholas nickleby is a significant dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses the protagonist 's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama , comic relief , political satire , class comedy , social criticism , and domestic farce , they allow dickens the opportunity to portray , to the minutest nuance , an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics the main frame of nicholas nickleby is a quintessential dickens a generic , virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate nicholas nickleby has committed no fault and offenses , and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world , to be separated from the people he loves , and to be proscribed like a criminal the more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life , the more profusely the novel accentuates dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice
this book is highly informative , updated to include everything up to around hero 's trial \( new jedi order \) , which makes it a must even if you already have the more presentable star wars encyclopedia while the encyclopedia has more interesting and fact filled entrys , it 's also hideousely out of date , a problem that this one would easily correct ! i read it cover to cover in a few days , and was quite impressed with how much research went into it , and how few errors were made even so , i have to say i 'd recommend this book mainly to fans experienced with eu stuff , lest they quickly become lost and overwhelmed

the reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded the conversations in the book are intelligent , the characters and dialogue are real , and the descriptions and settings are vivid while the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon yale and new haven , it is sometimes hard to believe , especially given that the author has been a faculty member at yale law school for over twenty years this is not to say , however , that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate rather , they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university \( yale \) and those that are not

i 'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here but i would like to say that i do n't have much time for reading , so make sure the books i choose are those by authors i consider 5 star j d robb a k a nora roberts is one of the most prolific authors i 've ever read how she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination i 've read this series out of order , but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone this one , however , revealed to me the reason behind eve 's sometimes belligerent attitude , her strong persona , and standoffishness robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts , inner turmoils great book

one of the best new authors to date , and possibly one of the best writers in the history of the english language ! jasper has a very firm grasp of the language and creates a slightly twisted version of reality where people jump into books , fictional characters jaunt around the real world \( hamlet \) and books have a tendancy to re write themselves characters include jane eyre \( of course \) , the cheshire cat , the red queen , hamlet , and a slew of minor personalities from books out of print \( for good reasons \) if you like puns , you 'll love this series
i loved the four agreements by don miguel ruiz , in which he
simon winchester is a popular historian , in the modern mold this means that he 's socially and politically a liberal , and that he 's interested in everything connected with a specific event he 'll examine it from all angles , and attempt to see it from everyone 's eyes , look over everything connected with it , and then draw some conclusions usually , those conclusions over reach some \( i'm being general about this type of writer , not of winchester specifically \) and the point of view is relentlessly modern
this is truely a funny book it of course is the origin of the ma and pa kettle movies , yet much more i like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle when you read it , you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were , although , it is a good read on that level too , i e seeing were our culture has been and where it is today i did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work good grief folks , lighten up read the thing for what it is a funny story meant to amuse when i was a kid , i did not read micky mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness , nor social commentary \( although , being a dog lover , i was not always happy how pluto was presented and treated \) nor did i compair the micky of 1949 to the micky of 1952 anyway , digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine i suppose , if you are into such , but for me , i just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it

i liked this prep guide because it 's not one of those huge books that 's impossible to fit in your carry on or laptop bag if you 're traveling it has enough information to pass the test , which is good enough for me because that 's all i needed to pass the test this month but , if you 're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right , this is not the book for you the book does n't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam , just enough to pass it the only draw back to this book is that it does n't come with a cd with a comprehensive set of sample test questions i had to go to one of those huge books that i bought a couple of years ago for that , but i did n't read the huge book

citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man , thorby , as he matures from boy to man starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar , baslim , we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom , though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men' the society he paints here is vivid and believable \( though the economics of slavery in a star travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me \) baslim is far more than he appears to be , and puts thorby through a rigorous education , both academic and practical how do you become a really good beggar \? here heinlein falls in with ayn rand whatever you do , do it to the best of your ability , from begging to juggling also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums these are items that may pass over young readers' heads , but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined , nothing should be accepted on 'faith' , that personal integrity is more important than 'success' , that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action
written all the way back in the mid 1980s , long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the us today , this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient i feel like i would have had a much better understanding of this subject \( not to mention appreciation of the people involved \) had i discovered it a long time ago , but i suppose late is better than never

many people remember the battle of midway as the turning point of the war in the pacific due to the sinking of four japanese aircraft carriers , and rightly so but would the american success at midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons \? probably not in this eye opening account of the battle , author alvin kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who , flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes , cleared the way for the sbd dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the japanese carriers

part geology , part biography , part history of scotland , this excellent book is a tribute to james hutton , the originator of modern geology starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth , the author weaves the intriguing story of james hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth 's true antiquity the political situation in eighteenth century scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which hutton lived but the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after hutton 's death is also discussed , ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them this is a very well written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience

kenneth pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of iran from the rise of the persian empire to the reign of the pahlavis \( pp 3 100 \) pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic iran got wary of meddling foreigners , starting with the hated russians and brits , in its domestic affairs \( pp 4 , 41 \) many iranians have angry psychological scars , believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons \( pp 26 , 71 , 89 , 99 , 125 , 128 , 155 56 , 161 , 173 74 , 242 , 297 , 389 \)

lords of the earth is the term the yali warriors use to describe themselves they live in the heluk valley in irian jaya , and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains the first section of the book is about them , their customs , and the awful fear and darkness they lived in don richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin , and longing for release the horror of their pain is graphic , and not suitable to be read to younger children
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking , which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it , i read it as a novel , for entertainment years later , i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading , i was able to examine the russian names , characters , events , and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog , which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going , which it certainly is , but in it , tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence , each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space , with one atom colliding at random with another , but when a sufficient number act in concert , such as napoleon 's invasion of russia , their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar , he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom , who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self deluding as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms , then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature this one tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one or any other deity , but he does say that history , time , and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path , and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go , then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov , who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going
add this reviewer to the list of people who hold paradise lost up to the lofty title of the greatest epic poem in the english language it is not only this , but one of the best in any language writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed homeric epic verse , mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by homer , virgil , and dante but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work the opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by homer , as are other elements , but milton has a very unique poetic style long sentences , often with the principle verb at the end , being one of its mainstays this language is very grandiose and quite complex it takes a while to get used to it you will have to pay very close attention during the first book but , as with most classical literature , once the reader gets the hang of it , it goes quite smoothly the divine comedy of dante has a more towring reputation than does milton 's paradise lost for one thing , it is older but i among those who find milton to be superior the divine comedy is , certainly , an undisputed masterpiece , but , where it was , more or less , a satire and a thinly veiled attack on many of dante 's political enemies , milton 's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter why mankind fell , how the gods themselves operate and think , the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin , the importance of love in human relationships , the moral problems of god 's justice it is true that dante 's work is more original paradise lost and paradise regained , at least in seed , come straight from the bible but milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective strictly within the christian tradition , to be sure , but far from fundamentalist , and even quite radical for its day although some cite the work as christian apologist , there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard line christians would be taken aback by it was , of course , even more controversial in its day one thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than god this , in my view , does not have milton unwittingly on the devil 's side , as some critics have suggested rather , he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is of course it 's interesting , of course it 's appealing otherwise , we would n't keep falling for it again and again and again if we saw its razor sharp fangs and dripping mouth , we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago however , as a non christian myself , i cannot but disagree with some points of milton 's theodicy the last two books , in particular , and paradise regained as a whole , were , for me , quite hard to swallow i found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing milton paints adam and eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share joy , happiness , fear , sadness , depression , and , most of all , the overriding paramount importance of love the act of adam , who was not himself evil , eating of the apple so that he could follow eve , no matter what doom was to befall her and them , out of love for her , is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature as mark twain , in the voice of adam , later said , wheresoever eve was there , there was eden god , satan , and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics most christians today seem to have forgotten that god created man in his own image , and that he is not a perfect creature likewise , satan is not entirely evil certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic , but so are many humans indeed , many have seen him as the hero of the poem \( an errorenous view , as i see it \) god often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful indeed , to many readers , myself included , this poem does n't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of gods to men , but only reinforces the views we already had \( mark twain , whom i have previously mentioned , has a very different view of the situation , closer to my own perspective , that is worth seeking out \) whatever one 's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem , the poem remains a great work of literature poetic , grandiose , profound , extremely readable , and thought provoking the shorter sequel , paradise regained , is also included in this edition this work , in my view , comes nowhere near the glory of it 's predecessor , but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well for that reason , i highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works also because the introduction , written by dr susanne woods , is very good , and it has notes provided by the wonderful christoper ricks , who also edited the poem for this version unlike many editors , he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them this is an absolute classic not only of english literature , but of world literature , and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read
for someone totally unfamiliar with authorware , i thought this book rather confusing i typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises however , i knew authorware was pretty complex so i thought this book would help well , it did help a little but overall i became quite frustrated with following the book 's exercises as i use authorware i imagine i 'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool but until then , i 'll content myself with playing on my own
patton describes qualitative research design and data collection methods in a way that even the novice researcher can easily understand and utilize
i bought this cookbook due to the introductory price i received and have loved every recipe i have tried many of the recipies are heart healthy and i have found those to be tasty and easy to prepare good luck and good cooking
harvey is a totally spoiled boy it starts when harvey is on a ship with his mother \( i forget where they are going \) he is washed overboard , and saved by a fisherman `manuel ' on the fishing boat harvey makes his first friend , learns to work for his keep and so on the story worked , it was n't cheesy , maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type , but the plot of harvey growing up seemed just to be there so you will read the book the characters were well developed except the cook , you never really figure out where he is coming from most of the book was about fishing of the grand banks , very interesting is you like fishing and ships , but if you are reading it for the story , there is not that much , the ending was also weak , we are happy the harvey is reconciled , but i really think that his parents would make a bigger stink good historical value , kipling is a very enjoyable writer , yes i liked it but the plot had some flaws i do recommend it though
i loaned my copy of dr streicher 's book to my mother who thought she may need a hysterectomy my mother reported that dr streicher 's book had information on topics she could n't find elsewhere even about laparoscopic procedures which she had n't heard about before dr streicher 's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor fortunately , it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy my only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother i may need to purchase a new one i think it is a must have for any woman 40 even for men whose partners spouses girlfriends are facing this
i was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and i found it surprisingly helpful by filling out a basic personality inventory , this book will tell you what style of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other styles i see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday but i can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment if you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior , this book gives you the skills to build great relationships i agree , however , with the previous reviewer 's comments that this book does not go very deep , thus only 4 stars do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this , but you can make your day to day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics \( this is also an easy read took me 2 days !
this book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago i own and have read about twelve books on the topic out of all of them , this has been by far the best by the end it feels like a journey inside yourself has taken place and you arrive to a new destination on your insides the feel of the book is one of love and support not the self centered type , or author as guru type that i have read in other books this one has the experience of two professional therapists that shows itself in each chapter it made a large difference in my struggle with an eating disorder that started at age 10 i am now 44
classic book is great in dribble proof format with good reproductions of the original illustrations lots of squirming and hugging while reading this one
tapscott and ticoll have written another very detailed , practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely at the heart of the naked corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster , which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge in other words , perhaps the old adage there 's one born every minute needs updating they 're still being born , but hopefully now only a few per hour \? corporations getting naked ca n't be good news for marketing departments their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image companies and products must be the image for real yikes david brett , founder , knexa
i read this book , loved it , and now want to make a movie of it there is a local town that has a college , churches , and the overall atmosphere of the town i felt like i was reading about it while i was going through the book
i bought this book to learn some simple things to fold in a kindergarten i used to work in , and it was an instant success ! i was sat at the table for hours folding frogs and boats to the kids , and they seemed to really enjoy the creations ! this is a great book for parents and pre school teachers , and it is a great way to learn a little bit about geometry too some of the models are difficult to understand , but folding is about taking your time a great way of finding a corner of peace in our rush hour lifestyle
whitman is not the world 's greatest poet that 's probably shakespeare but he 's certainly been the most influential american poetic voice over the past century he was the first poet to take all of american life as his subject ever the romantic , whitman was also the first poet to bring romanticism into line with everyday reality
i have been an information systems professional for several years now and i am happy to see that there is finally a focus on data as the asset it truly is if i could put certified data on the balance sheet as a separate line item , i would i have been reading your book improving data warehouse and business information quality over the past several weeks and i have this ear to ear grin that some peers find disturbing \( why does he get so excited about data \? \) high quality data success
os guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply this book is no exception the fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section
this book brings some of the items one read about in history classes to a more 'back channel' perspective monroe doctrine and the like are the opening situations , and instead of 'we put a blockade on german ship' it goes it to some of the things that happened to stop a war from breaking out
i grew up reading and rereading this book , as did all the five children in my family it 's one of the very funniest books i know on the subject of families and their foibles shirley jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when i recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor once you read this you must also read raising demons , which is the sequel , and every bit as good , although much harder to find
read on if you are

for most of us , the area of thanatology is something quite new , despite the fact that death is such an intimate companion that can come at any moment of our lives , whether by degrees or instantaneously , irrelevant of our ethnic , social and economic backgrounds it is a plain truth that can not be avoided , and no technological advancements can make it go away i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you , despite what your feelings may be and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier , the adult must equally do so with death , not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means the total cessation of physical life , for if one denys its existence and its inevitability , the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache , but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental , spiritual and religious grief as well submission to and acceptance of the truth , no matter how difficult it would be to hear , could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing in elizabeth kubler ross 's classic study of the dying process , she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person , the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all hence , how do you take the sting from the wound \? in on death and dying , you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say , to let them vent , and at their own pace , go through the classic defined stages of the dying process denial and isolation , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance the patients become our teachers we learn of their fears , their possible financial burdens , in one woman 's case , the fear of the worms , et cetera but we also learn about what the families go through , their own anger and disbelief and guilt it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger , other times not the united states is one of the most death denying countries out there , a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process , for going foward means only one thing death ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is , the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe death has issues for everybody , doctors , faith filled people , even ross heself it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together
i enjoyed robert webber 's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well at a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the fate of the church in america so much commodification has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be ecclesia \? although i agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church \( the lutheran church missouri synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy the church body which webber received his doctorate from \) , my question is are we truly called to change the church in order to meet the people where they are at \?
i find it difficult to rate and review parenting books with such specific agendas , such as the continuum concept i fear that alone this book would render a nervous , new mother terrified of failure ! i am wary of books that pretend there is only one way to raise every child that said , i adore text that encourages instinctual , intuitive parenting coupled with the dozens of other parenting guides i have read \( from all spectrums \) , the continuum concept is a very valuable book
it is quite rare that a book appears that is this good but this book is so good that even men \( i am male \) can \( i e should \) enjoy it a groundbreaking , unabashedly feminist \( wo \) manifesto , the vagina monologues has given voice to countless women in the past ten years , and has ushered in a new era of sexual liberation if you are still incredulous , ask yourself how many books published hitherto so much as had the word 'vagina' , let alone all the facts thereabout in it \? a wonderful book
for those who love historical texts , but sometimes have a hard time weeding thru the period language , overly technical jargon and miles of microfiche , this book is a real blessing the author not only deals with the methods of tracking , chasing and boarding prey , but goes happily in depth about the people who follow the sweet trade he covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea , the events leading up to their rise in influence in the caribbean , and goes into clothing , food , religion , heirarchy , weapons , flags , choice of ships and cultural relationships
with the hype over the da vinci code and its related popularity , you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with dan brown of course , this is not the case , as brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers probably the biggest in the bunch was robert ludlum , but not to be forgotten is jon land not quite the big name that ludlum or brown , land is nonetheless the most pure fun , with outlandish plots and tons of action
i made 4 dishes from the book for my girlfriends and all of the recipes were a huge hit the carmelized onion and spinach dip was amazing as well as the tomato and ginger soup i especially like the 'buy and arrange' features which give you clever stylish ideas for easy dishes to throw together if you do n't have alot of time no more 3 course meals for me , i'm going all appetizers
note to reviewers the title of the book was a play on hillary claiming that there was a vast right wing conspiracy against her husband in the monica scandal she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy \( right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything \)
devoted entirely to coming to amazon to trash conservative books \? i see the same names here i saw for kate o'bierne 's book , tony blankley 's book , michelle malkin 's books , david limbaugh 's books you get the idea and most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing , too you 'd think some of you would aim for creativity , especially when you 're accusing republicans of being mindless automatons
a moving and inspiring portrait of men most people will never know about but will always be remembered by those touched by their deeds and courage in places we do n't remember much anymore i am thankful for the sacrifice they made so i could freely write this
since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story \( huge lawsuit against a hospital suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor \) i 'll simply leave a brief comment although the story is n't all that complicated , it was still a quick , enjoyable read and the ending was one i did n't see coming please be aware , though , that the 5th horseman is not an alex cross novel , which seemed to be one reviewer 's complaint this is the story of lindsay boxer , sfpd lieutenant and her fellow women 's murder club friends i found the story to be heartfelt and emotional , full of action adventure , and , as i said , a very quick , satisfying read

as a parent , child and family therapist and school counselor i have seen positive discipline concepts change the lives of parents and children alike we are all searching for a way to raise our children that allows them to develop the long term life skills of confidence , responsibility , contribution and the ability to solve problems the schools that teach these skills in addition to academics have students that perform better in school and in life using positive discipline will actually save you time in the classroom , and make your job and relationships with your students much more enjoyable

i have long been aware of the commercial success of author nora roberts but the storylines and writing style \( a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance \) have never tempted me to read any of her work however , i happened to pick up a copy of volume 21 \( depending on how you count anthology inclusions \) in the in death series written under the pen name j d robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series \( the year is 2058 \) with a strong central character \( detective lieutenant eve dallas \) who had a continuing romantic interest \( the mysterious irish billionaire roarke \) i have long enjoyed the spenser series by robert parker and the ensemble cast of ed mcbain 's 87th precinct novels the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of new york city , an area very familiar to me i was immediately hooked by survivor in death and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review \( 3 30 2005 \) i read origin in death , the next book in the series , as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well \( 7 26 2005 \) as with other series which i have enjoyed , i then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved
this is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself this makes it a largely indispensable supplement , handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism this is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated , and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear the reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as renan , max weber and stalin \( although the views of marx and engels themselves or lord acton and friedrich meinecke would have been welcome additions \) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars \( gellner , anderson , connor , a smith , etc \) the texts are well selected and organized , and it really contributes to making a very complex subject and a daunting field of scholarship seem a little easier to grasp
if you are just starting out on photography , i highly recommend this book it begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making ! for this reason alone , i would give it 5 stars here in the first chapter , the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures the photographer , not the equipment they then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures \( at least , the rest of us non professionals \) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high tech cameras
if you are ready to take complete responsibility for yourself and live the joyful life then this is a must read i will say it is simple even thou i will avoid saying it is easy for your sake and your loved ones sake give this idea a go

this story , set early in the known space period , is an important part of larry niven 's future universe , full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science the protectors do n't fit quite comfortably into the known space universe , and have raised some problems later , for example in the famous man kzin wars , where the known space universe has been shared by other writers , including poul anderson , jerry pournelle , sm stirling and hal colebatch , but the story is fine space opera and entertainment , and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary sf
i picked up this book looking at the cover trying to figure out his picture i then looked at the titleee and it clicked i read this for school and it was n't hard to finish it because it amazed me with what everything really was usually i read fiction books that have diseases or disorders in them i figured that there should be some explaination for me it wasnt hard to follow also everything was explained very well i did n't have any real background other than the fictions books that you really could n't go by
after viewing the german artistic mini series for television many years ago , i decided to read this german family story to rival galsworthy 's forsythe saga i was not disappointed , because this book deals , among others , with one essential aspect of human existence man 's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status the story of the buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who , although belong to the same family , can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality in this family we see characters who are able to adapt , understand the world and compromise , while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self abandon this fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature , two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings it is for this reason that buddenbrooks is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life , a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil
alan lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities as a result , he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science , especially physics none of the essays are ultra profound , but they 're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading , especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited this book reminds me of feynman 's rainbow by leonard mlodinow , which i also found to be very enjoyable and , like mlodinow 's book , lightman 's book is a quick read
it may sound as though i am damning this book with faint praise , but i believe that with a subject as complicated as anti western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener
okay , the title is a bit much but i enjoyed this book tremendously some of the criticisms point to the elements i liked best the routine cases , how they were approached , and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what i 've seen on cops \( constant action and crisis ! \) there was a new story on every page , and i wound up reading until 1 a m on a work day because i just could n't help reading one more page the descriptions of the surroundings , the characters , the sounds and smells of the settings , conjured up a real sense of being there i was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book , as atkinson tried to remain true to mccain 's philosophy that most people are n't entirely good or bad as a resident of the area , i finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when i was growing up \( i remember the old boston record american newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front \) i highly recommend this book to anyone who lives in the northeast , and to others who 'd like a glimpse into how boston politics are practiced in every profession
i could n't help myself when i opened the juicing bible i should have been doing other things but i spent over an hour perusing the pages it contains a wealth of information on fruits , herbs , and vegetables and their healing properties the layout is handy and it is easy to find things with the detailed indices the recipes are simple , clearly written , and sound delicious i am excited and inspired in fact , i'm going to get my juicer off of the bottom shelf of the pantry and go for it

michael farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history loving set this one , treasury of deception , is just what it 's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds , from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes , such as the blood libel it is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites , although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once the book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and , amazingly enough , never veers into the truly silly , which is a blessing
this was an amazing book it was one of those where when you read it , you can picture the story in your head , almost movie like feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement this was my first fiest book , but i can guarantee you , it wont be my last
i think nora roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms , as we 've seen in her books irish thoroughbred , irish rebel and now true betrayals which was written in 1996 unlike the other two , true betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres to me , it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours

i was recommended this book after having taken a body electric workshop a few weeks before from the first page i began to re live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend how to connect , how to communicate , and how to intimately bond on a higher plane ! although some of the prose is repetitive , it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from a definite must have book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally

i always look to see if an author stands in their truth if they walk their talk dr christiane northrup does i have read all of her books , women 's bodies , women 's wisdom , the wisdom of menopause and now mother daughter wisdom they all embody her path to well being and her knowledge on the subject of women 's health in her book mother daughter wisdom , she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness i find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother daughter relationship i have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up i found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters dr northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship she addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way she talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter this book is also a reference book as dr northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter 's life mothers , men , and women without children , would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter
as the authors state in the preface of the book , the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts this is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract , but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions , then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate
this book is a must have for anyone applying six sigma to real world problems not only do i use it on a nearly daily basis , i'm finding that my engineers are embracing the terminology and concepts so clearly conveyed in this text we 're spending 20 minutes at each staff meeting to review topics from basic statistics to advanced application of teaming concepts to get results instead of the usual soft stuff application examples that seem to illustrate that the author thinks everyone 's making clothes pins , pyzdek 's book shows that he 's really lived this stuff i highly recommend this book to anyone serious about applying six sigma for results
this book is an almost encylocpedic digest of current theories of thoroughbred handicapping none are covered in such detail that you can run off and start making money at the track , but each points you to a source for more comprehensive information on the theory that interests you

this is a very involved book , bringing to light all the past and present characters i loved it it was nice to see the history of o'connor and his mentor jack i thought ms burke pulled this one off nicely with the mystery being spread over a 40 yr timeframe nice job it was nice to see new characters introduced also , i hope to see them in future books if you have n't read this series , you could probably get away with starting out with this book i have to tell you though that you are missing a lot by not reading all of the other books in the irene kelly series
once again , david mccullough 's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind this biography reads like a fascinating novel , and mcculloughs narrative ability is unmatched no one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can
i religiously read all of baldacci 's books he ca n't write them fast enough for me and this is one of his best ! i 'd give it 10 stars if i could

i am an inveterate map reader whenever i travel there is a map in my pocket but a recent trip to the middle east and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as i tried to put in context the ruins visited and the coins i collected with time , the names of cities and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period morkot 's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps , but the rationale and context for their evolution and change one of the best features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview , followed by a series of in depth accounts , each from the perspective of the important players during a given historical period this approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the same information is repeated and new information added as each of the regions , their politics and battles , are succesively presented from the mycenae to the parthians are thousands of years , thousands of miles , and thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of influence affect us even today for the first time after years of puzzling over strange grecian place names and leaders , i am now able to begin to understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the birth of christ i wish this had been the first book i read in my study of ancient history i can hardly wait to start on penguin 's sequel acient rome

this book is full of useful insights i was fortunate to hear reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals while some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic , i doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business i applied his methodology to my business \( direct selling \) and had over 6 , 000 interviews completed to identify promoters , passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors consistent with reichheld 's findings , the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics from the detailed findings , we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business buy the book have an open mind apply the concepts he has laid out if you do , you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
this series of books is a beast that has possessed me with its great storylines , characters and cliffhanger endings kudoes to lahaye

truman capote 's wrote the grass harp early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem this sweet , eccentric , moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared , closeness is established , and love blooms think flannery o'connor meets swiss family robinson with a dash of steel magnolias themes of finding one 's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative it has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth primary assets are the thick as molasses southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters
the big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex few of us ever wake up to the mental prison cells that society has put us in and fewer still escape anne lamott 's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating once you get past this junk , you begin to see you do n't really need books telling you how to write at all you just need to write
this is my favorite kid 's book and i 've read a lot of books to my four year old ! the illustrations are simply wonderful and the story is great it just begs you to use funny voices as you read i buy it as a gift for every birthday party

of all the articles and books of chomsky that i have read , necessary illusions thought control in democratic societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched \( and footnoted \) , the most logically structured , and the most convincing chomsky reminds us that the majority of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their information about political affairs both domestic and foreign one can only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic so take , for example , the popular myth of the 'persistent soviet vetoe' at the un during the cold war why do people believe the ussr was constantly vetoeing any and every security council resolution \? simple ! when they did , it generated front page condemnation when the us or the uk exercised their right of veteo silence as chomsky notes , during the years of 1970 and 1989 the former soviet union veteod 8 resolutions the us veteod some 56 this is what chomsky refers to as thought control unless the public examine the factual record of the un themselves , they will never come by this information , \( at least not in the mainstream press \) so although chomsky 's title may appear somewhat paradoxical , or oxymoronic , a moments reflection on such facts shows it to be , in fact , extremenly pragmatic and truthful the question is , have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs \? the crux of chomsky 's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship chomsky points out that , in fact , propaganda is , contrary to popular postulations , more important and vital to a democratic society because people still have some rights that is , since people can talk , the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words come out of the peoples' mouths in a dictatorship it does not really matter too much what people think for whatever they may think , they have to do what they are told , by pain of death in countries such as the us \( and the uk \) other , more subtle , methods are required people often critisise chomsky for the sources of his information \( the copious footnotes \) no such critique can be levelled at this work chomsky 's sources are declassified internal planning documents , naval proceedings documents , and the very institutions he examines , new york times , washington post etc if there was one chomsky book i would suggest you to read , this would be it

pat was right ! anyone read the news lately \? bush has succeeded only in creating more terrorists mission accomplished buchanan may have some whacky views about illegal aliens , but he knows his foreign policy when it comes to warfare and economics if he and ralph nader did n't dislike eachother so much they would no doubt make the best running mates this country has seen in half a century

if you liked empire , you 'll love multitude the authors and reviewers alike speak of multitude as a follow up to empire , but i think something very different is happening here hardt and negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory , and in multitude they have attained a height depth of perception well beyond empire if you are attempting to learn your radicalism , or inform your progressivism , through hardt and negri , then you may see multitude as continuing from and expanding empire , and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books but what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book where empire was the best try we had at the time , multitude now succeeds where the digression in empire circled around the feeling of our world cultural hematopoiesis , the discursion in multitude captures it

this book was like madonna 's famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960 's this is brown 's manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era reader beware choices and actions have consequence and ponder very carefully before being cosmopolitan long after the expiration date living it up does not mean reckless behavior values are personal but when one woman 's values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another \( ie affairs with married men \) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others' heads people are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them although now dated and updated with sex and the city ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right helen gurley brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers , enjouing the single life , and having an identity but too much too long has a cost do you really want to be like brown and her counterpart hefner 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth \?

before the epiricist philosophers came along , it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning thus , complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic , working off what was assumed to be true then hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories relations of ideas and matters of fact relations of ideas are things that a true by defintion 2 2 will always equal 4 , because that is how it is defined try as we might , we can never successfully imagine 2 2 equalling 5 so relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world they are definitions we use to describe what is happening matters of fact , on the other hand , are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world , such as the sun will rise tomorrow morning unlike with relations of ideas , matters of fact are not true my their defintition we can imagine successfully the sun will not rise tomorrow how , then , if we can imagine the supposed impossible , do we know anything to be truly impossible \? hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry he effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true it was n't until kant 's critique of pure reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of hume 's metaphysics this is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers

i really enjoyed this book from beginning to end there are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share i am glad this story was n't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate for the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new it is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she 's lost i could read this novel over and over the deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage 's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail

we are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible ! without existing virtual technologies , compiling a complete collection of the new yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations , availability , and of course the daunting financial investment for the price of a modest concert , eighty years of intelligent discourse , satire , observation and fiction are all available i have nothing negative to say about this it does what it promises and does it well it still amazes me that i now have every issue of the new yorker , and look forward to the continuation of this extraordinary trend of publications releasing the entirety of their output

this is a must read book not just once , but many times each time you read it you understand and see a different view of the book one needs to read this book from the heart as the meaning of kokoro means from the heart the story of a married man , yet lonely why he feels guilty about the death of his best friend a scholar with no ambition , rich enough to enjoy a few simple things in life how he talks about the ending of his own life he is sure his wife will be taken care of after his death the student is confused i am confused read the book more than once each time you read , put yourself in each characters shoe written with passion , kokoro , from the heart is this book fiction or non fiction , you decide
jesse stone is sort of spenser 's alter ego he 's younger , and spenser 's never had a drinking problem , but other than that , they 're pretty much the same character , except stone 's about thirty years younger robert b parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now this is the fourth stone novel , there are 31 spenser novels , three featuring his third character , sunny randall , and nine books that are n't part of a series , some of them non fiction that 's 47 books , for those who are n't keeping up with the math obviously , by now parker knows what he 's doing he seems able to write one of these every six months or so he alternates between randall , spenser , and stone with ease , and just floats along
jane hirshfield and mariko aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity i had a friend who was a japanese scholar , who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka i have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called on japanese poetry and the process of translation i recommend it highly , even if you do not normally read this kind of essay
before reading this book , i 'd had a much more black and white \( sc , mostly black \) impression of jewish life in medieval and early modern europe this cogently writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture ghetto walls were an injustice , but also a refuge for many jews from the tense environment around them oddly enough , this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to christianity in the liberal west after the napoleonic liberations \( in contrast to the shtetl jews in poland and russia , who lived side by side with gentile neighbors \) katz 's discussions of of jewish martyrs during the first crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa , among other topics , are also quite fascinating
this is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject what happens at death , or near death \? it is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor and , in spite of the fact that i am a christian , with conservative beliefs , and even though i maintain my faith carefully focused on god , i do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence \( along with its companion , written subsequently , life beyond death \) i invite you to read it and see why
i actually enjoyed this book very much i was in a romance slump and needed something different well , i got it
h g wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent , world dominating british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way , particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world \( read colonize \) for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that attitude on a pedestal , and although he did n't knock it down , he made his point and in spectacular fashion in one way , the martians were the conquering british , with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the british despite their firm belief in their world destiny could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british \( or anyone else 's \) false boast of superiority in the end , though , it 's a hopeful book just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world , wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british \( alien \) way was not the native way of life in the colonies , suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that , it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense
this is the stupidest review i have read so far on this site the person who wrote it has no idea what they are talking about i seriously doubt they even considered reading the book \( i have n't but i 've been poor and i 've been on welfare \)
i just finished reading the hitorian the first 400 pages were so compelling , that i could hardly put it down then it became soooo boring it literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400 i just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head , thinking this has to get better , considering how good the first 2 3rd 's were
wendell jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat the verdict was suicide , but the insurance company that had sold him a half million dollar insurance policy is not convinced when 5 years passed , the company was forced to pay the premium to jaffe 's wife two months later , a man looking very much like jaffe is spotted in mexico the insurance company hires private investigator kinsey millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be jaffe , along with his girlfriend renata they escape kinsey 's surveillance and she returns to california jaffe 's son brian is in big trouble with the police and kinsey concludes that jaffe will return to help his son as she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with jaffe 's supposed widow and his two troubled sons she also comes in contact with some of her long lost family , and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them , and open up old wounds sue grafton can be relied on to provide a good read , and this book , although not the best in the series , is no exception
this is one of nora roberts' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite i adore this book the characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex husband what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances \( including roberts \) definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
as usual , robin cook keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end
i started the book last night , and could n't put it down until 4 am , but at least i finished it ! it was a good storyline , i enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world it also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general i really liked the characters in this book , although each one , in my opinion , could have used some more depth the only reason this book does n't get 5 stars is because as you read it you start to feel that the second half of the book lt with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book gt was completely rushed i really do n't like a sudden closing to a book however , it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages i just feel that it could have had more of an impact , and more of that umph had the story been written at the same speed throughout i do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read if you 're looking for something you will remember for life this is n't going to be it but if you 're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon by all means , try reading mary jane clark 's do you etc final word i believe her mother in law , the other clark , would be quite proud of her ex daughter in law the woman can write however , given her talents , i wish she would learn to write in her own style , instead of in the familiar style of the other clark
truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever ! were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh , this is the best medicine
reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that foucault points to profit and capitalism with the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than 'off with their head' or hands the panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like carnegie and rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by gps , social security cards , public schooling \( founded by the same industrial giants \) intellectual and psychological grading , job placement and conformity , credit ratings , licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom , a growing snitch culture foucault 's major thesis is that surveillance \( discipline \) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance as industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly every facet of modern society works to this end the irony is , as techno pundits like mccluhan later pointed out , in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order , where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication everything that stands in the way of the profit order , whether it be an idea , person , religion , or country is attacked bottom line , we are all 'human resources' in the political economy , in the religion of capital packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else the inanity and inherent fraud of our system , not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society , makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like foucault of all his books this is also the easiest read this is a beautiful book by a complicated man by the way , he taught at the university of buffalo for a short time
when i thought there were not any more sex techniques i could learn from a book , this book just amazed me combined with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed , this book can make you a better lover , husband or sex partner for sure
hannah arendt 's the origins of totalitarianism is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century , soviet communism and nazism , and traces their historical roots the book is divided into three volumes focusing on antisemitism , imperialism , and totalitarianism the first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of antisemitism arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of antisemitism for example , some historians have argued based on a scapegoat theory that the jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world 's ills arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the jews arendt explores the rise of antisemitism in the birth of the nation state , the emancipation of the jews , the rise of the jewish financiers , the roles of jews within society , and the infamous dreyfus affair of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as benjamin disraeli or the infamous forgery the protocols of the elders of zion the idea that the jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of antisemitism the second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of imperialism here , a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as count arthur de gobineau and various forms of social darwinism the role of the boers in south africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as cecil rhodes , who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic nordic elite , is made the great pan movements , pan slavism , pan germanism , and the pan arabism of t e lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored the final volume of this book is concerned with totalitarianism proper here , the role of propaganda and the secret police , as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in nazi germany and soviet russia arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent written during the cold war period and just after the second world war , this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as adolf hitler and josef stalin their movements of nazism and soviet communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished the book is important today not only for historical reasons , but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world
i found airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation i was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary \( i e the media \) that being said , i was not the least disappointed
i love this book i have read this book in three different languages \( german , english and french \) it 's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids ! this book has a lot of great quotes like
this is not the book for you if you 're impatient with precision and specifics if you want good results , you 'll do what michael recchiuti tells you to do you 'll buy the higher butterfat butter , you 'll use the scharffen berger or valrhona and chuck the hershey 's , and you 'll be so glad you did , because every recipe and i mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes i have tried from this book thus far has been fantastic
for those who have not read volume 1 , just get book 2 and get all the great information plus lots more being a born again christian , some of the dialogue is beyond my belief system , but just glean the book and keep the great stuff if your faith is well grounded , just look at this as a first class medical journal and forget the buddhist hogwash
if you 've been given this book , or recommended it by a friend then you 've been blessed this book is bizarre , yes , but if it finds its way to you i'm sure you wo n't be troubled by that minor detail thank you elisabeth haich , for this book it 's a gift i ca n't possibly explain in words the effect this book had on my life , nevermind fathom how the author used words to discuss topics which have traditionally defied discussion i still ca n't believe that this book actually exists , but i'm eternally thankful it does
ms roddick has managed to put together some important issues , outstanding commentators , and good information design in one place with this book i read it through from cover to cover \( i seldom do this \) and found myself both enlightened and inspired i recommend it highly
i 've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title , and i must strongly disagree malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches i have found to date in place of the term advanced in the title , a better word would be comprehensive nonetheless , malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight
i am from yazoo city so this book has always been one of my favorites i saw willie morris at a car wash in jackson , ms not long before his death i was shy and did n't want to bother him , so i did n't introduce myself and have a chat i would have loved to have spoken with him now i regret my shyness should 've taken the chance yazoo city has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories no matter where i live , it will always be home there is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever i drive into the city limits it is a feeling of home not many people have that sense of home these days i feel blessed to have grown up there
this play was amazing ! i am not a reader , and i could n't put it down i recommend this play for any actor it will stretch your mind and acting abilities

a great reference book to have for any designer , although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject i would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things typographical
just when you thought you 've heard all larry has to offer it gets way better i 've only just started reading it the past 2 days , but i have to say it i don't care who you are that's funy right there ! ! ! ! !
this book was referred to me by one of the author 's students i have been practicing karuna reiki for several years i was thrilled to read this book the author has introduced many specific healing techniques and symbol combinations that have produced amazing results for my clients she obviously has an incredible passion for karuna reiki because the book reads as if the energy itself wrote every word

what fun ! this hilarious book is filled with
this is n't really a novel and it is n't really a collection of short stories , but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time , as he imagines einstein envisioned them each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time time is money , time flows uphill , live in the present forget the past , time is motion , etc
it 's been a while since i 've read one of janet evanovich 's stephanie plum novels , but a sudden need for light reading found ten big ones at the book store plum 's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after joe morelli or ranger , how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station , and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed definitely light fare , even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic he not only wants stephanie dead , but he also wants her end to be spectacular
i 've long been a fan of borges the short fiction writer but this little book has made me an instant fan of borges the reader and borges the literary critic i have to admit that so much of petry mystifies me , but within the pages of this book , i felt as if borges' insight was finally allowing me to understand poetry in a way i had n't considered before witty , modest and polymathic , borges shines through the pages of this book you can read it in an hour , but if you read it for 1 week straight , you still would n't be able to appreciate all the gems of wisdom in it great stuff
i enjoyed this book it focuses mainly on franklin 's time abroad in england and france and gives an overview on who franklin was and how he interacted on the world stage during the revolutionary period i believe it 's very accessible and would be a good starting place for anyone interested in franklin 's life he 's funny
all right all right , i say so i'm writing about a preteen book about a little girl that does n't make me weird does it \? it should n't since i had to read it for a college course so i'm writing because , well , who would 've ever guessed , but i loved it \? it 's a ripping story , man it is funny , inventive , historic and riveting , all the things i was sure it would n't be when i got assigned the book so , here i am , blown away by a book about a little girl i do n't even like history , but it was n't presented as antiquated it was dealt with as you and i would deal with our history , as pertinent , in the moment , and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book i'm telling you , the character darby is great , as are all the characters , including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon , etc , until darby unintentionally questions everything , causing all matter of problems , like maybe she 'll get knocked off by the klan the story is actually something you 'll find yourself absolutely focused on i could n't put it down i 've read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class , and i can say that if i had a kid , i 'd be pouring this down their brain so , does that make me weird \? who cares , huh \? i had to read the book for my class , and i'm happy i did
i decided to read this book because i enjoyed dr o'connor 's book , undoing depression so much i am delighted to report that undoing perpetual stress is an even better book
when i saw the cover of this book , i had a feeling i would love it the picture of the little boy on the cover flexing his muscles is something i have seen my three sons do many , many times when i opened it and started to read , wonderful memories flooded back of when my sons were younger i laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories
few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece this is one of them
i too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as i wanted this is a perfect metaphor for the book when all you 've ever wanted is n't enough the book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside , that always seems to want something more until they arrive at that something more , people can never truly feel content
this is da book on the dick van dyke show , but it 's really far more than that it is the finest book on a tv sitcom i 've ever come across waldron painstakingly discusses everything you 'd ever want to know about the show , and he interviewed \( seemingly \) everyone connected with the show , including carl reiner , mary tyler moore , dick , larry matthews , rose marie , and many of the writers if you 're a dvds fan , you 've gottta have this tome on hand i ca n't recommend it highly enough i fervently hope vince will do subsequent books on cheers and other sitcoms he 's the only man for the job
i purchased this book after having seen super size me and i was a little worried that there would be nothing new for morgan to present i , however , was proven wrong this is a very good read that is able to put down more statistics and specifics about the food industry that the movie was not as focuses on the movie , of course , was focused mostly on the fast food industry
the nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the outsider 's incorrect perceptions or the insider 's preconceptions , depending on which is constructing the definition what we find with w j cash 's the mind of the south is no different , although it is a pleasant journey sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing , cash 's work deserves recognition for this reason alone yet there is value in the exposition itself , even if it forgets a full two thirds of the south 's population in its description \( blacks and women \) what the modern reader is left with , then , is not so much a description of the the southern mind as it is the white southern male mind and while cash 's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind , it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the american south , with a small dash of glory added for good measure
this is another collection of barry 's columns and a surefire hit for any fan as usual , his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke mr language person makes an appearance or two in this collection , and barry also takes on tv commericials , his relationship with his wife , and \( always a winner \) the life of his teenaged son recommended
while i agree with several people who do n't consider this chick lit , i do n't see why that is a bad thing i enjoyed radish 's writing style , purple prose and all if you 're expecting a dickensian journey into a complex character , this book is not it however , it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life
kudos to finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter the fact that he himself , a descendent of holocaust survivors , has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points you cannot criticize the state of israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti semite any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless un resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism by far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the swiss banks this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work hilberg 's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight , and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi volume set the destruction of european jews would be well served to check it out
not only was the book cheaper on amazon than the bookstores but i ordered this book for my boyfriend from here and i got it earlier than expected so that was great ! he says it has great step by step images and that 's a positive for him since he learns more from visuals also , it has instructions that he 's able to follow and understand
we have enjoyed another of eric carle 's books brown bear brown bear what do you see since my son was a few weeks old so , when my son was about 7 months old , i bought from head to toe it was a wonderful purchase ! after a few reads , my son was imitating the animals just like his mama waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat it was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books i read to him

if you are a runner , you may have experienced the mental benefits that running provides you may have also felt a spiritual presence while running , perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail in this extraordinary book , joslin explores this mind body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport he shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal the book is well thought out and written with a great deal of humility and care this is one that i will read again and again it changed the way i approach running i also think about this book throughout the day , even when i am not running a great book
i am a total addict of leslie sansone 's walk away programs i had many exercise videos , but never stuck to anything until i found her energizing , fun , and most of all easy workouts
to think about racism is to be thoughtful to be thoughtful is to be engaged in the process of learning to refuse to reflect on and examine your belief systems is to be ignorant
this book was originally published ca 1980 as england and always i have not seen the original so i ca n't tell how much of this book is new material \( beyond a chapter dealing with peter jackson 's films \) lobdell has examined tolkien 's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives one of the most interesting deals with the influence of edwardian adventure fiction \( haggard , etc \) on tolkien another fascinating chapter deals with middle earth as a christian world in a pre christian age there is also a short fiction story in an appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to tolkien 's own abandoned sequel to the lord of the rings , the return of the shadow i enjoyed this story , though of course lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to tolkien \( but then , no one can ! \)
the watercolors are beautiful , but more amazing than that is the way the stories are told zen shorts has really caught my kids even my youngest , \( 7 years \) who is drawn to all things panda , is requesting the stories again and again because they make her wonder there are some wonderful kid 's books out there , but this is something special
this is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened it does not deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse \( the author explicitly states this on many occasions \) and the reviewer who suggested that this is a terrific book if you are child molester probably \( i guess \) did n't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy
masterfully thought out written not your usual supernatural , horror king story written in 4 5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural , but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood , follows them through the years culminates with them as adults each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in at the end they are all tied together in some ways years later it 's ingenious in it 's finale and i advise you set aside some time for reading it 's very difficult to put down once it grabs your interest , it just sucks you into the story if you remember your childhood friends \( we all do \) you 'll identify with the story
phyllis chesler is a most unusual feminist she really does n't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority , gender feminist crowd the one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth this seems to be her most pervasive \( and endearing \) feature as an intellectual , and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent death of feminism release here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text on the whole , it makes for compelling reading we find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else they have many of the same , yet subtlety different , characteristics as do men in these pages , chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner many mother daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations why feminists would n't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me we should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy chesler never implies any inter sex superiority or inferiority , she is content to describe what is , and it 's great stuff indeed
i have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec

raskolnikov , an impovershed student in 19th century st petersburg , conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker he justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse the world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes after all , the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society the crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with raskolnikov 's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering almost every major character in the book is more likeable that raskolnikov
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
i had to read this book as an assignment for a seminary class on leadership i was sceptical that a children 's book about witches would be applicable to a master 's level college course my scepticism was unfounded this is a good , fun read but , more than that , this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it 's characters i recommend it to children of all ages !
in faith in nation , anthony marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the literary trope \( p 15 \) about a liberal , inclusive western nationalism instead , he argues that even the truest brand of western nationalism that of england and france came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale his entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today this leads one to question why does he insist on such a position \? has he made the case for it \? what happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong \?
tony judt 's postwar a history of europe since 1945 is the well researched material from a british conservative born 1948 in london and educated at cambridge and paris on political , social and economic developments in europe following world war ii
as a pharmacy student , i found the washington manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options , as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories this is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment this book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state , but rather focuses on the causes , measurements and treatments my only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics , is considered old
this book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most u s citizens for so many years each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details , names and places of the participants this book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand why they hate us i only regret that their is not a sequel

i took the 2 tom cover 's classes in information theory at stanford last year we used this book as the text for both classes the first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones this book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory

in her latest book , tracey wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read

this book is a perfect trade off between simplified for dummies type writing that simply acquaints you with the subject matter and a comprehensive text that thoroughly covers the subject if you are a cpa hopeful , a governmental finance professional or a political science graduate student this is the text for you although layout and vocabulary could be simplified for improved readability , once you become familiar with the authors' style the reading is enjoyable
there was not a single poem i did n't like , and most of them i loved her poems seem to touch upon the core of things i feel comfortable with saying i think she is in the same league as mary oliver , hafiz , stafford , and rumi
in the last few decades historians following sociologists such as durkheim have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people 's experience of space and time schivelbusch 's small piece is a pretty good \( but light weight \) example of this genre he reveals some interesting trivia along the way he tells , for example , how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of first class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed he shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting social values of europe and america but he is at his most interesting when describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations furthermore , by creating the need for standardized time tables , railways nurtured a standardized homogenized conception of time local idiocyncracies became less important doubtless true national identities could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and communications a book that takes these ideas much further is stephen kern 's excellent work the culture of time and space if this genre interests you , kern 's book is an important read
this is my favorite of the series thus far without wanting to give too much away , this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why roland is willing to give up anything and everything \( and clearly has \) just to get to the dark tower king mentions that the dark tower series is sort of like his middle earth , where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world , and you see what he means with this book fan 's of the stand will recognize signs of the super flu within the first few hundred pages , and one of my all time favorite king villains comes back to pay his respects
i really like this book it was well written and enjoyable the characters in it were very interesting to read about i like the way that imogene and maxine stayed friends all the way through the book the two girls really seemed to bring out the best in each other maxine never thought imogene was crazy because of the strange things that happened maxine just believed her and helped her through everything overall it was a well written book with very good characters and it showed what friendship really is

immanuel kant is truly one of the most influential moral philosophers in history and with this book , groundwork of the metaphysics of morals , he positioned himself far further
said gives good insight into politics , especially in the middle east i did n't enjoy the literature section as much because i was n't familiar with the authors
hal zina bennett 's profound advice from his prolific writing career \( over 30 published books \) is , write from the heart as wonderful as that sounds , most writers know it 's not an easy thing to do hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader i can speak from my own personal experience , having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book , sacred woman , sacred dance awakening spirituality through movement and ritual write from the heart also offers practical guidance in several areas this includes such things as the need for solitude however , he is not just talking about having a quiet space , he goes beyond the physical to the inner a state of mind he says , once we know what it is , what it looks like and feels like , we can create it for ourselves , almost i say almost regardless of where we happen to be i would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
in light of rev falwell 's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of sept 11 , 2001 , i recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand , why would that guy say that stuff \? harding presents an objective , intelligent , perceptive analysis of the way that fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world , and how jerry falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active moral majority of the 1980s harding combs through falwell 's history and sermons to observe how the language of being born again affects the listener , showing falwell 's shift from separatism to political activism she critiques both falwell and falwell 's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way good reading and good understanding
i agree with the reviews already written i too got bogged down with trying to keep track of the names it is when i got to the end i found the listing of the people if i had known that earlier it would have reduced my mind confusion really enjoyed the way the book was written you felt their pain with out seeing their blood i better understand the explosion
kurt vonnegut 's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself his unique style of black humor , combined with his vivid imagination is second to none this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read ! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality is he , or is he not crazy \?
first off this is a history of hollywood not the history of hollywood david thomson is n't writing the chronological , straight up , blow by blow account of hollywood movies the whole equation is an essay that takes as its question , are hollywood films ever art like a beethoven symphony or a picasso painting \? he says they are both more and less than that more because american film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen that serendipity is wonderful when it works which is n't often less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits
i read any way the wind blows not a day goes by before i read abide with me if you happen to come into the series of e lynn 's books and want more of the scoop on basil 's problems with his past , raymond 's lifestyle , the true 'not so divafied' evil side of yancey and they 're mutual friends then you should start with this one ! it 'll help you put 'two two together' on the lives and backgrounds of all of the characters
underground education does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective , as is perhaps implied by the title but rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past some of the historical figures are famous , such as george washington and cleopatra while others , like the several female serial killers discussed , are more obscure the book is divided into 10 chapters , including the arts , religion , science and sex actually , this book reminds me somewhat of the people 's almanac series written by david wallechinsky but here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse it 's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge but some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover still it is a worthwhile purchase
national geographic magazine has long been recognized for the quality of its color photographs by its brilliant staff of photographers who manage to go to places both known and unknown and open vistas of other cultures , other peoples , other landscapes in this very large and exceptionally affordable volume are some of ng 's finest images plus many dazzling photographs not previously published in the magazine the result is a panorama of the world as few other books can supply
colonial fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology , critiques of orientalism that isolate gender and culture , and the western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm one of yegenoglu 's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process as desire frames the relation between the subject and its other , yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation as a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen , the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest , but simultaneously displaced her argumentation is lucid and compelling for the colonial gaze , the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire \( in the fantasy of unveiling \) as well as the bte noire , because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project the veil therefore frustrates the identity forming process of the subject object positioning in colonialist discourse the subject cannot quite see the object , and its subjectivity thus remains in question interestingly , this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by western feminism as the veil has come to signify the backwardness of islam and its inherent oppression of women , the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference in this dynamic , the identity of the liberated western woman is constructed vis vis the oppressed muslim woman \( 102 \) since the status of western women is contingent on the continued representation of muslim women as oppressed , yegenoglu reveals that the western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded enlightenment ideology she argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments \( 115 \) this facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles in sum , yegenoglu 's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post colonial theorists
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row , at least in the state of mississippi , and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however , some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain

fabulously entertaining novel from martin amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `information ' john self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials he is an alcoholic , a misogynist , and a microcosm of mainstream american culture in the 1980 's john has also landed a gig directing a feature film , titled `good money , ' and `bad money , ' depending on what day of the week it is amis' writing is mordantly brilliant both acerbic and biting there are transactions in here that i just love , such as john 's stinging interactions with his girlfriend selina

i think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously as political thrillers go , this is one of the best of the genre it 's packed with insider information , from power mad politicians and the amoral king makers who advise them , to nerves of steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the fbi granted the premise is implausible a group of former seals assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the seals believe have sold the country down the river \( or , in the southern vernacular , because they needed killin' \) while one can argue whether the seals have the high moral ground in this setting , it does n't detract from the page turning non stop action like a thrill ride at disneyland , this book should not be examined too critically just get in , hold on , close your eyes , and enjoy the ride
i ca n't say enough about this wonderful book it 's packed full of examples , covers more than just the pre adoption and placement aspects , and is incredibly non judgemental there 's so much information here , more than i expected it really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption it 's for both birth and adoptive parents , in fact , two of the birth parents we 've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption i'm so glad it was recommended to us if you 're thinking about adoption , even if you 're thinking that open adoption is n't right for you i highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book it 's great

william manchester , the greatest narrative historian of or time , provides a vivid account of his experiences in the pacific theatre during world war ii as with all of his books , we see , hear , smell , taste , and feel the experiences with him , as if we were there although more personal , of course , than his other narrative histories , goodbye darkness provides the same factual details , and each sentence , paragraph , and chapter is crafted with the same beauty and skill that is manchester 's hallmark an amazing memoir by a truly great writer

the waste lands , the third novel in stephen king 's the dark tower series is by far the best volume yet this volume picks up a short time after the end of drawing of the three , and we see roland training eddie and susannah to become true gunslingers in roland 's world soon into the novel , the three gunslingers encounter one the guardians of mid world , a huge cyborg bear , who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the dark tower by a beam , and if they follow the beam , it will lead them directly to the dark tower , they just do n't know how far away it is

the advice seems to be good advice to use in any relationship you also have to know your own situation very well and know when not to use his advice my ex would feel crowded if i sent her a bunch of sweet cards like the book says to do and would feel like i was trying to manipulate her , therefore i took it easy on the cards my ex may never get back with me because we are long distance but i feel i am loving her much better than before because of this book even if she does n't realize it remember to never tell your lover that you read this book , especially if he she is nervous about being manipulated
i'm glad i bought this book and i will continue to refer to it the remit of the dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss the text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science in this respect it would have been a difficult book to author , readers having come from one discipline or the other i agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree bioinformatics is a new field , and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler
i wo n't spoil the ending , but some many other reviewers did n't like the twist however , the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100 happy should read runaway jury however , like the firm \( another great book \) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble , this book has a very realistic ending that you did n't expect this was my favorite grisham book , followed by the firm , runaway jury , and pelican brief i found the broker to be too much of an italian lesson , the brethern simplistic , and the street lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people with very little story holding it together if you like the firm you will like the partner
here is the disclaimer i was already a proponent of tort reform before i read this book however , after reading this novel , i am a stronger proponent of it than ever enter clay carter unknown defender in d c of the poorest of the poor then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap , one he ca n't refuse , partly because the parent 's of his long time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money
this book is rather different although it 's about copernicus' book de revolutionibus , very little astronomy is discussed there is also very little about copernicus himself the main theme of the book is finding as many still existing copies of copernicus' book as possible , and describing each one in detail the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so called census of that ancient book , i e , a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world since i know nothing about antique book collecting , i learned a lot on this field by reading this book i was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book , especially identifying the authors of any hand written notes on its pages i did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous , but some of the author 's adventures are quite intriguing , particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book , as well as discussions of some of copernicus' contemporaries , are touched upon but as the author states , this book is really a memoir of his census project i think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting
like pretty much anything in which neil 's involved , this a fine and useful work the reviews of teddy millon 's axis ii taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves but after 30 years in the field , i 'll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you 're treating

i consider myself an optimist and insightful person , but somehow managed to miss many of postrel 's insights she gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than i previously thought she does keep that hope in check , though , by talking about the enemies of the future primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat , instead of the blessing that it is
after seeing the movie , i decided to pick up the book this book proved to be very funny , as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many , many women her age face today fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true , often serious real life topics \( being single and not liking it , infidelity , betrayal \) and is yet able turn it into light , funny reading that takes talent , in my book in the wrong hands , this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read \( in light of the above topics \) you cant help but root for bridget

mccain et al write very well and i was impressed by his style the writing was not the only style with which i became familiar but the style of the man himself , john mccain this was a truthful , revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less than honorable profession we can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father i believe this read is one to add to one 's readings of autobiographies biographies

this is what happens when uneducated reactionaries dictate to a concept that is beyond their comprehension it 's just more sanke oil from the same pigs who gave us the scams of deregulation \( capitalism governing itself \) , privatization \( the giveaway of what our taxes bought to those who pay little or no tax \) , and globalization \( repositioning the republican party to a time predating the emancipation proclamation \) hitler and mussolini would certainly approve
i first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990 's it aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion like many a cynic i asked myself , now who 's this guy and what 's he spinning \? against my natural inclination to dismiss it , i ordered pog on receiving it i began reading and found my suspicions confirmed here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of god

it is not often i reread a book but this was well worth it it is the true story of a cracker who set about trying to break into computer networks and how people from system administrators to the fbi try to stop him written in the style of a thriller , you are swept along in amazement at the exploits of the cracker if this does n't alter your view of internet security nothing will on the down side it becomes a chore trying to keep all the players straight in one 's head , it is indeed a cast of many although somewhat geeky at times and it does help to have some background in computer networking it wo n't prevent you from enjoying what is surely the most bizarre story of internet hacking you will read
as an econ student at uc davis , i have learned to appreciate books that explain concepts concisely and in an easily understandable way this is one of those few chapters are relatively short and are uncluttered with unnecessary examples or tangents graphs are labeled with simple explanations that are useful for clarification as well as quick reference

this is the sort of book i have been looking for a long time i 've read other books on the middle east which purport to have a similar focus , but which are instead incomplete , notably sowing the wind this book , by contrast , maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region it looks as if the book was written as a textbook for \( i would presume \) grad students studying the subject , but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal

the boom mr dent speaks of has begun but is starting in the population centers of the far east and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in america the boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers since so many of our publicly traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations , they are using that cost savings in order to finance the implementation of sarbanes oxley the net effect is that sarbanes oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of u s publicly traded companies this is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws so the industries that will expand will primarily focus around

you probably know joel siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on good morning america but do you know the rest of the story \? here 's a chance to find out
how does she do it \?
wilson does n't spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees he tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life you get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire it 's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds when he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite , you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow
my hat 's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review it is beyond anything i 've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines unlike the embedded journalists of our own time , the writers and photographers who covered vietnam were much closer to being free agents , restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of america 's military presence in southeast asia \( there it is \) , while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself
in 2003 i suffered my worst major depression ever it lasted for over a year , and in the worst moments which lasted months my anguish was so intense that i wished i were dead again , the worst part was when i could n't even get a full night 's rest , and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a m full of despair , unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief , and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching having to get up in the morning was hell needless to say i could n't work , and that increased my ill feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four \( we have two adolescent kids \)
when considering the faith of the founders of the u s , it is easy to rely on half truths and assumptions david holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well researched book which uses historical documentation , personal letters , and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused he begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th century which influenced our founders one interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government sponsored churches , a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation although many of the people he describes , including george washington , benjamin franklin , and thomas jefferson , were brought up in orthodox christian churches , such as episcopal and congregational , they were later influenced by the deist movement which opposed many orthodox christian views he describes some interesting practices , such as the fact that george washington would leave anglican services before participating in communion , despite the fact that his wife martha would stay for the sacrament this is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the deist leanings of her husband holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers' did in writing this book holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian , and which makes it all the more believable
this volume contains entries that deal with concepts , events , persons , and movements in u s history the length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered in addition , the entires both inform the reader with up to date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline the entries are clearly written and eminently readable they are persuasive in thier opionions , yet respectful of other stances the cross references are helpful and ample the same obtains for the bibliographies the oxford companion to u s history far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in u s history its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances the entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial i would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research

as a follower of christ \( christian \) who considers himself an evangelical protestant , this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart for all christian believers , the richness and power of brother lawrence 's life 's witness and words are a fountain of truth , a treasure that is as elegant \( spiritually \) as it is simple for the non believers , i am afraid that reading this booklet \( a spiritual treasure in disguise \) will just confirm st paul the apostles 's words that the message of the cross is foolishness to the gentiles \( 1 corinthians 1 18 , 23 and 2 14 \)
i love this cookbook use it all the time ! my daughter has many allergies \( tree nuts included \) so we have n't been able to use all the recipes , but those that we have are wonderful ! i keep checking back , hoping to see another book by this author , but have n't found any so far as for the rantings spoken about in another review i read the book cover to cover and did n't find anything that fits that description i enjoyed ms meyer 's stories of her children and her 'journey' and appreciate her having shared it thanks

i disagree with the reviewer who said that this book does not offer solutions again and again the author reports that people need to be heard , and need to stop repressing emotions to get well as a counselor working with battered women , i was amazed at the number of them who also had auto immune disorders such as fibromyalgia this book is a must read
i will probably write a few apa format papers while getting a master 's degree on line and i think for my limited use , apa the easy way is the right product for me i agree with other reviewers that if you do a lot of writing in the apa style , you may need the complete manual however , i have the complete manual and since i bought apa the easy way , i do n't think i will ever need to use the full size manual again i especially like that it gives step by step instructions on how to do all of the set ups for ms word
this item is a must have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints \( lds or mormons for short \) while not an authentic artifact , it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of america 's most successful and controversial social religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries

having read all of mccarthy 's other books already , i came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content and i was not disappointed mccarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters the vivid description of the mountains , the people , and their culture puts the reader right there in the story these harsh , terse , and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long , long time i found this story a little more abstract than most of mccarthy 's other works , yet i was able to see his message in the end required reading for any mccarthy fan
i bought this book along with saving dinner and saving dinner for the holidays last year
so here is a collection of essays by jonathan franzen , the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001 , the corrections many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as harper 's and the new yorker so , readers should know what they 're getting into i read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of franzen as a corporeal human being , and not just some exalted author of an award winning novel overall , i liked most of the essays appearing in this collection from the promising opener , in which franzen poignantly recounts his father 's slow descension into quietus from alzheimer 's , we progress to a quasi portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in america , before ashcroft and the patriot act invaded the american lexicon why bother \( which was previously referred to as the harper 's essay \) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st century as a tool of social reform the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform , but , should rather be written ultimately for plain old entertainment value , franzen seems to argue
i would first like to start by saying that the picture of dorian gray is , by far , one on my favorite novels and were i not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel i would have given it 5 stars , without a doubt
i used this book for an introductory lesson on descriptive cataloguing in library , archival and information science it worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach a lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way there are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding
ironically , socialist , anti american , iconoclastic professor taylor , could be , at least in this work , the inspiration for the great david irving 's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war it is demonstrated that adolph hitler , the popular nationalist german leader , was no more responsible , and in many ways less so , than the so called allies , who foolishly guaranteed poland , only to give her over to jewish bolshevism at yalta by refusing to grant germany 's rightful place as a continental power , britain and france lost millions of lives , their world empires , and their economic prominence the sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the soviets and their western fellow travellers and upon the final dissolution of the evil empire , courtesy of one dutch reagan , we have a european continent completely dominated by germany
in a sea of books from self proclaimed career counselors , mr corcodilos has no nonsense advice from a true insider instead of the usual yada yada , corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo
i loved this story it was enriched with so many lessons , emotions , and detail that you felt like you were right there with lous and oz i would recommend this story to any one ! !
i really enjoyed this book it took me a while to read it , about 2 months , because it 's definitely not fast paced i was glad i had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand
i liked track of the cat , but i did n't love it the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing , but the plot was , at times , predictable the setting was well drawn , but most of the characters were pretty one dimensional the clincher , though , is that i'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character i believe that this is her first story , so i do n't want to make a snap judgement , but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple that would be expecting a lot , i know , but frankly she is n't even as engaging as , say , gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael , and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch
exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago i also attended the guerilla business school , a 2500 intensive
this is one of my favorite books of all time , and during my 40 years of life i 've read a lot of them
as one reads peter pan , one does n't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim i had ridiculously high expectations of mr barrie 's imagination before purchasing this title , and he has fulfilled them completely
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
having patronized boulevard all but twice , i still feel the need to write a review you have to understand that those of us back east think that california food is understated and so easy now not being a huge chef myself , but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes \( my fave restaurants being of course , boulevard , and back east , 2941 , le tire bouchon , maestro , citronelle dc , galileo , inn at little washington , etc \) i have no clue where i 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook , other than maybe the san francisco ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market \( another real sf treat ! \) but to be real , we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised now i was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and i have her handwriting just ingredients , no measurements and yes , i 've been able to improvise , and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of recipes but nothing is better than going to the restaurant cookbooks are fab and fun , but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals \( herselves \) are even more exciting buy this book even just for the photographs , as i 've never been in a more well decorated and well thought out restaurant if only i did n't live on the east coast !

do n't get me wrong , this was an enjoyable read since retiring matthew hope i guess em had an urge to return to sw florida with this tale funny adult repartee and a good mystery but only age 9 12 reading level according to the amazon rating \? \? these latest books from mcbain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a tv episode rate , but how about trying to stretch a bit
i have spent a lot of time and money researching into mormon history the big problem is that , as henry ford once said history is bunk with joseph smith and the history of the mormon church , there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many , an ingenious charlatan there are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide hence , using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of joseph smith can be a very frustrating \( and sometimes expensive \) exercise the church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony , but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony it is easy to see from my statement above , why
i call this one frank peretti lite it was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare , this one had a creationist angle i really enjoyed it , just not the same as his other books also , you have to remember that this is fiction of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible but the central point about mutations comes through great summer read
i have n't had a chance to read the book in its entirity , but have enjoyed what i have read
this book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript the images are combined with the text to convey meaning in the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context
one reviewer of this book said he 's sick of investing tomes , they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors , who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients
this book was horrible if it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books , especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items , which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug , self serving and self indulgent , written by a person with little or no empathy , especially for the people he castigates for example , his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders
i'm not sure who 's writing these reviews , but i read repitition after repitition after repitition , with a lot of confusing fluff asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues what 's fierce about that \?
i picked up the first book in this series \( the eyre affair \) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed still , the potential for the series seemed so large that i went ahead and read this second one too , only to be even less enchanted with the franchise this is a pure sequel , and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of thursday next is strict order , lest one miss out of allusions to past events although on further consideration , maybe it does n't matter , since clearly anything can and will happen in this series , and fforde is n't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway
not only do i disagree with his opinions , but some of his facts are blatently false on page 106 he refers to violence agains native americans by european settlers as isolated instances and not planned nor calculated had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable
i have received your new book against the human race , and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs , in reading your book , to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years , i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada , because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves voltaire \( 1755
this book was on somebody 's amazon com listmania for sea turtles , so i hunted it down it is only vaguely about sea turtles , in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book , and then he disappears , so it 's obvious that he was involved in the crime
i am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book honestly , it was a complete waste of my time to quote a friend , it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar if you are a fan of pedestrian writing , lack luster plots and hackneyed character development , this is your book
when professor polk describes the sweep of history in iraq , he is at his best , but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts much of the political ranting is supposition , marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work the ranting gets especially tedious towards the end my advice , read the first part and skip the last half
this is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution china the 5 people live relatively miserable lives , touched by official corruption and incompetence \( with the exception of one who benefits handsomely \) china is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality , with widespread corruption , and widespread incompetence this view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years this book is an interesting read as gossip often can be , but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day china
this is the sixth book in the left behind series it is also the first one in the series i did not finish in one sitting it did not flow as well as the others , so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening the book also spends a lot of time re telling what we read in previous books i felt this time like i read half a novel
this book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger , imperial powers said condemns intellectuals in the west who in his eyes are agents of exploitation yet said himself is an agent of racism
oh , yes this is a very fine book for me to poop on !
hands down this is bukowski 's single worst book bought it when it first came out just before after his death in 1994 having read just about everything the man had written , pulp was a hugely disappointing epitaph if you 've never read bukowski start with post office or the short story collections , but avoid this like the plague a bad book i ca n't think of a single reason to recommend it
very average book ! frei does n't go down as one of my favorite sports writers loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story
this book had a good message , and could have had a lasting impact on me but the plot was obscenely dull , and the middle of the book \( gene and finny relationship \) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book not recommended
finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty ! yunnus has proven , by the success of his bank 's loans to the desperately poor , that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support founder of the grameen bank , he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world \( including the us and canada \) have shown that lending to the poor , helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye opener it made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help it 's hard to separate the book from the idea one is as fascinating as the other out of 5 points , i give it a six
while reading this book i found the details of some cases to be unbelievable also , the photographs of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings i 've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim 's hair or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore and who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent doberman pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence \? sure , just let that dog on in and whose place of employment has a record of all employee 's blood groups \( not their types , just their groups \) , when the employee does n't even know himself what group he is \?
i was disappointed in this book especially after reading the other stellar reviews \( which are all , weirdly , from texas , where the author lives \)
he gave it all he had , but there just was n't much of interest there he 's a self described , turmoiled loser , and not very interesting one to boot kafka , roth , and jeremy leven \( satan , et al \) , write about similar troubled jews , and are much funnier and interesting i like his honesty , but , it 's not worth the price of admission
the paleo diet is based on an interesting premise the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment it seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time , because their decisions are instinctual self awareness creates a problem that does n't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans sometimes we do things out of curiosity , or laziness , or false beliefs so , considering the erratic behavior of present day humans , who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs \? even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error , frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild
if you want a biased and misleading account of the arab war against israel , this ought to satisfy you
did n't care for this book at all if you want to learn about stephen king you 'd be much better off reading or listening to his book on writing
i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure , but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold , but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little
i want to make a short comment here
what a bunch of high school hallway gossip ! the author does not know the difference between white and albino ! the 'genetics' discussions on color \( which includes people , chickens , horses , and dogs all of it suspect \) and mutts vs purebred dogs are total claptrap ! i confess , i could n't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies ' what \? \? a waste of my hard earned having read those parts i cannot believe anything that went before or that follows , not that i'm reading any further how is a multi published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print \? and now she 's influenced readers a terrible situation publisher , where are your pre publication reviews \? shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published !
this book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if james frey did not repeat himself a million times
not all that useful , really message is buy mutual funds ! in general , since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market , just buy index funds would be the best advice most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the ceo to go over the financials and confirm your valuation oh , thanks peter , what great advice \( mr gates , your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares \)
the biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming i thought i was buying a book about knitting , but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions
just finished reading this novel this morning and i think it is probably the weakest one of the lot like a lot of reviewers , i did n't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the stephanie plum series as well , the supposed sexual tension love triangle between stephanie , joe and ranger is approaching its use by date it is definitely becoming boring and i think ms evanovich needs to resolve stephanie 's romantic situation once and for all i still enjoy characters like lula and grandma mazur but a lot of the situations stephanie found herself in fell flat with me there are only so many times she can have her car blown up , handbag destroyed , apartment broken into , etc , before it becomes tiresome and repetitive i still think there is a spark of life in the stephanie plum series , but i hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by the numbers as this one
there are plenty of excellent play therapy books out there , this is not one of them maybe it 's just me , but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly i need quick access , color and art
when you have lost weight , it 's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off whenever they have heard me tell my story , read my blog or book , or found out that i did it on the low carb lifestyle , one question invariably has come up from time to time
this book is just plain stupid if it works for people and helps them lose weight i realize they will be estatic however , it is not healthy each of our meals should be balanced these people are promoting unbalanced eating the reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs ! if one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups , including complex carbs in small amounts , we would not only lose weight in a safe manner , but we would heal our bodies from the inside out this diet wo n't heal us , it is a fad if anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism , lose weight and even heal disease , try reading the schwarzbein principle by diana schwarzbein , md that is a great book on how to heal diabetes , hypoglycemia , and many other things it also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight , but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place this book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss , not getting healthy
no wonder john gardner did n't write more fiction books he was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction , rather than actually writing it creative atrophy i believe john gardner himself would call it if there 's ever been a better example of the those who ca n't do , teach argument , i have n't encountered it this is hardly the place a young writer should start instead , how about reading what you like and avoiding ignoramouses such as john gardner \? john gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world 's finest writers never made it through college , and many more did n't have the luxury of a rigorous classical education the most hilarious part is where gardner mentions that only through a line by line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy shakespeare it 's interesting to note how gardner , who taught creative writing at the university level , fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
this was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author 's task management system this was the beginning of the scientific management line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book the essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time he also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success still , a reader should n't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources the book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers
i know a lot of people liked this book , but it did n't work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off , acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is , they did n't there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot , and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin , early on , but no one does , not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation
if tony hillerman wrote this novel \( novella actually \) , i sure ca n't tell i have been a chee leaphorn fan for many years , but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman 's other work it is reminiscent of a 'b' movie instead of building suspense , the plot is laid out all too plainly , the characters are unreal , and the chee bernie romance does n't ring true i am amazed that it was published
i gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas the best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book i have read carolyn , bill , and amy 's books and i want to give this one a try
really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract and disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields , so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book , because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic , oppressed other type of woman , thanks
this was one of five books that i brought from amazon com and by far the worst of the lot this man has one idea about how the government really works take it from me i have been with the irs for five years
i bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane not one of my better decisions very wordy , and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it 's totally absurd reminds me of the way the cops talked in dragnet we are talking zero development of characters perhaps mr woods feels he does n't need to give any depth to characters that he 's been writing about in previous books well , he 's wrong you basically just do n't care about these people they are n't real , and they talk weird not much action either , unless you count actions like they got in the car they got in the boat they got in the plane you get the picture this is another case of a well known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money do n't fall into his trap like i did there are a lot better books out there
should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision \? i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle designed to make the question of martha mdiddy 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side \? by normalizing , generalizing , and minimalizing martha mdiddy 's crimes , are we loosing our morality \? how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company \?
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death
i found this book very boring tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
i am by no means an economist , and much less an expert on finance , but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled , unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis i 've seen much subtler discussions of the efficient market hypothesis written for general audiences , enough of them so i can recognize that lowenstein does n't get it he equates efficient markets with the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value , and not with you ca n't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do this is a crucial difference , because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water
inspired by his uncle , eddie , who worked at an amusement park , albom writes a well coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife , which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience the concept is old a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths there are concepts to be learned from the five people the story is delightful and cavalier
this is a moderately well spun book about the no spin zone should be called the know spin zone since really nothing in it is objective o'reilly is a case study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this in other words it 's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it if you ca n't see through o'reilly 's bias then this book is poison
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then , the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan , i would not recommend this book
hey here 's an idea what if hitler was right all along , only it is men , not jews , who are to blame for all the woes of the world we should build a new auschwitz and exterminate them all right andrea \? in my opinion , this is just as bad as any misogynist it 's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women 's liberation movement back for so long
the glorious cause is the sequel to rise to rebellion , and since the first novel was so good i eagerly dove into this one , but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization on a scale of 1 to 10 , i give it a 4 , as compared to the 8 i would give rise to rebellion
do yourself a favor do n't waste your time with this book
if you 're thinking of reading this book , let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy \( really \) , and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners , but this book , in perfectly plain english , sucked there is no plot , no beginning , middle or end , and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help , but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
not as good as entre nous less fun and more acedemic but even then it is not a well written essay the few good salient points are repeated too often , and with not much creativity or development
the other boleyn girl and the queen 's fool are two of the best books i 've ever read and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin 's lover fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced , constructed i'm going back to trollope
i listened to this as an audiobook this is the worst book i 've ever listened to from audible the worst the narration is just too , too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best unfortunately , i keep hearing emperor franz josef in amadeus saying , it has , well , too many notes barr describes everything \( including clothes , hair , shoes , etc \) with multiple metaphors , a plethora of adjectives , and , well , too many notes i kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story
i am a nevada barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with high country the story takes place in a restaurant \( boring \) the characters were dull and i kept getting them confused anna 's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome i also missed anna 's sister , molly , who is only mentioned a few times in the book
this is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter the suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out the suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big \( duh \) and then group like items together \( duh \) that 's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system oh is that affordable \? if i had 75 , 000 to redo my kitchen i would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins come on , do n't waste your money on this book or it 's suggestions very few pictures and all for the rich i thought good housekeeping was for the everyday family get it at the library and then return it after you do n't read it
hmm , quite a disappointment , especially after splurging on the hardcover edition set as a kind of rockies rear window , this is one slow story endless pages of crazy making when i 'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through finally skipped ahead to finish the book i had really looked forward to angels fall , too \( if you are a roberts fan , do n't spend the money on the hardcover , wait for the paperback , go to the library , or borrow from a friend not worth the price

the back cover to this book was intriguing , and captured me immediately the writing , however , was so plodding , so inconsistent , and so non sequential that it was painful to get through to the end this is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day i ca n't believe that this book made it past the editors in one paragraph jon katz tells how rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet , and in the next he says that rose is too young to herd sheep in one paragraph he ca n't live without his wife , she gives his very existence meaning , and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to what was it again \? oh , right , herd sheep ! at one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he ca n't connect to and finally gives away and then ca n't stop visiting , even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog and why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys there 's a reason , jon !
from the remarks at this site , people either love this novel or hate it i hated it i hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about mfa program writing in the last 30 years the emphasis is entirely on style forget story forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere some of this thinking goes back to henry james , some of it goes back to virginia woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits \( like h g wells' the time machine \) the first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom frank bascombe is trying to sell a property it 's brilliantly written in fact , it 's so brilliantly written that i had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life , his loves , and the region of the country he inhabits this book has no driving plot in fact , it 's an arbitrarily chosen conceit what happens on july 4th in the life of one guy it 's not james joyce 's ulysses nor is it trying to be , but every thought this man has is in this book and none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person any perso should pick up the book
this was the first hard case publication book that i have tried it wo n't be the last , but i was hardly impressed with king 's story
i'm an avid reader of history , as well as processing a degree in the subject so imagine my surprise when , after receiving this book from a friend of mine for christmas , i read the erroneous account of the children 's crusade of 1212 i had done research on this topic , so i was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years \? if he had , he would have realized that there were actually two crusades one consisting of mainly french people led by stephen of cloyes who , when told to turn back by king philip ii , did so that ended that crusade the other one , led by a shepherd from germany named nicholas , led a group across the alps into italy some left for home while others continued on to rome it 's interesting to note that in rome , many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these children were either too old or because they were pregnant perhaps until relatively recently , people believed in the children 's crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles \( like chronica albrici monachi trium fontium \) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred , rather than relying on more contemporary sources nor did they realize that the latin word pueri used in the chronicles can have several meanings \( such as unmarried men rather than children \)
the bottom line on brainless is that one has to be brainless to take time to read coulter 's writings , and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them
are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better of course if his models were worth more than the paper they 're written on mandelbrot would n't have to write books like this because he 'd be cleaning out everyone else 's wallets on the stock market in particular , if it 's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative but the fact is , mandelbrot does n't know anything that countless other traders do n't already know so instead mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on wall street
to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in left behind would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start
while this book contains a ton of data , do n't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade if you look up french toast , for example , it only gives information on name brand items much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products i suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping , or use it before eating out , it would be helpful but if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items , you are out of luck with this book
this book was selected by my book club i had never read anna quindlen before rise and shine was a disappointment to me i kept hoping that meghan would somehow be redeemed , but that did not happen she is really not very likeable i thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning leo 's tradgedy meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again the book left me with an empty feeling it was not a satisfying read
in addition to the fact that i , too , felt that i was enduring a commercial for dfa , i was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of the only guide to a winning investment strategy you 'll ever need index mutual funds and beyond the way smart money invests today , swedroe 's may , 1998 book he introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations , but if you 've read the first book , there 's no reason to look at this one
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
i received a book that i did n't even order the one i ordered is yellow and white \( 3th edition \) this is n't the one i ordered therefore , i need a refund i sent the book back and i know the seller received it on 8 19
it is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now coulter 's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like ms coulter piously hypocritically rail against she will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self selected audiences of something they already want to believe pitiful rants here if you are in it for fun or do n't care that you are getting a skewed , sensationalist opinion , maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store but for something better , why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed , analytical approach , rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst \( on both right and left \) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs \( more than the other 2 \) , and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , collapse a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now rk
when the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice he is a criminal and must be treated like one christian peper
hal abelson is responsible for a famous epigram , if i have n't seen as far as others , it is because giants were standing on my shoulders
author la guardia mentions how the lemba of africa have the jewish gene fine ! but when he deals \( in several pages mind you \) with the falashas \( also of africa \) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these jews not to be descended from the 12 tribes of israel despite the falashas 's longtime rep for possibly being a lost tribe of israel which , again , has now been 100 disproven through genetic studies
just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions
i first read passages from this book in college i can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds professor zinn is a far left author he uses the usual lines america generally bad , communism generally good obviously mr zinn has the right to write whatever he wants , and his writing style is very convincing however , if the reader investigates the facts , many holes become visible in his theories those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints a good example is intellectual morons how ideology makes smart people fall for stupid ideas by daniel j flynn which gives the reader a good profile of mr zinn
poorly proof read and obfuscatingly written , this book had the potential to clarify for the many the importance of black 's contributions it was a frustrating read due to lack of clarity and lack of simple explanations about the significance of black 's work
i agree with the reader \( s \) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown together , as if no one proofread it in one chapter she 'll recommend something then later on she 'll tell you it 's ineffective and or dangerous ! she gives a long , long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments , recommendations or opinions of her own personally i think most natural herbal supplements are a ripoff , but if she had given any testimonials by people who 've found them to work , i might consider trying them on the whole , this book is a waste of money
what a complete and utter waste of time its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots
i 've been a fan of heinlein 's sf for just about as long as i 've been an sf fan at all \( somewhere around thirty five years \) but when i read this collection some twenty odd years ago , it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether
i have to say i truly hated this book the premise sounded interesting so i decided to give it a try i 've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky this time i found her usual friends and co workers to be boring and self involved caricatures the groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way the constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows this is my last cromwell
there is n't anything in this book that you wo n't find in warren buffett 's annual letters to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway \( available for free at the berkshire hathaway website \) if you 've not read those letters then i suggest you get right to it they clearly lay out mr buffett 's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read , humorous and homely style
the last river the tragic race for shangri la tragic yes i 'd agree that this book is tragic
this books should be called the random thoughts of a rich old man it appears to me someone followed mr buffet around and wrote down what ever he said then thought how do i present this is a book \? , oh how about a random collection of dis jointed thoughts ! yea that 's it ! !
this book is great ! assuming you already have a ph d in political science otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting , or light reference the author shows bias towards the united states' form of democracy , as is to be expected in such a book the simplistic nature makes the reader annoyed more than informed the childish approach is suited for school children , but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis
in his book , the four agreements , don miguel ruiz , embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life he says that we should be impeccable with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our best the basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents he calls this process domestication \( p 6 \) ruiz says that 95 of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection the agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives
hart disputes o'reilly 's claim that the us gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else by countering that per capita the u s is near the bottom of the list o'reilly was n't quoted as saying more tax money per capita
after two weeks on this diet plan i could bearly lift my head up i nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights not to mention hardly staying awake while at work i thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of atkins , but i was never tired on atkins i do n't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs or what the problem was all i know is i am happily following atkins and losing much more rapidly than i did on this cad plan in two weeks i lost 6 lbs on cad 14 on atkins you figure it out
this book , above all others , reveals the breakdown of classical \( libertarian \) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today although the first part of the work , being a refutation of edmund burke 's silly nonsense , is stellar , and is well worth reading regardless , the second part , the chapter on ways and means in particular , is composed of the most despicable , anti liberty doctrines that one can find what paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state , replete with progressive taxation , subsidies for child birth , and other fine statist amenities thus , as all of these things are , in his words , to be claimed as rights , the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever it is indeed sad that thomas paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty in truth , he is actually one of its worst enemies , as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression , revolution , and reason , he sabotages his entire political philosophy
i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts , but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments as i was flipping through the book , i found x rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore , and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
anyone that knows anything about milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs , and contributed much more to society than people like james stewart , who often act like parasites at the expense of others
i recently saw this book on the bargain bin this book was pure garbage , by two arrogant 20 somethings in clown suits basically they are saying valuations do n't matter since they wrote the book , it has been prooven that their philosophy , approached over the long term , produces some great damaging losses the book may be useful during the next bubble , which if history serves , will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three ring circus in the sky to the dungeon with these two knaves
our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book as the facilitator , i was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection the writing is disjointed to the point that ms krauss loses her reader then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters , the reader is left extremely frustrated i really cannot imagine how ms krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews
i am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book i guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans , but i just do n't see what was great , or even good , about this story
before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead as it turns out i made the best decision all i can say is `thank you fellow reviewers' this book was definitely not worth the purchase price my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a skilled writer it has everything to do with his lack of insight that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary i read the book , waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book
the book jacket for the ruins offers a ca n't miss premise a group of post grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger it 's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach but 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket
the book the lost continent is an amazing captivating read bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions this cd totally kills that first of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute , sometimes to the point where you ca n't understand him and second , they abridged the crap out of it , cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire second half of the book ! while the book is amazing , this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs
i found this book very boring tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper
what a waste of time this was like sitting through a very boring business course i was never interested in turning the page i would have liked to see more of carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story instead i felt like a robot was telling this story very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else i forced myself to finish this a huge diaappointment do n't waste your money
i am a huge fan of kathy reichs' novels and of the tv series , bones however , this book was quite a disappointment to me i did not care for the way the author wrote dialogue brennan 's dialog is not that simplimatic on the tv program , and she certainly would never say , where at ! \? the author way overused the joke where brennan did not know what that means
this is a badly written , repetitive and self serving account , largely , of the foolishness of portflio insurance that things which are just like something else may not be so in reality , and that magic fixes in the market \( which after all fly in the face of the rational expectations efficient market hypotheses which often are built into the view of the market being relied on \) i guess needs to be pointed out regularly , since hope of quick , uninformed , and painless fixes seem to reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed on jacobs does point out such problems for a particular , rather bizarre episode , and suggests , not too coherently , that such scams are still prevalent however , he does this in a horribly repetitive and self laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued
design of book is very poor pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story the translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
ageless body is deepak 's attempt to neutralize the word old as in old age the writer has a knack for making common words , like body , mind and self , into profound concepts his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound
this book is so full of misinformation that i shudder to think \( since it is in the dummies series \) , that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog
you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library
i 'll preface this by saying i'm a cryer i cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining i cried all the way through superman returns i did not , however , shed one tear during message in a bottle
more hate books how could anyone write anything so wrong
i started reading this book expecting to like it it 's historical , related to little women , won the pulitzer , does n't feel like fluff , etc however i had a really difficult time getting into the book
while i found the writing style good and the information interesting , the actual diet was unrealistic , too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable i found myself longing for spices \( how bad could pepper really be \? \) and questioning the validity of their restriction i could n't stand the ground up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it \( or what i imagine that to be \)
author la guardia mentions how the lemba of africa have the jewish gene fine ! but when he deals \( in several pages mind you \) with the falashas \( also of africa \) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these jews not to be descended from the 12 tribes of israel despite the falashas 's longtime rep for possibly being a lost tribe of israel which , again , has now been 100 disproven through genetic studies
as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction , however midway it turns into a romance novel i give it 3 stars for holding my attention a good beach read that can get you thinking \( a little \) about a time past the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it 3 stars
being a student of photojournalizm in moscow , russia , i looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available i had studied one book on the subject by the russian author , but knowing that photography in the us is much more developed and professional i was striving to get a book by a professional photographer
although dead soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for doss , who has a tin ear for dialogue , dearly loves a cardboard character , and has no sense of plot , it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities
the winner and absolute truth made me continue reading baldacci books his last few books christmas train and split second were awful now baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats that was the last money i ever spend on a baldacci book , i even threw out his good books shut up baldacci and write fiction books your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world
a friend going through the same problems as i am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me , as well i was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions if i could actually use the information to help myself , all the better i was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through , so i struggled through it , expecting it to get easier to read it did n't it 's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and i'm really sorry because i'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting , but i just ca n't get past that page 104 i normally refuse to leave a book half unread , but this just has to be an exception because every time i pick it up i fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages
this is the worst , most depressing piece of fiction i have ever read there is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration and after a while , their actions just become inexplicable the author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book it starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of neil gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions additionally , the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands , nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease what is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all unlike some of stephen king 's work \( ie the stand \) , there is absolutely no redeeming thread here no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil it 's evil in evil vs evil surrounded by evil all i can say is that this book is ugly , ugly , ugly at least writers like joyce carol oats and joseph conrad 's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness , but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable the choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all i suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as i could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence , i literally stopped mid sentence and chose to never read this author 's work again it 's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist , dave mckean , who maybe has n't completely gone over to the dark side like neil has his association with dave mckean is the only reason i even opened up the book and maybe a little because the title intrigued me but it 's unfortunate that the industry rewards clever works such as mr gaiman 's with undue praise i 've never so strongly disliked a book have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book \? well , do n't believe the hype , this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with x men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you
if julia glass had not set the bar so high with three junes , i would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2 there are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the national book award gave ms glass unconditional confidence in her writing , and character development in particular she seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around as another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed transparant reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what ms glass \( a privileged white woman of a certain age \) imagines teenagers , or new mexicans , or black chauffeurs , or hispanic nannies , or even gay people to be like she is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them the teenagers and the santa fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures greenie might be the most believable , and although i understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy alan , i was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with the other charlie he was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth \( even temporarily \) losing your child over with saga , she manages to develop her most sympathetic character , but saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end even the brief appearance of fenno , who i loved in three junes , lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky all and all , a very disappointing second novel you have to wonder , since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character , what good is her editor \?
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent , he had a crappy upbringing , that does not make for a good book
when i read this , i was not expecting to become a commie , but at least i was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories \( especially re jews \) that the authors came up with
this seemed too long and too drawn out
simple arithmetic and you know it 's stupid to expect much from a 227 content book that attempts to tell the success stories and forumlas of 55 business leaders definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4 13 pages so i had lowered my standard before i read it still i had been quite disappointed all passages were columns published previously on ibd written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data history and success formula , primarly on the former i am sorry that i could gain little knowledge insight \( that i really wanted to learn how they succeeded \) during the reading i felt even worse after reading from the previous reviewer that the content had been available on the net in short , please give this book a pass !
the most anticipated book in the history of poker ! exclaims a blurb on the cover well , if so , i can tell you that a lot of people have been , or are going to be , very disappointed comparing the classic super system from 1978 with this book is , to paraphrase mark twain , like comparing lightning to the lightning bug
i'm in a good mood today , and feeling generous hence the two stars secrest learned that rodgers could be a rotten person , that he drank and was a womanizer she then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length i did n't count the words , but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on rodgers and hammerstein not to mention the post hammerstein years we learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory it 's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums i 've kept most of my theater books , except for this one it went to the used book store
someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of daniel silva books and got them removed ! hmm , i wonder who that could be
i 've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks , and i could n't wait to read dear john well , there was no reason to rush it starts out okay , but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him , instead of just pouting over her for most the book
i 'd heard the buzz \( both pro and con \) and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and does n't let go mercy stands out from all the rest you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
of the 7 or so grisham novels ive read this one is my least favorite
if you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy , then this is the book for you this book has no insight on anything it is vague it doesnt explain anything in detail it talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing , but that is as far as that goes its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more ! you might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor it has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high risk pregnancy
i find some parts of didion 's book very relatable , at least when she 's exploring her feelings of shock , the superstitious feelings , and the obsessive re living of her husband 's last few days and death but these sections become less and less frequent as the book continues , and it all seems to devolve
beware of the everyman 's library edition of this book \( green hardcover , ribbon marker , isbn 0 679 40564 x \) book v dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted according to the introduction , this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low i wish i had known this before i ordered the book since now i have to buy a different edition in order to read book v what a ripoff
this guy 's box is missing a few tools most of the stuff he quotes as fact is not supported in real life he 's full of crap everybody knows walking is good for you , but kevin t starts his chapter on walking by saying that 'when you take your dog for a walk , he \( or she \) poops well la de f ing da is n't that why you take your dog for a walk because you do n't want him \( or her \) to poop in the house then there 's his statement that if you put your teflon pan on high heat and have a parakeet on your shoulder , the bird will keel over dead because of the poisonous gasses and another thing , who ever heard of an acidic body \? \? \? i think i know what planet trudeau came from uranu

i really liked suzanne summers i 've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video when i saw her on the today show advertising this book i could n't wait to get it
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs \( more than the other 2 \) , and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , collapse a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now rk
when our book club selected this novel , i was enthusiastic the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story however , after the first chapter or so , i kept waiting for the big wow factor and it never came i found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well developed like other readers , i finished it out of obligation , but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it
while i enjoy adventure stories for the casual reading they are and have read all of cussler 's , i was disturbed by a lot of the assumptions in this and other of his recent books this is transparently hawkish an ultra conservative defense of the questionable actions of the very furthest right of the political spectrum \( one could even suspect it was commissioned or at least underwritten by these elements \) it reflects the current culture that decrees all means justify the end as long it benefits the right people cussler 's recent books portray that it 's okay for americans to go into other countries with which we are not at war and kill its citizens for some secret government agenda that it 's okay for our us government to hire out black ops in secret because it 's against our laws to do so openly through the years , i 've tolerated cussler 's blatant sexism , juvenile writing style , improbable exploits of cartoonish heroes however , he has veered into political territory that offends me but even more , terrifies me that it may be the truest part of his stories
using this book and cd rom depends upon being able to download the customized settings , so that the reader 's photoshop , for example , behaves the same way as the author 's photoshop however , my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the cd rom furthermore , this author does n't start at a dummies level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons , so i had trouble following along overall , this was n't much help for me in my quest to learn photoshop from a baseline of complete ignorance
horribly disappointing
huge disappointment trace was n't that good either having read all scarpetta 's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one however , the downhill trend seems to continue these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing save your money , do n't buy it i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far , so i wo n't go into the plot or rather lack of a real plot details

my mother in law was actually responsible for billy milligan while he was in the athens state hospital in ohio i 've had a chance to read this book , and although very good , what my mother in law tells me is much , much different
a very disappointing book , and again , makes me very wary of any item on a new york times best seller list or any other list , and really any big name reviewer recommendation
dr northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies , stages of life and medical procedures however , i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced , with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women as a catholic whose best teachers were strong minded , compassionate religious sisters , i felt offended by her slur against nuns i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing , but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research
the whole concept of this book as well as the honesty of the undertaking i'm not buying it the author 's effort is half a ed at best
this book is the reason i 've read only one john updike novel i was so disgusted by the people , the plot , and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that i never read another updike i thought the characters were completely unrealistic
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia is this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note at the end of the book we read sep 10 , 1990 nov 10 , 1993 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted
i bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned it looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information
this novel is set in the 40 's , when elizabeth short \( the black dahlia \) was found murdered , her body cut in two the characters revolve around the investigation of this incident , altnough her name is changed the chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers one , an amoral cop , the other , a catholic priest , monsignor , businessman , whatever you want to call him neither one is likable , the 40 's cop jargon is incomprehensible , and the catholic politics building programs are boring however , the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow
i have loved each and every one of jane hamilton 's other novels and highly recommend them the book of ruth , a map of the world , short history of a prince and disobedience this book , sadly , does not rank among them it feels forced and uninteresting , with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios i 've already paid for it , so i 'll probably try to finish it , but do n't waste your time or money read another hamilton instead
this is a great book if you have the right teacher the book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you i also recomend that you make sure your copy has a cd rom the study guide and website are great tools too they help a lot
this book was very disappointing i loved her 1st two books so when this book came out i was very excited after reading it , i found it was rather dull and not very funny there were very few parts that actually made me laugh , unlike her 1st two books
i read exactly half the book and stopped based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending , that was a good decision as it is there went hours of my life i wo n't get back ! the book is silly and laughable the premise sounded great but the book is bad really bad
robert kiyosaki 's books are all the same thing re packaged over and over again this book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it 's readers a lot of time he writes in an arrogant , condescending manner that is hard to stomach i would hate to have been his real dad it 's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of rich dad it 's offensive and disturbing
the author lives in a dream world and is not in touch with the business work environment of today her advice is old fashioned and out of date many better textbooks on ethics available
i had this one figured out by the second chapter too predictable and shallow hopefully , the next stone book will actually be worth reading
a disappointing book about a fabulous story the book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and , if you look at the chapter notes , this appears to be how it was researched
even with the questionable veracity , i enjoyed frey 's first book , a million little pieces , since it stayed true to an addict 's experience leonard , on the other hand , came off as pure fantasy , with very little substance even the description of frey 's struggle was too contrived to be believable it was not even interesting as fiction
at the height of socialist popularism in england , cir 1944 , george orwell , a leading proponent of socialism , believing in its promises as did many , if not most of eurpose 's leading intellectuals and politicians , wrote a review of hayek 's famous book , the road to serfdom orwell wrote the review in the observer , london april 9 , 1944
this has to be one of the most ridiculous books i have ever read at one point the authors ask if money equals security , would n't you feel safe walking through a major american city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist \? if money really did equal security , you would ! i stopped reading after that
if you have fond memories of ms steele , or no memory at all because you 're new to her , please do n't read this book
i heard about this book growing up but did n't read it until just recently \( a middle aged adult \) and i have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written , i e , it was so shocking and disgusting ! such filth ! i mean , that 's why i heard about the book when i was growing up but as so many others have already pointed out , it is tame by today 's standards i also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the female protagonist is completely a male fantasy the book 's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man 's part now , you see , what struck me about sir clifford 's situation , and lady chatterley 's , for that matter , is if they really loved each other , his paralysis from the waist down would n't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms there are other things that can be done , yes \? in fact , quite possibly connie would have had an orgasm for the first time ! \( ahem , women readers will know what i mean \) but clifford treated connie poorly with or without the lack of sex issue , i think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway which to me , just goes to show that a man wrote the book a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick
i bought this book on a friend 's recommendation if i had been in a book store and could have read a page or two i would have known immediately it was not the type of book i would read i'm sure it 's wonderful for those who like it i passed it on to a friend
this story was about a young brother trying to make it in life
this book is filthy i had to take a shower after i read it why does n't he get a job \? why does he have to live in france \? why does n't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers \? so many questions people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned it was banned because it 's a bad book
i enjoyed the first 3 books of the women 's murder club did n't like too much the 4th \( of july \) , but the 5th is just bad ! what 's the plot \? there is no plot ! 2 serial killer stories try to share the pages of this not such a page turner , the 1st mystery \( car girls \) get solved mid way throught the book and i bet plenty of readers wo n't remember it by the end of this painfull read by trying to develop 2 stories , patterson gets our interest for none the most sad thing of all is that i used to like to women 's murder club members , but now they all seem so unreal , remote from anything actually likeable and it 's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club , in the most stupid , artificial way really not much to save this book , it 's even badly written do n't know if patterson thinks about writting a 6th , but do n't count on me next time
i bought this off of the new york public library website what an utter waste of 40 the book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful , but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while the worst part is the software that you are supposed to use to catalog your books first of all , it is difficult to install this is always a sign of a inferior product no product that was properly qa 'd would be released in such condition second of all , the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet i could literally use excel or ms access to catalog my books just as well as this software you actually have to input every piece of data associated with a book there is no excuse for anyone with an internet connection to have to manually input book data i state again it is very surprising that the new york public library would include this product in their stores it is a major , major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there
i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that having said that i did not like this book
i bought this book with big aspirations of another joy of cooking with a little upscale to it while i must say the design of the book is fabulous \( i am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook 's design \) , the recipes leave much to pine for i do n't like that most of the ingredients are nothing i normally keep in the house and i am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them i have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and i have owned the book for over a year i will stick to joy of cooking for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen
maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender but , by the reviews here , all by women , i can see that jance writes to that crowd her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue , the insulin bottle jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time if you want a good mystery read coben , crais , patterson or michael connely
al gore is making a good road to tell us the facts on global warming , but he is missing the fact that in 3 4 years we will have the new ice age coming and billion of people on earth will die and he is missing 40 60 of the cause of the global warming the book is good and bad we can stop this global warming in one month but we cant' do it untill we will expose the real cause of it think about in one month we can stop it each month \( in the next 2 years \) we will postpone the truth is just bad
this book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille very weak and ordinary
i have read some memoirs of the 2nd ww from a german standpoint and this was not one of the better although very fascinating at times it was also oddly detached and some of the stories about his sniping seemed made up it sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable
the kite runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up , stay focused , and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until now
i purchased this book to gain a better insight about aspergers instead , it left me with many unanswered questions the book is the equivalent to a boring , monotonous `dear diary' that gets stuck in one era his college years and his interest in music \( this is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college , and music is all he knows \) yet i craved more details , i wanted to know more about mr shores' childhood , his parents , the stims , and the chaos details !
the story opens well and hooks the reader however , the ending is a disappointment and comes across as cliche and predictable i gave it two stars because there was not a category for a 1 and a half
the audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep not a good thing while drivin
if you want to spend 4 times as much money , 8 times as much time , and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately politely refuse then buy this book ! the author clearly has no clue that less is often more
i originally bought this title when it came out as a four part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection
i did not like the book it did have some interesting points to consider , but it did not seem like discipline to me i am more of a love and logic fan i think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior \( or do n't care \) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them , which this book says not to do i just do n't agree with it
myth 1 american women live under patriarchy
i just finished listening to as much of the book on cd as i could stomach the minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating the words forhead , perp , peruse , crim , and finger were repeated over and over and over what might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone 's clothing , spouses , children , and thinking
this book is so outdated all the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980 's and earlier , which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past there are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
its a good book to draw examples of idustries in different stages of technology evolution however it is lacking in theoretical content ,
and i suspect this is what has happened to james lee burke the dave robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now and that is tragic , considering the promise of the early books , which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful in the electric mist with confederate dead
i am newly preg too i went out and got this book without reading any reviews i sum it up this way a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension i ca n't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a great old time enjoying those pains you will be feeling ! ie and all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet ha ha ha
dr rieux , the main character of the novel , moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague
not very scary , too long , and poor character development there are a lot of good reviews about the book maybe i missed something
f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what 's his name gives them and remember , this doctor , is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives , so why do you \? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life
this book shows how robert has been lying all along he talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless ok then , how did robert make the monthly payment \? why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a porsch as a bum \? this guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses he is a conman and a good one thats why hes a motivational speaker it takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money do n't fall for this conman ! this book contradicts what robert has been preaching in previous books robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless that would be odd but it is n't odd because robert is a professional liar
this was the first book by danielle steele that i have read and it will be the last i read by her i was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over rated author the story was very drawn out and i caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring if you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo
i have very mixed feelings about this book and ca n't say i enjoyed it all that much i love the story of sappho , what little is known of it , and so i picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism , research , and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of lesbos but monsters \? centaurs \? i mean , the story of sappho 's life is not the story of the odyssey and for the life of me i do n't understand why author erica jong decided to give her readers a combination of greek heroine and clash of the titans
i usually enjoy ms maron 's deborah knott books very much the characters are well drawn and give deep insight into southern life this one , however , is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional the first murder does n't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just there the second one involving dwight 's son \( who is a very poorly developed child character \) and his ex wife is not very interesting
i 've read a lot of the books in the series , and hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers , but i have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries my main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author his well crafted mysteries almost always hold water , but not this one i whole heartedly recommend most of hillerman 's other jim chee joe leaphorn novels , but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill , this is not the book to pick up
the story was slow , predictable and boring i am still amazed i hung in there and finished reading it it 's a dud in my opinion
the sub header to this book could very well be all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
one ca n't be sure that this book is n't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad , that if this were n't crappy , it would n't sell even for someone who believes in csik 's theory of flow , this book is a no win blow out instead of making clear statements backed by evidence , the book 's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions there is no reason to read this , when his original popularization , flow , more carefully and clearly summarizes csikszentmihalyi 's interesting research
i was expecting a substitute for the classic photoshop channel chops by monroy and friends it trivializes the subject with how to unlock the hidden power of channels blah blah
i do n't get the impression from reading the book that the authors have even tried to analyzed the financial holdings that was set up it is the thinnest book on enron that i read , for very good reason
the storyline is way over the top , the plot is very poor , the red neck america knows best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying still , i 've red worse books but not many
having read clive cussler adventures for over 10 years , i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book the father , who does not stay with his son , decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else 's country that is perfectly justified !
i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character \? people are just too different , too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history , socio economic patterns , religion , family , etc but the specific results are just that , specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page myself , i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you
i agree with one the comments posted below the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one dimensional character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him over the course of the book he does n't change , he 's unsympathetic , and by the time we 've reached page 500 , we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10 i found myself dying to get to the end of this book , just so i could start another book with some substance and some well drawn characters
you 'd be better off using the internet to figure the game out the guide feels super cluttered , it 's almost hard to read and it does n't tell you everything at the right time i think it feels cluttered because there 's too many pictures in it every page has at least 7 or 8 images on it the best thing about the guide is the production value but i did n't buy for that
book is out of date with modern economic thought essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets
really not sure why this book received such good reviews , because it had nothing new expected from the cover some reviews of outfits worn by different individuals pictured
if you have n't read anything on e commerce at all , or if you 're a total newbie , the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business for someone who is already in the business or has already done some research , this book merely repeats a lot of well known tips even then , some of the tips , like in section on affiliate programs , are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic
this book is built around the idea i wish it were true it is true while this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives , if you 're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life \( i e intellectual integrity \) , you 'd be better off buying an introduction to probability
compared to his other superb books , this is one is tedious and boring the overall thesis is a stretch trying to find equivalences between pre industrial \( and pre printing press \) 13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors at a minimum comparing a world in which 90 of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow
bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know the show was much better , you should buy that kwame is much smater and deserved the job i can tell that this book is another promotional tool do n't waste even a cent on this book
my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths i immediately fell in love with the stories , the prose , the poetry , and so went on to buy this complete volume while it is nice to have all borges 's stories in one place , and at a reasonable price , the language does n't really hold up for me the translation is well , not sloppy , but too simple , like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade i have nothing against andrew hurley , but his translation of borges leaves me cold i 'd give borges 5 stars out of 5 , but hurley \? no more than 2
found recipes dated , layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how to is useful , its generally from another era bought gourmet cook book instead
when i bought this book , i did n't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of friedman 's collumns in the times i think friedman is a great author with lots of great insights , but he is n't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as i would have liked in a bunch of detached 750 1000 word segments since the sections are arranged chronologically , there also is n't the opportunity to tie the themes together
the very title for the book i con despite its cleverness , should reveal the lack of any objectivity , or class for that matter , from the authors , jeffrey s young and william l simon
like most great diplomatic moments , successes and failures alike , decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the camp david debacle can appear even then , disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after given the wide interest in the israeli arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations , new works exploring the crucial climax at camp david remain welcome some dismiss mr swisher 's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team , but instead was responsible at camp david only for negotiations that seems to me unfair clayton swisher clearly did considerable leg work to prepare this text sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect
the religion of peace is at it again ! in response to the popes words , muslims all over the world respond with violence , destruction , rage , hatred , burning down buildings , burning papal effigies , issuing fatwas against the pope , and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back wow , such peace from a religion of peace if islam is a religion of peace , then all the guns in the world are pink flowers , and every nuclear bomb , a soft feathery pillow violence for words destruction for speech please ! this is a religion of war , and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america
very little plot , which is boring
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the pre five in a row w our preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother w borderline personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's what so ever \( if i need a break away , she hunts down my poor husband , all my relatives and friends ugh \) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality
aside from the 1958 championship game and the 1968 super bowl , the actual football games got very short shrift the 1964 championship game did n't even get a mention ! whole years are virtually ignored very , very little discussion of unitas' career and his impact on the game mostly just anecdotes about family , friends , and teammates , and way too much space devoted to post mortem comments from same i think i learned way more about johnny sample and gino marchetti and jim parker from this book than i learned about unitas and that 's not saying much there 's a lot of padding in this book but precious little information and a lot of the anecdotes will be familiar if you 're a football fan wait for the paperback if you 're a unitas devotee otherwise do n't bother
this is the first book by shaara i have read and , if his other works are like this , it is also the last
this book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos hispanics however it 's primarily philisophical it 's more confusing than inspiring it 's great for those studying for a phd , but will not inspire average latinos to action this book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view , although a few writers do express some pan latino thoughts
j k rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way
the premise of this story started off smartly i was drawn in as a reader as case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away but from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time case takes the predictable rout finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache
keynes was no doubt an influential economist his theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post new deal economic policies of the united states and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like imf however , his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the u s particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation \( an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to keynesism \) we have keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government read planning for freedom or socialism by ludwig von mises instead
i was really disappointed with this book a lot of the recipes are identical to one another , with just one ingredient eg a different type of vegetable substituted with no pictures and not much more content , i really regret buying it
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels , and because i'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there
lies , half truths , spin and glitz of course there is some truth sprinkled in self promoting tv stars are more interested in being self promoting tv stars than truth theres just not enough time for both at best it 's entertainment , at worst it misleads the children and finally they are all biblically illiterate so be careful especially with tbn
because you wait and wait , and then three do n't turn up at once
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
wright presents no new information about al qaeda , leaves out plenty of information about al qaeda and neglects the usa side of the road to 9 11 understanding qutb 's radicalization of islam is important to understanding why ayman al zawahiri and usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the usa found a use for them as an enemy what cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the united states by the neoconservatives and followers of leo strauss the united states is not a unique and beautiful snowflake the liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by strauss as destructive of the society of the usa and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about us exceptionalism after the the soviet union was kicked out of afghanistan , both qutb and strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it since the cold war the us has been working off of the friend and enemy model of policy formulated by carl schmitt and 9 11 presented the us with what schmitt called a state of exemption if you think jihad was the cause of 9 11 , ask yourself why richard clarke found bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to iraq hours after 9 11 see the bbc documentary , the power of nightmares or from secularism to jihad sayyid qutb and the foundations of radical islamism by adnan a musallam or the political ideas of leo strauss by shadia drury for a better analysis of qutb and strauss than wright has in his book if you prefer to stick with fiction about the road to 9 11 , check out patrick s johnston 's novel mission accomplished
if you 've read one gary null book , you 've read them all he is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject , but when i buy two books with different titles by gary null and find they are the same , i'm pretty annoyed his early books were taken directly from herbert sheldon 's natural hygience material , which i assume must not have been copyrighted , and i felt ripped off then , in the 70 's as i did recently when amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books
unfortunately , instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis , justifications , and problems with overarching property rights , delong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists delong covers some of the same ground as congressman richard pombo in his 1996 this land is our land , simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions delong 's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill founded delong 's politics overcome his analysis this book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions \( \) his political agenda overwhelm his rational
this was certainly not one of cornwell 's best works it was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one it read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel
this book really irritated me i loved mayes 's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one the concept , a year of traveling to different locations , seemed like it would be really interesting combined with mayes' fresh perspectives , enthusiasm for discovery , feisty opinions and poetic descriptions but somehow it did n't work
the work of a 12 year old without talent phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy , inappropriate similies story line is absurd if this were koontz 's first novel , no publisher would touch it
hateful liberals once again undermine their so called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the us population they claim to be tolerant and open minded toward all lifestyles , religions , races etc but that open mindedness obviously should n't apply to people who disagree with them throughout the book , moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people if you like this book , i also recommend mein kampf by adolf hitler both books are jam packed full of hate
who published these weak translations \? yup , they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper \? b needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality
i bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers let me be candid what the hell were they reading \? this book is simply insipid , implausible and a waste of time get this for a premise rich , geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the connecticut nutmegs ! nutmegs for a major league team \? \? ! ! yeah , right it gets better he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the c list movies he produces ok hold on to your seats , here comes the good part she is going to be his star player on this major league baseball team ! ! why , because in college she was an excellent athlete so some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball ! ! am i the only one who thinks this is plain stupid oh , yeah there 's a murder along the way parker \( author \) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise i ca n't think of a reason why it got published
having read the millionaire next door , as well as most if not all of the classics in this category , i expected life altering experiences with this book
most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page the books of richard dawkins , whom rose selects as his special target , illustrate this well readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain how one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts \? yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in rose 's book there is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions , but almost no observations from behavioural biology nonetheless , in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments , dismissing dawkins and daniel dennett as people who either no longer do science or never did it what a pity , therefore , that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book there are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave , and that 's about it
the first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that , the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book i think the story would have been more credible if barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it without those details , the book seemed unfinished it was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain boring in my opinion
i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character \? people are just too different , too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history , socio economic patterns , religion , family , etc but the specific results are just that , specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page myself , i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you
it has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed the canadian eskimo dog is now referred to as the canadian inuit dog out of respect for the inuit people he has the dog 's height wrong , and the weight range is much too high this leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed , who 's to say that it 's not wrong on other breeds too \?
two main comments firstly , the book is mistitled or i misread the meaning of the title and i would be delighted to return it this is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform tricks with much on showmanship i have no interest in that but i do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master 's care of their puppy and mature dog problems handlers encounter in greeting of your dog with other dogs and people
i 've read only a few of hillerman 's previous leaphorn chee novels i 've enjoyed what i 've rtead , though they are an acquired taste , and i do n't indulge in them very often i tend to enjoy the earlier , more active years of joe leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi retired unofficial advisor to jim chee' phase
this book is 'oragnized' into sections getting started , organizing room by room , organizing finances , organizing time , organizing home life , and organizing transitions
i like looking at old pictures and old letters , but i thought when i bought the book that i would actually be looking in the history of someone 's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case it is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book the pictures are n't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters , so you know nothing of the authors , no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything in other words , no story behind it whatsoever just a disappointing collection
in my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels , i came across this interesting find summer of 2005
i will be brief penroses writing is mediocre , his drawings obfuscate more than clarify
perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out , but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie the story involves brain surgery gone bad , with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control the end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as i suspected from the very beginning of the book
many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable \( i happened to be 13 when i read it \) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault
this was a less than stellar sequal to the women of the silk but it did finish the story of pei to some extent i found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believabl
the story was slow , predictable and boring i am still amazed i hung in there and finished reading it it 's a dud in my opinion
the title grabbed me because i have been noticing for , oh about 14 years now , the decline of the truth in this country unfortunately , this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is \( definition of irony i believe \)
who better to write a book about morons than flynn \? an abyssmally miserable book with so little substance i was surprised it did n't float out of my hands it 's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic two wrongs do n't make a right , non sequiturs galore , red herrings they 're all there
i wanted to like this book it 's a great size for carrying around to dip into however , i 'd say about a third , or maybe more , i have n't counted , are anonymous here 's an example life is filled with possibilities p31 now i do n't know about you , but i 'd hardly class that as great stuff from great minds then i read decide what is worthwhile and follow through with it and i'm beginning to yawn when i came to above all , life should be fun and always keep a window open in your mind for new ideas and i'm just about ready to throw the book into the garbage also , the format of the book is terrible someone decided to put every quote into a little frame , so you get four quotes on a page
the kite runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up , stay focused , and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i remember reading the chamber distinctly somehow , this book doesnt even near that standard the story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns the characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out
uldrich makes big bucks on the public speaking circuit discussing nanotechnology i suspect this book was published for no other reason than to provide some credentials to support the speaking engagements his most recent books published since this one have been one about george marshall and another about lewis and clark real cutting edge technology there ! nope , do n't buy it
the ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book it was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real ludlum books
i have been a devoted hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical , the story is just so silly i found it hard to keep my attention focused i compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which i do with my children on occasion sorry , i just could n't finish it
i wavered awhile between three stars and two stars , because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as sony and akio morita seem to deserve at least three however , in the end , the book 's errors just piled too high it opens well , with the story of sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half wrecked department store just after world war ii , to becoming one of the world 's great companies this is a fascinating and inspiring story , and morita tells it with flair
joshua 6 23 , 21 joshua said to the people of israel , the lord has given you the city of the all silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord
i was more upset with this book than anyother i 've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing
galbraith 's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure his ideas are sound , though he has a very off putting pompous delivery in fact , his verbosity and poor structure is so bad , that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind numbing experience the book really needs to go back to an editor
mr galbraith is smart , accomplished , and learned man who knows what is best for all us his view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling , mr galbraith aims to be `practical' and just further defines the third way nonetheless , his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the european model of society many of his proposals are so silly you wo n't take them seriously but sadly , he is quite serious for example , mr galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life of course , he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding neither does he address what one should do if their life is un rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life and , of course , who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone \( who has a life that is deemed too rewarding \) for someone who has life that is too un rewarding mr galbraith fails to convince the reader of the practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between socialism and capitalism , and saying nothing new
even the avid trekie reader of the star trek science fiction novels , movies and television series must suspend disbelief , when he finds captain kirk saying beam me up , scotty but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort , when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world wide rapture though the characters and their roles are fictitious , the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer
my problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages ! we did n't notice it until book 4 of 6 , but 80 pages were gone ! now , amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed up set this is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages !
while the author rehashes some basic business writing theory , she consistently fails to follow her own rules
if you walk into b and flip through \( not even buy ! \) the other well known recommended pregnancy books you 'll get much more information than what douglas offers
hmm , quite a disappointment , especially after splurging on the hardcover edition set as a kind of rockies rear window , this is one slow story endless pages of crazy making when i 'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through finally skipped ahead to finish the book i had really looked forward to angels fall , too \( if you are a roberts fan , do n't spend the money on the hardcover , wait for the paperback , go to the library , or borrow from a friend not worth the price
there were several good scenes , but they did n't make up for the rest of the book not worth reading
this book was easy enough to read , it just was n't what i expected from quindlen i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating , in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out the back and forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing , and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past , whereas the previous paragraph was present time although i got used to that writing style , i always found it annoying the storyline itself never sold me either a typical , young sew your wild oats boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the perfect father i just did not find such an occurrence likely and , as a mother myself , all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm anyway the whole story seemed far fetched and disjointed to me , and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many , many years
just awful
i was recommended borges' works by one of his innumerable over educated sycophants and i will never forget the tremendous time i wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life 's work \( when i should have been writing my dissertation \) each time i read one of his pedantic , mediocre peices of short fiction , i was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that i would like other examples of his work if i continued reading since all of his stories are so unique i found the exact opposite to be true one story after another about mazes , mirrors , mystical mathematical formulas and books , books , books the ideas were transperant , the language boring in the extreme his poetry is trite who needs this \? borges reads like a petulant graduate student at university of chicago who failed repeatedly to get his her short fiction published in the atlantic monthly particularly among academics , literary elites and like people , many seem to cite borges and worship his genius more than read him and certaintly no one reads him critically i read most of his work , and i can tell you , outside of a few interesting turns of phrase , you 'd be better off reading a yale dissertation on the semiotics of self superiority people incessantly talk about how imaginative borges is the vast majority of popular sf and fantasy writers are more imaginative even many of the despicable magical realist geniuses make borges look rather plain borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of manhattan or cambridge if you 're this kind of pompous fellow , you 'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of luis by your side and a series of mirrors , as it were , slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans substantiation with this benighted old librarian if you 're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters , enjoying nuanced use of language , and grasping subtle , daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter , run far , far away from jorge luis borges even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews the adulation of borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among \( those who think themselves \) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction i think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment , relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams , and not an example of literary genius in that sense , 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work , and that 's about as much attention as he deserves
i read exactly half the book and stopped based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending , that was a good decision as it is there went hours of my life i wo n't get back ! the book is silly and laughable the premise sounded great but the book is bad really bad
i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly there are a lot of good books out there , dan harrington 's the very best , but this isnt one of them too much ego here and not enough helpful information
i use the notebook and a walk to remember as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses , i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer , i was more satisfied with the rescue taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl , etc , etc ,
ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality to her there is no middle ground i am an educated , well travelled adult who while born in the united states , spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded to be called a communist , a traitor , and an enemy of america just because i do n't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on
the is by far the weakest grisham novel i 've ever read the first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist \( joel backman more about him later \) wanders italy for nearly 200 pages , learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with italian carictatures that would make chico marx cringe when grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense , it 's all for naught , as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending
not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected i did n't really connect with the main characters i was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects \( the lights \) it seemed like a mystery love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story
if the kranks really did what they set out to do and skip christmas , that would have been a good story the end
you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library
it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat , then do n't waste your time
what a disappointment ! based on reviews , i could n't wait to get this book do n't let the 48 pages fool you half of the pages are pictures , and the half with writing on them are double spaced with wide margins took me all of 20 minutes to read \( and only that long because of all the page turning \) nothing wrong with being concise except that the philosophy here is overly simplified quindlen goes to great lengths to equate pefection with conformity and condemning it as inauthentic i do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves \( i e , wanting to be the perfect mother , perfect daughter , perfect wife , perfect businesswoman \) therefore , it creates warm , fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being boring unfortunately , to claim that well behaved women do n't make good lawyers or businesswomen just does n't follow this is not deep reading 20 minutes \? do n't waste your time
my understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus , the information age \( which starts with the network society \) if this is so , i am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy this is a really bad piece of sociology , characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis why did i give it two stars instead of one then \? well , it does have some ok parts catsell 's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism he also presents some convincing data \( gathered by other people \) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on line world , alienating them from the world of face to face interaction this happens in the case of a few troubled people , but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off line relationships the rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image , with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology this is , frankly , ludicrous reductionism it does n't even stand up to a simple test of chronology a lot of the developments that castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid 1990s as castells himself admits , businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene , and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements on top of this , castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked , whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations i'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena castells does see some of the problems with the new network society loss of job security and the digital divide , for instance but he tends to downplay these and his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same more internet access , more network social organization talk about a narrow vision
this novel would be better suited for the stage it reads like a play , often
please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are i hated this book it took me at least 6 months to read this because i could not force myself to read it but that being said i also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that i had looked at some reviews and realized that was what i was getting myself into i read 'as i lay dying' in high school and hated it too there is no plot , and no point i hated it
it still amazes me that anyone takes gould seriously he is an admitted marxist , and he allows his social beliefs to influence science that is not science science is a dispasionate search for the truth i get the feeling reading this book that gould does n't like what the truth is , so he wants to shape the way we see the truth they used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun
j k rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers there are so many open ends in the story chartacters are not distinctly outlined tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
woolf 's style of writing \( changing between several characters' thoughts \) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio the paperback proved to be easier for me
this book is not what i thought i bought i was expecting information useful to left handers instead i found out why society belives left handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed i enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book by the way , it was written by a right handed person
when i picked up true believer , i was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters neither panned out this book is boring the characters are one dimensional and there is no mystery too much detail and not enough substance not sure what the point of the story was as i did n't get it
this book proves once again , that you do n't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market true believer is an all star team of cheap , shallow cliches there is no plot no one really believes anything , and everything is a contrived , superficial mish mash the dialoge has no depth , and when you 've had too much dialoge , there 's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters , thinking to themselves wow , is this bad message in a bottle was a great plot idea , but its been a slow , steady descent since then you might have a good laugh at it like i did , but otherwise i was very disappointed
i have 50 pages to go and i ca n't wait to finish this boring waste of time very predictable , sappy , sweet and quite meaningless i give it a minus 1
the number poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom , even if it is a number eisenberg 's number is the inverse of that draw down , or twenty five times well , there 's the rub , twenty five times what \? income \? expenses \? income less savings \? projected discretionary spending \? post mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses \? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants , experts , philosophers , and casual acquaintances eisenberg , a former esquire editor and short timer with lands end , ruminates about a simple question how much money do you need to feel secure \? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms happiness , comfort , excess consumption , ego and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be constructing a one year budget is hard enough constructing a thirty year budget is nearly impossible
this is , without question , the worst book ever written on one 's financial life to begin with , it 's useless zero information , zero new analysis of old information , zero advice , zero interesting anecdotes additionally , it 's rambling meandering from summaries of old data , to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel good blathering what exactly is this guy 's point \? no way to tell
this book has a lot of names i 'll give it that but , there are some relatively common names that are missing and so many invented names my favorite of the invented names are schmoopie and poogie as if these names will show up on a birth certificate ! !
i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow , what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list
the trouble starts early there is an apologetic preamble which states that the author \( s \) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community this is an enormous assumption about the general public 's knowledge both of video games and more so it 's history of design many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the tv spinoffs , most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look \( ed \) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment
if you are a man , you will not like this collection of feminist essays this book is worse than bad it is an abomination
this is the book dan brown 's bestseller the da vinci code is based on indeed , michael baigent et al have even sued brown in court , charging him with plagiarizing their book the ideas behind the da vinci code have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians obviously , this exposure affects holy blood , holy grail as well
eve dallas is a cop in the future , chasing drug dealers , killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of eve 's rich husband and ends up dead i hated this book , the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags
much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white or male for that matter though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each a not terribly risky venture , this
buy a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do instead snortland 's book is more of a feminist 's political treastise on how males and females are raised and nurtured versus a pragmatic approach on skills to identify potential threats and strategies to deal with them she does hype impact training which sounds like a beneficial program i bought it for my daughter , but read it first actually , i tried to read it halfway through the book i decided to toss it
although i really do like ripley 's writing and her stories , this one was shameful what she did to the memory of gwtw i have to blame this on the editors scarlett was not the colorful character as in gwtw in this so called sequel publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic
this is a revolutionary book it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology all of social interaction is a performance on a stage it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement the language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated there are some problems with clarity and structure the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me no sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book so if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start \( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction \)
i'm surprised that someone so seemingly intelligent does not know that stories and specific examples are what make a book interesting this book was totally devoid of them , but instead used vague generalizations from beginning to end i read the whole book and was waiting for it to get good it never did do n't waste your time or your money any positive review must have been written by the author 's friends i would rather eat cardboard that read this book again
i do not think the man who translated the koran here is a true muslim one cannot shuffle and reorder the suras to suit one 's own taste this man does not have the right to mess up our holy book in this way plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the ali version i have not been in a mosque yet that had this version of the koran on its shelves you can go into any mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the ali tranlation for free why waste your money on this infidel sham version \?
i would love to read a neutral book on barry bonds , i hate cheerleader type books about players but i also hate one sided ones as well the only good things he really has to say about bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous marge \( whom he then sarcastically remarks that bonds was only her second favorite player \)
i was disappointed with this purchase if you read the book jacket , you have gotten about all of the information out of it that 's coming
wow , i was expecting a fun , light read , and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to mishaps that happen to animals in zippy 's life well , i thought , next chapter will be better not the next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels ! every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it ! if you are sensitive to these things , i would not recommend the book i'm not sure i'm going to finish it at this rate granted , i am super sensitive to any animal suffering , but this is really overload i'm halfway through and so far this is the list the aforementioned chicken slaughter , a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement , another neighbor looking to poison her cat , dog sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later , her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred zippy 's pet chicken , joking about a neighbor enjoying puppy stew , keeping her two dogs penned up , torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds i mean , does that seem like a lot to you \? \? \? for a light hearted tender memoir \? \? \? \? jeez louise ! i ca n't sleep at night from this book
i picked this book up after reading both books in the bartimeus trilogy and was excited to see what else jonathan stroud could conjure up this book was a let down i just could n't get into the plot i even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie , especially for young children to read there are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci fi novel , rather than a book marketed for children and young teens the characters were unlikeable , and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention i was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing bartimeus trilogy books ! well , i figured i would add my two cents in and let people know i just did n't like this book
i have to preface this by saying that i absolutely love eating at the candle so delicious
do n't be excited about this book 's small size and light weight , the text needs more examples to support you while doing homework breif chapter explantions caused me to nearly fail my class was not a gret book , in fact many students complained to the dean regarding this book good luck

all over the place
you have to ask yourself , why did william grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary \? as you read the book , the answer comes quickly , before you 're even very far into the a 's apparently he did n't
i had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism instead i got a diatribe against western liberalism lee harris is the poster child for the modern john birchers , people who believe our way is not only the best way , its the only way in an increasingly global economic and political system , his view of the world can be said to be outmoded , at best quaint , at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years , we will need tolerance and inclusivness
i enjoy this work , lots of fresh observations and connections but having read it in the light of recent trends in the e biz world , it sounds thin and delusional a lot like tom peters after way too much espresso there are consequences from continually embracing change and , in my experience all of them are bad i wonder on what real world experience mr kelly bases his thinking my advice , embrace chaos and change , but do it very carefully because it will definitely have consequences truth beauty ! bv
the only explanation is that james paterson churned this dog out to make a buck i 've read a number of james patterson books and while i'm not a hard core fan , i 've enjoyed most of them i know this will outrage some patterson readers but i'm not much of a fan of alex cross who frankly i find boring as hell
not his best book , i thought waldo lost in new york is more authoritive i mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant , when he ca n't even rely on himself
mark twain once said that \( and i paraphrase \) the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read that is my experience with this book for some reason , a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists , and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt so i picked it up what a slog ! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton , a character who you barely get to know , and root for lucie manette the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge an admittedly cool concept maybe this book speaks to another era , maybe it 's past its prime , maybe i do n't have the required literary sensibilities , or maybe i could n't relate , but a tale of two cities bored me to tears
while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife i'm very tender when it comes to wildlife , and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle , i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos , then this is not the book for them otherwise , i would recommend it
i saw this book at a friend 's shortly after seeing the movie i asked her if i could borrow it she said i would n't want to she 'd been trying to read it for awhile , and did n't like it i decided to try anyway unfortunately , my friend was right this is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book i really liked the movie however , the book is too long and boring there are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story i ca n't believe i even finished it rent the movie do n't waste your time on the book
while this is a well researched and thought provoking piece of literature , i do have some critical comments to make
there are two things which tickle me about this book one is the sample zack 's report at the back which has a strong buy 1 rating on a 3 return on equity stock the other is the section on practical use of the system it , of course , is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 3 months and do n't forget about growth investors and value investors either this section is so short as to be laughable also notice that in the 2002 a list there were 216 stocks most are going to have to buy a subset but what subset \? no info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class perhaps an mvo addict or a monte carlo hack would have the answer
i zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that the main character just goes on a big , boring sight seeing tour it reminded me of that show on the travel channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design there is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it 's very short lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings i 've ever read the book just stops not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel
this book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms , bubbles , and busts
this is truly a disappointing book it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels \( 1 \) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl \( the young female protagonist in the hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality \) , \( 2 \) devoted , super powered canine companions , \( 3 \) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped out rvs , and \( 4 \) evil bioethicists
mcknight 's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate , but disturbingly overstated in this book
from reading danielle steel here 's the book three bachelors meet three women they all break up , they all end up happily ever after boring , not one single exciting thing about this book i was happy when my lunch break ended so i could go back to work and stop reading
while this book contains a ton of data , do n't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade if you look up french toast , for example , it only gives information on name brand items much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products i suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping , or use it before eating out , it would be helpful but if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items , you are out of luck with this book
while entertaining , i found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money while probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed i also found the timeline hard to believe maybe because i have lived in the area and understand the distances \( and traffic \) travelled in short periods of time i am a big elizabeth lowell fan \( as well as ann maxwell \) but this was not one of her better books
i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature some of the pages were blank , having not even been printed i figure the book was a total loss of money spent
gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics in fact i did n't like science and i had no mathematical aptitude
my first grisham novel , and it reminded me of why i seldom read fiction the plot has numerous barely believable twists , the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist 's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility said lawyer then drives from memphis to new orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid 's mere suggestion absurd ! no attorney in his her right mind would do such a thing !
i was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of chicago i had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting , but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names the plot is trite as are most of the characters characters change their stripes at the drop of a hat the book has a certain fairy tale , and they lived happily ever after quality that i found really disconcerting i would have been more satisfied if dean \( the main character \) had turned out to be an ax murderer ! just kidding of course or am i \? if you can pick this book up used for a couple of bucks , okay but do n't you pay a penny more
i ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that i would learn something about familiars in the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about ms little had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an owl \? had she entertained a hyrax or a feral cat as a house guest \? had she ever had a pet bat living behind a picture in the living room \? was she acquainted with the properties of henbane and twylight sleep and did she number hecate among her close friends \? the kindest thing , i thought was to suggest that ms little knew as much about familiars as i know about conveyancing or futures trading , and let it go at that
now that hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation
i am a teacher at an inner city school that struggles with the same issues presented by kozol that said , this is the fourth of kozol 's works that i have read , and i came away just as disappointed with the shame of the nation as i did with the rest of them i am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education he acts like we do n't already know he acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it , why does n't he use his experience and know it all knowledge to offer real , concrete and practical solutions \? kozol is a classic monday morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing but he does n't get his hands dirty anymore if he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is , the least he could do is offer some solutions i 've made four mistakes i will not make a fifth i have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach , and i ca n't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious
what a disastrously bad and unfunny novel the self involved main character is pathetic and whiny , the plot is see through and cliched , and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog
prof gardner 's book is disappointing he tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first also , his language is inflated , and lacking in philosopical specificity for example , he believes in building up the inner world of mental representations unexplained term yet insists on performances of understanding another unexplained term
becoming a master manager , the textbook currently used in my introduction to management class , does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management the book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager , and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role while i appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject , i do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow the reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency , and while meant well , they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper furthermore , becoming a master manager stresses models and theories of management that i find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management , which are not adequately presented in the textbook some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth , but in a more advanced level of business management and while becoming a master manager is the official textbook for my management class , i have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information , and only the eve of a test do i bother to look over becoming a master manager , i do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all
i'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with however , my public library has a limited selection of audio books , so i take what i can get i am a voracious reader , and i listen to audios to get more reading in , as you can listen and do other things i much prefer the lillian jackson braun cat books , at least there is some humor , and i like the mystery part of these books better than deaver 's sorry to all the deaver fan 's out there i have enjoyed a few of his books , but i get tired of the same ole same ole
i bought this book because it was listed with ellen miller 's like being killed , a brilliant and complex book about a woman 's love affair with heroin , her best friend susie , and her best friend 's duplicitous hiv positive boyfriend the protagonist herself was brilliant and complex so naturally , i expected the same thing out of swimming sweet arrow man , was i disappointed this was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman 's masochistic sex life , pathetic obsession with brutal men , and pathetic quest for attention her entire life is a meta existence rather than desiring , she desires to be desired rather than enjoying , she enjoys being enjoyed the male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who did n't exhibit the most common stereotypes in her world , all men are sensation craving brutes , and all women are attention craving doormats the men want drugs , fun , and sex , and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing not the drugs , not the sex , just being a victim due to the attention it provides this book made me really miserable to be perceived as part of this gender
i have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more the language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words these books can cause you embaesment , since i read where ever i have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it please we would all like to see more of these
on the plus side , this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises i was very excited at first , but unfortunately none of the exercises , massages , meditations , etc i tried seemed to help any of my health problems , even after a month the book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury , yet leaves me crying in disappointment i will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile , but i do n't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point
this is a nice enough board book , but be advised that it is not the full version of dr seuss' book ! they 've left out several \( charming ! \) pages of text and illustrations for the board book what a disappointment to loyal fans , and how unfair to the newest generation of fans to be
for decades , many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students to the fury of feminists to read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating
this book was suggested reading as if the great secret to personal freedom was going to be revealed it spoke of a self centered mindset that seemed to suggest that i was to live my life how i wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me a very simplistic and selfish point of view
i read a good short story by franzen in the new yorker a couple years ago , but this book is lame , lame , lame the essays contain little to no humor or insight they are just lengthy , boring opinions on various subjects imagine if you can a duller , less relavant andy rooney if i wanted to read some loser 's uninspired musings , i would get on the internet and start reading weblogs i hereby declare this book unreadable
sorry for the sarcastic title i 've read most of this book i'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter
this is my 3rd mcdermid novel , i previously read 'mermaids singing' and 'wire in the blood ' mcdermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel i see dangerous repetitions in character types which , if repeated in the next tony hill carol jordan book will make that one my last purchase generally mcdermid paints female police officers as brighter , more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts , as well as more often homosexual the men , with the exception of leading man tony hill , are mostly all egotistical , back stabbing , power hungry morons of the lowest order , while hill is rendered impotent a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber the slow mating dance between hill and jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff and in this book , the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as dr hill the emotional connection between hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here , making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought and the real villain not the serial killer but a drug pushing illegal immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer the climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger i was extremely disappointed with this book
was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free
while this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others , in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers do n't exist i 'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality , but just how far can we take this kind of analysis \? the author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same sex parent , he can determine the birth order of your ideal match my father was 3rd and i was 2nd , thus i should pair with a 4th born anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo science there are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions not every nth born is the same , and no relationship between nth and mth borns can be analysed this way as with astrology , the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong sign who 's to say i wo n't get along with a 2nd born \? rather than relying on voodoo like this , we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals
i was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real life situations i felt most of the book talked about how to parent , i e cosleeping , wearing baby , etc , but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation what do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when i pick him up \? i do n't want to spank , but a 24 month old just does n't take to a talk or timeout like dr sears says he should the sears birth book was amazing , i recommend it to anyone , but this book did not help me answer my questions
i'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely there evidence even trying very hard to be generous \( hey , i'm a christian and i think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true \) , i think i could poke a hole in every page and that 's after perhaps 12 months of formal mandarin study and a similar amount of cantonese
of paradise and power by robert kagan
i suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda that being said , in this book , mr dilorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts \( or at least with his conclusions \)
yuk ! ! ! worst book i 've ever read i read alot and with alot of variety this book stinks \( too farfetched , retched , disgusting and plain weird \)
the book is brilliant , no question about it his stories are great , his humor dry and culturally insightful the problem is that , like all audio books , the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience and in this case , unfortunately , the voice of the author fails the material
dr gray must be a wonderful lover as a woman i read his hints and suggestions for a man 's love making technique and marvel at his insight i truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom however there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover by maintaining a position of gallant ladies first mentality he , in truth , is demeaning the power of women 's sexuality
my 60s something father gave me this book i am a 45 year old middle class man with a 6 year old son using my wife 's account i do n't understand for whom this book is written it is full of painfully obvious advice such as do n't play with your food or do not throw golf clubs in anger anyone raised in america \( presuming that is the author 's intended audience \) who does n't already understand these things and take them to heart is n't going to be interested in reading about them in a book , if they can even read chapter 15 deals with staring and differences where the author admonishes do not repeat racist , sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence if you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this if you are , this book is n't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it i found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet if the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated , dream on ! i think the author has a professor henry higgins jones i am also concerned about my father 's opinion of me , i mean do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store duh
the publishers should be sued maybe we should get a class action together
i concur with another reviewer get luigi gambero 's mary and the fathers of the church , and , i might add , his follow up work , mary in the middle ages read these two books alongside truly our sister , then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic , historically contiguous development of the church 's marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the church has ever produced including bridget of sweden , or johnson 's glib , 21st century , feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment
i had high hopes when i picked up this book because styron is a terrific writer and i was interested in the subject by the time i was done i nearly threw it across the room admittedly , depression makes for a tough topic , but that 's not good enough
as someone very interested in urban exploration \( especially in the subways \) i wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it after reading many of these amazon reviews though , i opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my bronx library instead thank goodness as i only wasted valuable time , and not any money
sue grafton has written many good books but this one is weak , weak , weak try 'a is for alibi' or 'j is for judgement' they show off grafton 's writing talents much better
not that i do n't like shakespeare 's works , but his tragedies are terrible , especially this one i ca n't understand the language real well , so i have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it 'll be easier to understand i just ca n't understand this love tragedy at all ! here are some things that confuse me
i wanted to cry when i put this book down because i miss the danielle steele that wrote 'thurston house' , 'family circle' and others for years now i have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers i really feel like her heart just is n't in it anymore she has become very idiosyncratic and predictable every book has her main character 'being honest ' i keep reading because i am a loyal danielle steele fan and i write this in hopes she 'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it \( like she once did \) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works this book was just awful
i received this book as a gift i was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as bob novak and sean hannity have n't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book \? no and with good reason it 's not a history book , it 's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk the faithful out of their hard earned dollars
yet another offering from the kinkade art product assembly line pass on this read real books and buy real art instead
this is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you do n't have faith in the supernatural , you have no reason for hope
as a certified information systems security professional , i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here , and i'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it
like many others in my book group , i had been looking forward to finally reading something by pamuk and like most of my book group , i was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him originally published in turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one faruk darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive he then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't this should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes even more so if the reader knows that darvinoglu is the protagonist of pamuk 's earlier book the house of silence such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of calvino , borges , and their ilk
sorry , but i found this book a total waste of time i never did like the main character i found her boring ! i laughed out loud when i read another reviewer say that this person escaped her life to be a secretary \? good point ! it was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really and to continue this new life without really taking time to search her soul instead she befriends even more boring people than herself as far as the ending of the book goes i could n't have cared less what happened to her anyway ! after reading it \( book on tape \) i felt i had totally wasted my time what a disappointment
the author comes off as a whining , unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment further apalled by the church founder 's belief , in that it \( the worlwide church of god \) was god 's true church through the ages , right on up to the present 'end time' feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert w armstrong , the church 's actual teachings , and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult' and further damning its pastor general as a heretic , despite the church 's humanitarian works , publishing , colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of h w armstrong since armstrong 's death in 1986 , feazell and his cohort joseph tkach jr seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days , sabbaths , ten commandments \( which , in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions' \) and general lifestyle of this 7th day church of god denomination mr feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership , as over 100 , 000 members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states and continuing the legacy and apostolic , traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert w armstrong in 1927
this is yet another book where anyone who passed a high school bio class will know is crap he seems to have found a devoted crew of morons who believe that he really can cure all if you ever go to one of their conventions , you 'll know that its amway for stupid soccer moms with allergic kids
john katzenbach is an accomplished author and i had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels \( the analyst \) , so i was surprised at how bad the shadow man was the premise of the plot is that four very old jewish people , survivors of the holecaust , believe they have seen the shadow man the shadow man was a jew who joined forces with the nazis to find jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps these four old people feared the shadow man more than anything when one of them is killed , a retired police detective named simon winter looks into who the shadow man is meanwhile , the miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect
this book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998 ! ! ! totally out of date ! useless ! ! wondering why it is still for sale the author , contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked , simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one outrageaous ! spread the word and if you own the book , get your money back
i have been a huge fan of the anna pigeon mysteries the hard truth about hard truth is skip it it is a very unpleasant experience
jeremy narby 's the cosmic serpent dna and the origins of knowledge , started out decently enough with narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the amazon basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding dna and serpent myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of intelligent design and makes an all out attack on darwinian evolution and science itself
she wastes the first chapters , and my time , going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who does n't deserve to be hired would use it adds to the drama and despair i suppose , but it comes off as contrived , and as an attempt to pander to her extremist pessimist reading coterie
i fail to understand all of the hoopla about susan sontag while i have only read a limited selection of her work , in these essays , against interpretation being the ultimate example , sontag emerges as a simple minded , arrogant ignoramus in her utterly unreasoned invective , sontag ignores \( or is just unable to understand \) two critical facts first , some works of art and theory are difficult to understand \( in varying degrees \) without the help of interpretation sontag 's flawed analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached new and unheard of misguided heights second , sontag ignores the fact that works of art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language this could n't possibly be clearer than in poetry weinberger 's excellent nineteen ways of looking at wang wei , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference what was she thinking \? the only good aspect of the essay \( and why i give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero \) is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy sontag 's writing
i stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck , all those millions reading gray 's franchise ca n't be wrong plus , i 've seen gray on larry king once , and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy this book , though , promising in its intro to be sexy , touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves now , i am not above accepting bedroom advice where it 's warranted \( for instance , it is thanks to dr gray that i finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we 'd just went to see \) but gray 's generalizations , dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife bonnie were mostly unhelpful , and i suspect that the passages i found funny were involuntarily so
congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades
i have never read one of johansen 's books and after reading this one , i'm not likely to read another i usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but i just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche filled writing exclamations such as dear heaven and lord were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone \( it would suit my southern grandma , however \) as another reviewer said , the big mystery of why daisy would n't leave geneva was n't particularly mysterious if she really wanted jason to leave she could have just told him character development was lacking and i just did n't care that much about them i would have liked to hear more about cynthia and her antics i did finish the book because i was curious to know what happened , but i could n't wait for it to be over sorry , but this was not my cup of tea
and dump it great advice given in a previous review
the author has her narrator \( cinnamon \) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett , in a game of wish fulfillment one upmanship even though she 's calling the shots , as it 's her book , scarlett still comes out miles ahead perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society , but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism even if misplaced just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies , such as ivanhoe presents the story may have been one sided , but it 's the side mm chose to tell , and there 's kernel of truth in the myth of the old south , as in all myths
i found this book extremely verbose and unorganized it would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student but it 's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class the authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student not recommended
the author makes a good case for index mutual funds but there are
for someone who spends his career attacking politically motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science stephen jay gould is a paleontologist evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it

middle aged gracie is a typical hollywood wife , right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe when her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage , gracie finds herself without love , without friends , and most importantly , without status \( but at least she 's still got the money ! \)
i rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it , but i could n't take any more of look homeward , angel after part i \( about 1 3 of the way through \) it was long , rambling , and most of the passages did not add anything to the story , not even in the way of atmosphere i do not recommend this book
as the reviewer from jackhorn , ky stated , this book lacks original research if you read the section on the house church movement and then go to the website for the homechurch homepage , you will see that mr wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his research for the many quotes he used from the website , not once were any of the authors contacted by mr wolfe in order to do any original research if he had done so , he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book
bought book flipped through for 5 minutes , found good use starting a woodfire all the info contained can be had for free on the internet if youve been trading more then 2 days you already know more then the scope of this boo
as a professional , certified chef and baker , i am also an avid baking and cookbook collector after seeing that this book won and the james beard and the 'iacp cookbook of the year' awards both prominently displayed on the cover of this book and after reading the 'too good to be true' reviews on amazon some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if peter reinhart is the jesus christ of bread i finally decided to buy this expensive book
this has been a story of an american soldier whose involvement in the making of the world 's greatest dictionary was singular , astonishing , memorable and laudable and yet at the same time wretchedly sad prologue well , that certainly could have been the story but what it was was a history of the dictionary \( as in the history of the horse \) with w c minor 's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so winchester , the author of several other books i 'll avoid , also seems to suffer from the common malady or unwillingness of not knowing how to end a book so the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into the history of insanity dimentia alzeihmer 's , whatever you want to call what minor suffered whereas i should have shed a tear when the main character assuming it was n't a dictionary was laid to rest at age 85 , i was fairly glad to see him go
as a romantic comedy , star wars is a failure as a science fiction film , the annie hall is a complete disappointment whatever other merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking which brings me to the rough guide to cult movies as a reference book , it is highly suspect what 's notable is that annie hall fails as sci fi because it does n't try to be that genre the rough guide fails at the very category it aspires to which is too bad , because it is often an interesting read
another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation if you dig that sort of thing there are tons out on the market unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers like one would get when reading a book on the occult people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it it is a living when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism or in this case the secret agenda before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad
all i can say is pass me some aspirin this is a dozy of a bad novel as it says on the dust jacket , a supreme court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit at the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for
i must say that after reading this book , i am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between japan and the us
the book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading if you do n't know anything about database marketing , then you will get something out of this book if you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis , loyalty programs and relationship marketing , there is nothing new here in fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is the loyalty effect by reichenheld or customer connections by wayland and cole the subtitle mentions the dot com world , but the book has little to say about the internet the book really does not cover crms \( as oppsed to database marketing \) in that it fails describe how crm systems work and what database , modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them
oh my god ! ! ! ! there is another patricia kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind i thought one patricia was enough but after reading this book , i am faced with the frightening realization that there are two of them !
a rather toothless attempt at rewriting strunk and white , or chicago into fun reference books should n't waste this much space on casual conversation get to the point get elements of style , elements of grammar , and chicago rather than this handbook
this textbook is more useful for the flashy \( and admittedly very good \) teacher 's ancillaries but this review is not for the ancillaries it is for the text itself
the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again i was disappointed , soon after , when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts , with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle and then even that was disappointing i mean graceland for a first date \? i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights , and logan and nate from that same book none of them can talk in complete sentences and stella , who comes across as this loving mother , who puts her kids before anything else , works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she is n't there to oversee everything , even though the place has been successful for years there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband , she just does it unless , of course , it was in the last 50 pages which i did n't bother to read because i just could n't torture myself any longer and i'm a big fan of roberts i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out
this book has taken photo after photo straight out of the ikea catalogue ! obviously , the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to ikea 's design and storage ideas this book actually put me in a bad mood listen up folks , the ikea catalogue is free do yourselves a favour and pick one up , because none of these so called organization books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local ikea store these authors should be fired shame on both of them
not insightful , not even humorous i am willing to admit that maybe i just do n't get his writing style , whatever that might be i hope mr rakoff gets into a new line of wor
ridiculous , convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring
when i reviewed the street lawyer recently , i mentioned that i 've never put down a grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props for that book , certainly for this one , nope i read four chapters , 41 of its 391 pages , and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot i hope he just had an off day or something , and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable
i'm thankful that i was able to get this book at the library and did n't spend 15 00 buying it i own the blue day book by the same author and i think it 's fantastic and it cheers me up right away he should have stopped with that book it claims to be a witty , thought provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who 's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way the only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures it did have one thought that i really liked some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge if that 's true , then why do smart people dress so badly \?
i liked most of jo beverly 's books in fact , she is one of my favorite romance writers that 's why it 's hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived the premise saving an opium addict is good one could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers but no it 's all pretty smooth the passion is tepid and not much else happens a series of rogues from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story and the conversations are so boring that i simply had to skip them i guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core beverly fans

the package the book came in was smashed the book appeared as if it had been used it took over 2 weeks for it to arrive i would n't order any books from amazon agai
spend your money elsewhere for someone who supposedly lives in the vicinity of yellowstone he knows and sees little to anyone who steps outside of the sealed up world of their car and even casually looks , the senses are all brought to life with sights sounds , smells , temperatures , textures and colors cahill does not inform he is not even a very good writer , for if he were , he 'd do the same thing i did , huck the book into the trash go to yellowstone yourself and hang out the windows of your car and even that simple pleasure will tell you how inadequate this book really is
got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad pages are falling out
i recently read i , k , and l in succession compared to innocent and killer , i found lawless to be slow paced \( even though this edition finds kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country \) and the plot twists less surprising with others i 've read in the series , i am usually hooked relatively early in the story line i was 1 3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing \( kinsey has little contact with immediate family , ergo she substitutes others in her life henry , rosie , pitt family , the criminal elements in this book as her family \) i also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in l could be so dim witted on one page , and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next anyway , there are others in this series i would recommend more highly \( m being one of them \)
i had to read this book for an intro to geology course , and although i find geology to be fascinating , i had a very difficult time following this book the author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious although i understood what mcphee was talking about most of the time , i think it would have made a better film documentary than a book the author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all it would be more readable if written as a field journal because i could not even figure out when one day turned into another but the book did a decent job of presenting the bigger picture
samantha seems a lot like becky a young woman whose life is very out of balance and does n't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions instead of staying at the firm and working out her mistake , she runs away this is just like becky hiding her bills and then she gets a totally implausible job , because she ca n't tell the truth again like becky samantha does n't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to
this is the first book i 've ever returned while a lot of what she does is admirable and does work \( the you form instead of lord he works very well \) , two things make it unusable constant use of beloved for the word god or lord becomes irritating very quickly , and she subjectively pops out the word enemies wherever it appears and puts in fears i would n't dare tell someone with aids or a refuge or whomever that their only enemy is their own fears , and even for others such overpersonalization does n't work the classic 137th psalm was unrecognizable where did the dolphins come from
bad paper , old advice just plain awful and a waste of money
of the thousands of books i 've read in my life , and the hundreds i 've actually purchased from amazon com , this is the first time i 've felt strongly enough about a book to write any sort of review
just not my cup of tea well written but as i said not my cup of tea i will not purchase the others in the series
three things make me better than sean hannity
i bought this book 2 years ago almost to the day i have the receipt stuck in the book i can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then i just ca n't stomach anymore and i put it down for 2 more years maybe this is a piece of art something to be treasured and something that should change your life but pleasure reading should n't be this painful i wish the store would take it back but i think i 've probably had it for too long
the first book of auster 's new york trilogy was originally published in 1985 , and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel i 've never read the original \( or any of the other parts of the trilogy \) , so i ca n't comment on karasik and mazzicchelli 's adaptation however , i can say that since i'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature \( those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for auster 's story \) , this really did n't do anything for me at all the story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , great i do not it is dressed up \( at least initially \) in the mystery genre , but that 's just window dressing \( there 's a long legacy , especially in france , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings \( for example alain robbe grillet 's two books the erasers and the voyeur , or the films of jean pierre melville \)
paul auster 's city of glass is perhaps the worst read i 've experienced the story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated i kid you not the best part of this novel is the end i read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid however , i was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams to all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical , existential tour de force , i beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ i believe the author had no such thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining , dry dry dry piece of fiction with one or two not so clever plot devices , gather such literary praise like a rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of wonderful symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , intepret and dwell in that depth coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life , well , then , good for you but in reality , the person that made that rorschach for you is auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you all bought it hook line and sinker this novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us little on the way and still receive praise , despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work , in that it plain and simply sucks
this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money page 364 principles of long term investing chapter 8 shows that among the sandp 500 index returns , large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks now look at chapter 8 of the 10 largest corporations , only 2 \( exxon mobile and citigroup \) are value stocks duuhhh now i know what to do i have a choice of two stocks if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket , buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart if you know little , it wo n't add to your knowledge at all
i bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects , and given most other people 's ratings , i decided to give it a try however , upon opening the book my first thought was , these all look like high school yearbook photos , which is exacltly what they are it seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market his main concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a saleable picture , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with final say over the pictures a better title for this book would have been , how to take high school senior pictures
ehrman 's work is not for a person of faith it does not take faith into consideration it is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available most forged and falsified and none which can be validated i read it as an immediate follow up to his work lost scriptures books that did not make it into the new testament i was warned by my minister who is also a bible scholar and has two ph d 's and my minister was correct in lost christianities , ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the new testament by implying that many new testament books may be false , forged , translated incorrectly , altered to serve a purpose , etc ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the new testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the new testament ehrman 's lost christianities starts out strong , but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader if for nothing else , it is an attempt to test your faith , but in the end your faith will be strenghtened if you have faith the book leads one to believe that the author is as much a bible critic as he claims to be a scholar he does present all sides of the new testament story and it is interesting how the new testament was formed however , the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does to save you the time and money , simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the new testament and how came to be ehrman and other bible critics \( ie , the devinci code \) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the new testament story save your money and give it to your church instead
i'm a conan doyle fan and found the alienist to be a pretty good read , so i made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it the dialogue is flat , the plot uncompelling and carr relies on the near endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement ! ! ! into this tale , which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because i could n't bear to read the mangled sentences this book has no climax just , thankfully , an ending spend your money on something worth reading
i had read all about fsm before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece
nansook hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to hyojin moon , but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the moon family eyewitnesses tell of nansook visiting the moon household and knowing full well of hyojin 's excesses in advance of her marriage the hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the moon family , and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first moon daughter , they pushed nansook to marry a moon son though i do n't know all the motives , the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that ms hong has not been honest about it is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of rev moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect , given her own deceit
normally , i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started not the case with s i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand the main character violet was too much of a stereotype boobs , red hair , just a boozing slut over all i did n't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her the ending was n't clear either i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades most of the characters just were n't that interesting overall
so , being a fan of all forms of literature , more specifically challenging faulkner , pretentious d h lawrence and original kafka works , i was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what 's considered pynchon 's most imporant work
this smugly edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny
i thought this book was going to be a great legal thriller , but little did i know that it would turn out to be the worst book i have ever read i expected a lot more out of scott turow , who wrote one l , which i loved , but this book was plan boring the begining started out slow and it never picked up from there ! the worst legal thriller , ever
from about the second page of this book , i was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it the characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another add to that the stereotypical characters \( the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys , the women are all large assed or fat with the exception of ella \) and the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb , not to mention kind of repulsive \( i like a good sex scene as much as the next person , but tuck 's descriptions are completely banal \)
i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me nothing ever happens there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story
i agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long genetic algorithms are a great programming tool , and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately , but this book had a lot of redundant information
i agree completely with the becksted review \( i also noted that it was helpful , but i meant it would have been helpful had i read it before i bought the cd \)
yes , it was intended as a fun read \( literature of the absurd \? \) and it did evoke several chuckles , especially at the first but as literature \( read into that word what you will \) it 's an abysmal failure crammed with so many jokes , puns , outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action , one 's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices it 's a case where you ca n't see the forest for all the intervening trees
i 've read most of the books written by greg iles i liked them all except dead sleep , which by the way was much better than this one !
this book tries to convince non christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy , without addressing fundamental objections
this book is poorly written although it is one of the most update to date versions out ther , it seems muddled and repetitive i was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors clearly little time was spent editing this book i'm not sure how it got to be a new york times bestseller , outside of the fact that it is related to harry potter i 'd advise going with a different biography
by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit pollard 's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might and while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion , \( i e swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century \) pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of christian virtue this is basically saying christians have lost a culture war without explaining why
hunt this book down
personally i found this book to be little more than a gre verbal refresher course sure , it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing i think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of , well , then , does this really matter \? in my opinion i feel this is what the author has done i was really disappointed in this book
this book may be as well called the chicken soup for the writing it down souls the author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories however , if you are a self help reader like me who is used to david allen 's getting things done , you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can
the book claims to help you
to anyone who has or is planning on reading this book , consider this this book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone 's guilty conscience ease in thinking that your own will is god 's own will \( quoted from walsh 's books \) if you will it , then god wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom , right \? will is a precursor to action if there is no such this an a 'right' or 'wrong' will , then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right' or 'wrong' action if someone else 's actions hurt you , you feel that action is wrong but the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way , right \? it was his will , therefore he was justified and right and god 's right there to back him up the victim is suffering where is his god when he needs him \? was the victim correct in believing the action wrong \? was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right \? in this book , god says that we have the authority to decide what is right or wrong the action is both right and wrong , right \? wrong
my almost 6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi pronged approach , including things like supplements , a gfcf diet , and ot pt speech after a year on the gfcf diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors , we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies
do n't buy this book , no substance only good for sale
you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume ! does n't this hurt the bottom line at hagee ministries \? what , has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up \? it reminds me of when the band , kiss \( aka kings in satan 's service \) re packaged their first three albums as the originals at least in that case you had an extra track of rock and roll all nite , assuming you already had the album dressed to kill on the other hand , maybe hagee ministries was using the kiss model , assuming that it would n't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy , compact volume of fear
i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath or east of eden instead i have focused on of mice and men and his lesser known works , such as to a god unknown and , my personal favorite , pastures of heaven i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular
this is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity , and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader 's attention the result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying
when i traveled in japan with a friend , this was the book we brought with us within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in tokyo looking for a better one there are some things this guide does quite well it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country , and the advice to get a jr pass was invaluable
this is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s a time when a yarn was n't an archaic term does it give some helpful hints \? sure , there 's the obvious ones like show do n't tell and all characters have free will but fiction has changed a lot since henry james \( thankfully \) , and this book might be better left unread plus , i do n't buy the only people who are n't well read do n't like it argument i 've read nearly all the books mentioned and i still wish i never bought this book
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia is this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note at the end of the book we read sep 10 , 1990 nov 10 , 1993 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted
while easy enough to read , if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover , i would n't know the difference
maybe it was me , but i kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and i had to put it down it was almost aggravating
steer clear of this one criticizing others for lack of original thought or a consistent viewpoint , while virtually copying their cover \( not to mention riding the wave of their unique concept \) illustrates the weak and timid position assumed by this author please achieve your own significance , not bashing others popular and widely accepted readership as christians , we are obviously aware of varying theories on end times to even slightly indicate we are not aware indicates the authors pompous platform so sad his approach could n't be based on his own original work
i was very excited about receiving this book , by the way big upps to lupo997 for getting my book to me in a timely fashion after reviewing the book further i realized it was like touched by an angel , and i do n't like that show at all , but i decided to read it anyway cause it looked good that was a mistake , the character 's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable in the first story rainmaker the professor was sooo in love with hailey he did n't care about getting killed or putting his own child 's life in danger come on now he would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows i did n't even read the second story , maybe i 'll come back to that the third story was totally ridiculous as well paris is so sick of russell he does n't have a job , money and no ambition , yet she stays with him he cheats on her , she has the broads up in her house and sells them mary kay ! ! yet she stays with him he has given her an std ! ! ! she stays with him ! ! ! she does n't even like making love to him during all of this nonsense her fi one boss is pushing up on her , and she resists she wo n't cheat on her man what ! ! ! ! if you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you for everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction do not get this book !
bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny boy were we disappointed as was mentioned in another post the book is nothing more than a glorified outline , and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk , which forms by the way are in pdf form and are not even fillable
i found this book to be full of silly metaphors \( as if that 's the only way we could relate to dr twerski \) it just did n't get me the information i needed perhaps others would find it motivational
this books seems interesting until you learn \( within a few pages \) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct
i agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told there is no excitement in describing the stages they are just wrapped up all of a sudden
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
trash sells and this is the definition of trash unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write
i have read all of the scarpetta novels through the last precinct , and i have never wanted hours of my life back as i did when i finished the last precinct
how some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me first of all , i 'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first ! secondly , if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it ! this book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section horrible ! so basically , this introduction to electronics does n't do a lot of introducing you to anything ! i'm on transistors right now , and i 've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the internet , and guess what \? it 's using schematics i do n't understand , and yet again i'm going to have to do more looking on the net this book is not worth it do n't buy it ! just please , for your own sake , find another one also , half the book is dedicated to projects that is , actually building electronic circuits ! why did n't the author just entitle this , how to build electronic devices , then \? it 's beyond me ! as far as explaining things are concerned , the book does very little , and assume you know more than you do unfortunately i'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook , because this one is just horrible i was really wanting to learn something from this book , but it 's just not happening for every chapter i 've read on this book i 've had to do research on the net , and i'm sick of it i'm on pg 154 , and i'm closing it do not buy this book ! i 've already found a better book on amazon com \( just buy reading the table of contents ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \) and i'm going to get it !
this book is by far the worst proofed book i 've ever read in my life i ca n't believe i'm writing this as a review , because i can normally overlook a few typos however , the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read i ca n't believe i paid money for it
i do n't own this book nor have i read it , but if that first sentence is any indication of the quality of writing , i wo n't ever it is not a sentence one would think you would save your non sentences for someplace else in a book , not start off with one , giving your readers the impression that you are all hat and no cattle before you even make your points
this book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society we can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to while wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate , his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling sorry for them
i am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review however , after reading botox diaries , i felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull , trite , and disjointed i love my chick lit books , but botox diaries is a disgrace to this genre the plot is weak and unrealistic \( even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords lite and fun books \) the plot is also disjointed , perhaps because two authors co wrote this book the characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull botox diaries is absolutely the worst book i have ever read
this is perhaps the most disappointing king book i have ever read \( and considering that i have read desperation and insomnia that is saying a lot \) the storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story i have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top the only thing i found interesting about king as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book
of all the textbooks i 've had , from elementary school through graduate school , this is easily the worst one i 've ever had , for any course
after reading the first book \( which was catastropha \) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series
have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening \? the kind of person that ca n't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered \? well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book you ca n't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or god no you need to relate to it and make it a part of you
to me this book was definately not one of the best in the series i admire the kristina , but this book was slow and dull it was practiacally all about the politics of sweden very dull
i'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with however , my public library has a limited selection of audio books , so i take what i can get i am a voracious reader , and i listen to audios to get more reading in , as you can listen and do other things i much prefer the lillian jackson braun cat books , at least there is some humor , and i like the mystery part of these books better than deaver 's sorry to all the deaver fan 's out there i have enjoyed a few of his books , but i get tired of the same ole same ole
i admit i was impressed by the table of contents of this book , and i admit i had no previous experience with the subject , but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me , this is just enough to be dissapointed there are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free although some formulas and templates looks very interesting \( that 's why 2 stars \) , maybe should you consider a help desk book instead
like most critics of objectivism , mr walker focuses his criticism on ayn rand 's frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded my disappointment in his book was immediate and i have to say it 's as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic i 've read his cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously i cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy this book was written for those of like mind to the author whatever mind they can be said to have
i would normally not read barbara taylor bradford but my boyfriends' mom gave it to me as part of a present , so i said what the heck , i 'll try it
this was n't such a bad novel , and i kind of enjoyed it not great , but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly however , the ending really killed it for me it 's too unnecessarily long once the major conflict is resolved , the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah i wish i 'd just put the book down after the rain because i would 've left with a feeling of at least entertainment but after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications , only pages of explanations , i just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book would 've been three stars if it 'd just known when to end
hi ,
timothy garton ash 's book the file was very provocative and interesting i thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in east berlin before unification and then was able to see his file afterwards however , i am a bit disillusioned the story interests me but garton ash really does n't say anything ! i am disappointed that he so poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state and yet he does not back it up the book is good under the premise of democracy good , communism bad it feels like he is just pooling for support and nobody knew the wall was going to fall when it did i know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism i'm wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event i am dissappointed maybe i just do n't know enough of garton ash but if this is the case , i should not have to feel the need to know his history before reading the book the book had some good points and kept me entertained but on the whole did n't do anything for me peace
petra of all places supernatural protection , persecution , on ad naseum the one drug on , and on , and on , and on
this is a very famous and a very influential book this was not the first time i checked the book out of the library but i now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than i did when i first became familiar with kramer 's book what i found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me this is not a book supported by research it is a book of stories the stories , one after the other , are about kramer 's patients \( kramer is a psychiatrist \) and how taking prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight consider these four examples
i work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books this one caught my eye and i was expecting something wonderful i found the story to be hopeless and defeating how sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat i'm no censor , but two thumbs way down also , if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss , try cynthia rylant 's , cat heaven
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series years later i read s is for silence and was hooked i started to read the series backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine \( and forgiven ms grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 frame \) however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly \( and unbelievable \) dangerous situation , to name a few the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics but even with these issues , i did finish the book grafton at her low point is still a good read
the first few chapters have built the anticipation for a good strategy to learn , however , there were no formulas , nothing to learn
interesting , well documented , with marvelous illustrations definitely a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters it is a pity that the collection does not include stories from one thousand and one nights otherwise it will be perfect and complete
it certainly sounded exciting unfortunately , it 's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you 've already thought of a hundred times that 's not to say that the ideas are n't important i was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks on the bright side , the book wo n't become dated for quite some time
the author had all the elements for a good mystery suspense except for one thing , the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery
flynn offers up a fast paced , if unbelievable story unfortunately , character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters , like rapp , with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles , have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile , flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters , flynn consistently goes for the cheap , partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking
i felt as if this book was way below my reading leve
i'm really a great fan of douglas coupland , which is perhaps much of the reason i found this book so disappointing i hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new microserfs , since it totally lacks the insight , wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original about the only thing it has in common with microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry
then you 'll probably like this story
this book is atrocious it is the worst book i have read in the last decade a 10 year old could have done better the plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses , the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage the only plus was that i got it out of the library and did n't pay for it
why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book \? honestly , what has this author contributed to the world with this book \? was it the characters \? no , they 've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years \( i e cocky and handsome fbi agent , beautiful but dangerous killer with a past , take no sh t fbi boss , etc \) was it the deep insight into the characters themselves \? a laugh out loud , no ! there was nothing coming close to character development was there some new and clever writing style \? unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary \( i call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel \) how about the plot \? was that something worth my time \? not unless you have n't ever watched suspence movie in your life
my friend 's and i will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good my friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along , but since i have a dog , i thought it would be interesting , but it was n't , so i had the honor of throwing it out myself
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point \( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies \) my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter \( and much better writing \) man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
ms reichs has lost the recipe , or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to cross bones although not nearly as bad as p cornwell 's last two or three misfires , reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here in this offering , temperance is out of character , out of both style and focus , and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice reichs has maintained in her many brennan novels having finally given up on cornwell , after many years , i 'll hang in there for one more temperance brennan dig everyone is entitled to one gong
\? millennials rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors william strauss and neil howe , focusing this time on the generation born after x
it certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge based workers are the future in american society it seems to me that drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize marx , which was a complete failure drucker did n't even fully analyze globalization in its entirety
mr o'nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing his skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people , events , etc , is downright frustrating and confuses the project unlike superior literary treatments \( see walter lord 's titanic \) , this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long , hot shower
this fourth installment of becky 's trying tribulations is the worst the qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment i do n't understand how kinsella 's editor did n't draw the line \( and the red pencil \) at the litany of shopping expeditions and her endless , excrutitating 'inner' reflections becky 's exploits are n't amusing anymore her purchases on her honeymoon are n't wacky they 're bewildering for a shopaholic with supposedly good taste , becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on ebay once home in england and oh yes , then she discovers a long lost sister that situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book and then bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by tarquin in his personal helicopter i am not making this up it 's all there in the book and none of it is even remotely entertaining and now god help us , becky is pregnant aarrgggh !
this is a revolutionary book it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology all of social interaction is a performance on a stage it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement the language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated there are some problems with clarity and structure the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me no sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book so if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start \( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction \)
robin williams used to tell a joke about his son , saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and i 'll write a book ' i 'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind peggy salinger 's memior about life with her father , but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea although there are some interesting revelations about salinger as a man , his daughter does n't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of jd salinger , they 're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday there 's a lot of blame thrown around here , and not a whole lot of admitting to one 's own mistakes although this is probably to be expected , it 's still frustrating , since margaret salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father 's good name , and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical \( complaining about your father 's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea \) i admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be , but this is not really a revelation , nor should it affect your feelings about his work i would n't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort
i was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian well , i was wrong it was long , tedious and nasty granted , chaplin was not perfect , but the author 's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening a better title for this book would be 'trash , what i think of charlie' joyce milton would do well writing for tabloids
many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable \( i happened to be 13 when i read it \) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault
i am a bright student and have a gpa of 3 86 this book is completely useless for class i reread the chapters and it simply does not make sense i found the internet to contain more useful information this book should not be used in any introduction to philosophy classes it is much too complex if you are attending classes at wiu , i would skip the purchase of this book and rely on the internet for your assignments
great book , of course , but for this edition oxford used a computer to justify the type on every other line you encounter three or four spaces where there should be only one it may not bother most readers , but i'm looking for another publisher 's edition
this should be retitled the leftist , israel hating , politically correct revisionist guide to the middle east that would be far more accurate for a textbook , the author freelances just a tad bit too much , a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise the author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the middle east and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way
if you 're going to write about the city that is paris , you 'd better be up to the task gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well , but this collection of essays generally falls flat for someone who resided in the city of light for 5 whole years , gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self absorption those who are interested in paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a new yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city i have zero interest in my toddler does paris stories and gopnik 's relentless insertion of his look how cute my kid is accounts should have been saved for a family re union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics
the book is n't good at all i'm sorry i loved i am legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies \( hell house included \) i was really excited to read this i have heard many complaints about the book from calling it soft porn to sick soft porn and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale sacrilege in a book called hell house is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary i doubt these were mathis' sexual fantasies in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying it is an effective way to convey horror to a reader similar to enacting horrible violence on children , or worse , babies in cinema \( try watching the hills have eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face \) mathis should not be condemned for content
no thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story
this book is more of the same rehashed , recycled , repurposed content from the authors much of this material is available in any basic marketing text in fact , this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding if you 've worked at any of the big agencies mccann , jwt , yandr , you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour all the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak the editorial reviews listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as cases in the book
a dirty job was my first christopher moore novel , and will probably be my last i was captivated by the story line as i read the dust jacket , but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting i thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest , and very little addressing the actual theme of the book although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book 's hero , i just was n't drawn in enough to care about him the action began in the final quarter of the book , and you had better suspend reality before reading it i actually could n't wait for the book to end so i could move on to something more interesting
i enjoyed andy kessler 's book about finance \( wall st meat \) but this one is just silly it seems to show the wisdom of the old writer 's saw about sticking with something you know about this book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day i could n't wait to get to the end so i could throw it out
the word atlas is misleading as there is alot of text accompanying the various maps some pages are nothing but text i expect an atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words the maps that are in the book are good , but numerous sections do not have one
wow what lies i never hear any kind of news channel favor the left never the media , especially fox news , has a right wing bias its 100 fact , proven beyond any reasonable doubt the republican right wing nut job wackos invented the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage , and its simply not true
the amazon description says vol 1 3 , boxed set , hardcover that is all true what they do n't tell you is that there are actually six volumes the box in which it comes is clearly marked , volumes 1 3 \( of six \) that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used if you have volumes 4 6 and you are looking to complete the set , this book is for you if you are looking for the complete set , look elsewhere
sadly , this thrilling sea yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today between the seafaring jargon which must have delighted boys of yore and the unfathomable dialects , it can take ages to puzzle out a page some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner we 're here , which has picked up over privileged harvey cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner , i could not grasp the point or moral of my husband has read all the patrick o'brian series , so i asked him to puzzle out a representative story , that of counahan the navigator , and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood , he said , honey , i see what you mean one can get the general gist , but it 's best to read through fast , then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense
i would not personally recommend this book to horror thriller fans i would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18 ! if you like soap operas , you may enjoy this book a lot if you are searching for the secrets of rose red or a good ghost story , this is not your book
the book 's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues this approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a lesbian led household especially a girl child if the child is a boy and or approachng 8 or 9 years old , the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked
if you want a very simple will or a very simple living will or power of attorney for health care , this program will work for you however , it offers only a very narrow range of options for personalizing the generic forms included in the package i disliked this program so much that i threw the whole package in the trash
tipler says many times as i have proved huh \? what the f is he talking about \? there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth he 's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book i 'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense , but i do n't think it should matter i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts , and tipler just does n't make any sense his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time the more books you read , the sooner you know when to stop reading , put the book down , and read a work of fiction instead , which can play with such ideas without boring you to death
i enjoy the hillerman navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed not so in this book i found the first half really boring and hard to get through the characters were not people you could care about , an important issue for me
as a piece of entertainment , this book falls flat way flat there is a story here , but mundane sub plots \( including the love story \) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book i found myself skipping pages lots of them to get to the point overall , very disappointing
amazingly tedious for a thriller reacher is a good character , believable in his expertise , but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence the book takes too long to tell everything \( and i mean everything \) it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought reacher has \( many repeated over and over \) i hope child fixed these flaws in later books
i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book , considering the title however , the actual project does n't make an appearence until the last chapter the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place
as i read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by mr cussler , the story was slow and the plot was transparent
does d s know any other law schools besides , harvard and yale for her characters to have attended i am so tired of her books this is it for me its the usual suspects for her rich and white quite boring i used to love her and would read anything from her , but those days are over maybe she should retire
the very first thing you read in this book is a mistake the prologue begins with a photo of german pows at the end of wwi the photo caption states that the german army at the end of wwi was unbroken and implies that germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership this is doubly misleading the german army was soundly defeated on western front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate in 1918 , germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by ludendorff and hindenberg the political leaders who lost will were the german high command defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious stab in the back myth used by the german military and right wing propagandists to undermine the weimar republic its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters
this book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms as a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure , i am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork i had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it the book gives some accupoints for specific problems , some of these are golden points able to stand alone in use , but others are not the book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence , or not also , it does't tell where the points are exactly there are really too many flaws to go into here acupressure is very complex , this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo
i bought this software hoping that it would help me to find required mathematical formulas faster at home on my powermac \( osx 1 , os9 2 \) i only see messed up windows furthermore , the formulas are unreadable , using an archaic font trying to save the day , i went to my linux machine at work reading your operating system , linux 2 2 19 7 0 1 , is not supported by this software it appears that the software is only suitable for some sun and sgi machines it only appears to run properly on a windows machine from an editor , who i remember , is one of the few persons finding errors in knuth 's tex system , i expected much better
the number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market \? one reason , apparently embraced by the goldstones , is that it is so easy to write a book ! all you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences they do n't have to be particularly interesting experiences you do n't have to do any research into your subject if you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing , if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took , if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers \( even if they are not interesting or witty \) , and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in , you can finish the book in a couple of weekends ! and readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done
what exactly is it that ms wearstler does \? this book is filled with glam pictures of recycled design ideas by billy haines , dorothy draper and billy baldwin , mostly of the hollywood regency style ms wearstler , whose home it is , appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look
fans of the abc tv show lost will probably be buying our mutual friend in droves after having seen desmond keeping it to be the last book i ever read since i did not have to buy it , having purchased a full set of dickens years ago , i immediately set out to read it
the title is a misrepresentation this is not a handbook for driving a porsche quickly or professionally i bought this book because in 2 months i am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a f1 circuit i have no circuit experience , and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country i live in since this is a rear engined car which i have little experience with i was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars there is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving porsches or rear engined cars the only reason i will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960 's and early 19970 's porsche racing pictures \( poor quality black and white though \) also to be fair there are some good racing stories he is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing a better title would be my porsche racing history if you want a book on fast driving i would highly recommend ross bentley 's speed secrets in place of this book
when i picked up this book i had high expectations , seeing that it had received good reviews it opened quite spectacularly as well , on a rather surreal note but as i read on , i could n't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent , rambling tale the book seemed like a sloppy , haphazard collection of incidents that did n't make much sense or assist character development the central character herself was unbelievable and i found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights it seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip , cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky some incidents were quite mirth provoking , however , that 's why i gave it two stars
this was another pinker book i could n't finish if he was a taxi driver he would take you from brooklyn to new york via san francisco sometimes even his asides have asides ! perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
while i very much enjoyed miss wearstler 's first book , i found domicilium decoratus to be borderline obnoxious rather than show great decorating , the book focused mainly on close up shots of objects in her house that took up the whole page in addition , i feel that as the viewer of the book i do not need to see fifteen entire pages of miss wearstler dressed in ball gowns pretending to be domestic
i am an avid reader , and i will finish a book no matter how difficult it is , or how boring it is , and i could n't finish this one it was so dry and i could n't connect with any of the characters i was really disappointed
i want to make a short comment here
the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case , when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is \? we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen , the characters are outrageous , most of the time improbable , and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid , not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it
this book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content , and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible what a bunch of baloney
an elf appearing to harry potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery the chamber of secrets , he said , had been opened and a monster is lurking harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster , challenge it and save students who have been petrified by the monster age group interest early teen i wanted to see what all the rave was about lots of action , not much morale
a writer for the irish echo said this book should have been titled the protocols of the elders of erin it was written around the time al smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist , anti catholic prejudices of upstate new york and america at that time while there really were gangs in that era , most of new york 's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like st vincent 's , fordham , st john 's , manhattan and manhattanville the vast majority of the city 's population including its immigrants did n't riot in 1863 in fact new york city 's 200 , 000 soldiers and sailors , more than half of whom were immigrants , won over 100 medals of honor during america 's civil war
i find it very difficult to get through half of this book i have put it down and picked it up more times than i care to mention it is a waste of time awful book

this is a very bad book it is poorly written , the characters are caricatures in misery , and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter , who suffers in silence after the devastating , and , to her , mysterious , death of her mother her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child 's behavior , which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response , rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break i could n't finish this it is drivel
i was looking forward to reading this book , first in a series sadly , i gave up on it about 100 pages in i felt there was so much mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all it just feels completely unemotional and without any sort of feeling there is nothing exciting about this book the heroine is naive , and not in a good way i hope the others in this series are better 1 5 stars
this book provides a good overview of blacks \( slave and free \) in new york it 's a very good reference \( encyclopedic \) book
i have received your new book against the human race , and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs , in reading your book , to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years , i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada , because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves voltaire \( 1755
in a world desperate for health solutions , the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters
i found stale recounting of very well known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics , with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors , and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface , i was n't expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg \( about technology in the economy of the 19th century \) i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the 1980s i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy
this book is simply horrible repetitive dialogue and situations characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes
ok , i ca n't deny it , this book was well written but what made me throw up is the age differance , i mean what the hell ! how can tana like someone who 's 30 years older than her \? that 's aweful ! this is what i really hate about dan 's books , she hooks someone who 's 20 with some1 who 's 35 i do n't find that interesting all i can say about full circle is that it 's good but so depressing it made me cry \( which proves that danielle is a good writer \) do n't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed
i have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration and i love books , so this is drastic ! spoilers ahead please do n't read on if you have n't read the book i managed to \( somehow \) get through the first book , 'wideacre' , which i disliked whilst i adore the rest of gregory 's novels , so this was hard for me and grit my teeth and tried to read this book , the sequel as i 'd bought it and it looked more promising it was 'marginally better' as one reader put it , than the first , but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed
chromosome 6 has a great premise what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs a sort of biological insurance policy \? how much would people pay for this service \? how far would they go to protect it \? what are the moral implications \?
well , if anything this was a decently written story , with good dialect and character detail however , this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there
after get shorty , e l might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again , with this single minded purpose focused , e l wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty and he was right again , it was bought and made into a movie again , but pathetically , a horrible one compared to get shorty the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e l indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind i simply failed to find there 's any interest in reading this going nowhere story it just like reading a double imaged e l personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie , with all the bore to death script , dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles , especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty' \? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose' \? and at every corner of los angeles , every table in any restaurant , almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer' \? and you have to ask yourself since when people would recognize a behind the screen movie producer , even a director in person \? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are \? yeah , maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly \? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show \? give me a break ! this book , from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no brainer , so shallow and so superficious ! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash in
gail 's writing is again wonderful in this in book , but i found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure i felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character 's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be i almost felt as if the writer was n't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic , yet hopeful story i can only compare this book to the samurai 's garden since i have n't read a third book by this author yet , and i loved the samari 's garden ! so i was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end i am not sorry that i read this book due to the fact that i enjoy the author 's style of writing
i wanted to like this book , but i found it disappointingly thin i would n't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as hopeless , but it 's certainly superficial postman seems to rely on secondary sources about enlightenment thought , rather than any deep reading of enlightenment texts the idea of building a bridge to the 18th century seems more like a marketing device , a fresh way of presenting some of postman 's familiar themes , than a serious proposition \( he even includes a summary of his disappearance of childhood argument in an appendix \) it 's a shame , really , because the enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long , and postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what 's good and admirable about contemporary society to enlightened thinking for a much more substantial survey and defence of enlightenment thought and culture , read roy porter 's the creation of the modern world the british enlightenment
i would not neccessarily call this book christian it is more of an historical account , bible as literature type of book it does make you think about different aspects of jesus life , but most of that is speculation or perception yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end
this book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually no understanding of computer systems by the author i do n't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving , but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes , firewalls and hacking techniques , those details must be fairly correct in this case , the technical details were so wildly implausible that i finally had to stop reading the part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access nsa data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details the nsa almost certainly does n't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet \( through any combination of firewalls \) but if they did , they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked
this is one of the worst books ever , do n't buy it
i am a huge clyde edgerton fan , and i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed with this book it just never seemed to get off the ground i was expecting the type of story that i fell in love with in raney and walking across egypt \( both of which left me in tears , i laughed so hard \) if you 're looking for listre , you 're not going to find it in this book oh well , i guess i 'll wait on his next one
i had to read this book for a diversity class sennett uses language and sentence construction that is overly ostentatious and difficult to understand inside this fat book is a very thin book trying to get out he needed a good editor
the material is first rate but his writing style is horrid his five part typology of memory does n't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter the underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material there are much better and clearer books on the holocaust ! do n't bother with this one
i have sent away for a book called lord given lovers the holy union of david and jonathan as i find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages , now that david has been used in this subject as married to jonathan , in the days when the scibes who wrote the law against such things , i would like to know why david and jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law , and if david did such a thing , i would believe that all the jews then would have did so to , copying david and jonathan`s example
i was anxious to read the reviews on this book and i am happy to find its not just me ! her words and sentences are redundant ! yes wacky artist was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages ! liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter ! we know ! do n't tell us 100 times ! this is what i think either ms steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material or she 's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing is d steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work \? also , is it cold stone sober \? or stone cold sober \? \( it should have been the latter \) no editor caught that mistake \? i 've been a fan of ms steel 's work for 21 years now and the past few year 's works have been deplorable ! i first excused it due to the death of her son but her talent never picked up again from the ranch onward the books are just pure fluff if you want to read a novel and not think about what you 're reading then read her books , this one especially if you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try barbara delinsky , luanne rice , alison clement , susan wiggs
it has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher antony flew , the world 's number one atheist \( at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments \) has recanted his atheism
having read \( and thoroughly enjoyed \) levitt 's freakonomics , i picked up hidden order the economics of everyday life looking for more of the same unfortunately , i was sadly disappointed
if you are going to walt disney world resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions , then this book may not be for you some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step by step through them , including plot points in 3d movies and so on the book also leaves a lot out in other areas , such as dining \( little coverage \) , getting around walt disney world , and off site hotels and dining
mr friedman 's book begins with an interesting thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth the idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that friedman often well supports with historical facts however , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that , with a little thorough thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven with these things being the case , i find friedman 's argument a little hard to buy the entire book seems to build up to the final chapter , which friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book \( ie the importance of education \) do not add or support his final policy recommendations his policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question what should the government do to promote economic growth \? they do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies
for decades , african american studies scholars have left issues facing non heterosexuals to the side for years , queer scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side this anthology tries to address that void it goes a long way in proving that black , gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones the anthology has representative numbers of men and women in some ways , it 's a who 's who of black gay academia , including works from cathy cohen , dwight mcbride , and jewelle gomez
in a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book , popop from boston \( april 9 below \) alludes to some children blown up by an ira bomb in a north of england shopping center popop is very broad minded it pains him that anyone would bad mouth such armed operations they were perfectly justified , he explains , because of thousands of innocent irish catholics murdered at the hands of the british army
investment biker 1 1 2 stars , just barely escapes the lowest possible rating
the case for marriage makes arguments supportive of pres bush 's policies on marriage however , howard kurtz of the washington post \( 1 26 5 \) reports that maggie gallagher was paid over 40 , 000 by the bush administration to write columns and a private report supporting its 300 million hhs marriage initiative
i was lured into reading under the volcano after seeing its inclusion on the modern library 's one hundred best of the 20th century and after reading a reviewer compare it to james joyce \( i am an amateur joycean who tries to read ulysess , portrait of the artist , and dubliners at least annually \) lowry has nothing that likens him to joyce this book is leaden and tedious i forced myself to finish it because i hate to start a book and not finish it but it was no labor of love it was simply a labor
this is not one of lonely planet 's best guides there is suprisingly little information for example , the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services basically , everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in rekyavik , which luckily is run very well i found this really disappointing since iceland is very expensive and i was hoping to keep down costs \( in reality this is almost impossible , even eating at the grocery store i was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese \) furthermore , iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details
i think the linda howard who wrote white lies , sarah 's child , duncan 's bride , mackenzies mountain , diamond bay , etc is one of the most talented current romance writers
that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me luckily , i bought this book used , otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price between her utterly uninspired devotional dances to things such as sex , wisdom , and the sticky one \( a term she made up for the astral body \) , and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to anoint it , i was unimpressed , to say the least however , driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book it 's very , very amusing if you do n't take it seriously the thing that makes me sad is that she 's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth there 's nothing evolutionary about it , unless you consider being a wanton , idiotic freak evolutionary if this is what humanity is evolving into , i am frightend
this book dragged on and on the ending was stupid and the plot was pathetic very similiar to the devil wears prada which was also bad do n't waste your time on this one
unlike cussler 's other series , i found this first story of the oregon files slow going at first and rather confusing there are just too many things going on \( no problem , i suppose , for multi taskers ! \) and way too many characters to keep track of also , there 's little to no character development even of mr chairman , juan cabrillo the fact that he and his companions are mercenaries \( with a penchant for good deeds that pay well \) does n't compare favorably with the numa heroes however , the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides i expect from mr cussler and co writers i look forward to the subsequent oregon files with high hopes
sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian this book is awful the storyline is weak and predictable , the dialogue is excruciatingly lame , and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry there is virtually no romance , which is the reason to read sparks' books i ca n't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said , the way the dog seems to be human , and the predictability of the plot this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it if you want a good plot with romance mixed in , read message in a bottle or a walk to remember if you want suspense , read mary higgins clark or agatha christie they do a far better job with it than sparks does
i read this book and i think presented material is not practical in commercial applications in my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications i know this is something different from contracts , by i think contracts are to complex , hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems
some may disagree , and in fact , many have asked me why i disliked this one so much so , here is why
and the maps are worthless
this book is not very helpful and confusing to use a lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels if you buy those brands
gives many examples of weapons , most of which are useful
i found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what i was looking for the small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
it 's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content this book was so frustrating , i really wish i had saved myself the bother of reading it
the photos are beautiful , the designs are just wonderful but if you have kids this is not real life this is a magazine lifestyle you could only do this if you had an unlimited budget , there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets sure my home could be organized if i had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built ins , and all the baskets i could buy ! stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table
this book is mostly hype the writing is not that great japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world 's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work however the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way if you are a serious reader skip this book
this is a kids book first few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book
i keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are , but i have never found this to be so he always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it he seems more at home studying statistics \( which he includes everywhere \) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics i always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper , surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world all his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone just comments on them later still lots of people think he is grea
sorry guys , i looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media the graphics of the book are truly beautiful the recipes however , hmmm , try again i followed a simple recipe for apple crisp and got a bad result i now go to respected standard cookbooks for my apple crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great really people , the recipes are not the stuff of greatness graphics \? great photography \? great \? recipes \? you have got to be kidding
imagine , just as i was getting bored with this book , through an odd act of contingence its binding literally fell apart in my hands a loki eshu hermetic encounter \? what a thankful rescue rambling and indulgent , such repetition would be better kept to a long essay rather than a full book a trickster 's story , indeed
so you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about hemingway 's ghost and you 're ready to drop some cash , right \? guess what there 's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book ! in addition , old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic 's version of handel 's halleluja chorus instead , what 's offered here is a rehash of old stories \( and old theories about what ghosts could be \) with insipid , comic book illustrations why this is called a field guide with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon be it birds , plants , or mushrooms is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists if you 're a serious researcher of this subject , then pass this book up and seek hem 's fetch elsewhere
creepiest book ever
leaving the racism issue aside , this is not a book for small children even if everything turns out ok in the end , i'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between perhaps i'm a softie , but let 's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading just because it 's a classic does n't make it appropriate reading
racism is not the problem with this book sure 5 chinese brothers look alike maybe they look alike because they are brothers , not because they are chinese i bought this book because generally i love the books written in earlier times they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time this book does have engaging illustrations what i find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet
unfotrunately shantaram did not grab my imagination at all nor did i find it emotionally satisfying i realize shataram is meant to be a kind of bollywood story over the top , flowery , cliched etc but the bollywood movies i 've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying , despite their soppyness etc shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story
first i have to admit , i only read 150 pages of this book that was all i could possibly stand life is just too short to waste on a book you do n't enjoy reading
by arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of dignity and familiarity rather than sentience and feeling , fukuyama brings to mind the european colonists who considered africans no more than common beasts his philosophy , although argued in a tone that seems reasonable , is at turns startingly narrow minded and genetically racist not reccomended readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics
do n't waste your money on this book i will finish the book because it is our book club choice the characters are shallow and self centered the writing is middle school quality kris radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water no poetry and no beauty , i could care less about the women in this book who could possibly think life 's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine \? i treasure my sisters and women friends but i would n't want to be a friend to any of these women i would give it no stars if i could
the book is amazing ! the cd is horrible ! stick to reading the book yourself i have over 45 audio books and this was like listen to a bad commercial i had to turn it off there is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading they do n't even state who the narrator is !

sorry guys , i looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media the graphics of the book are truly beautiful the recipes however , hmmm , try again i followed a simple recipe for apple crisp and got a bad result i now go to respected standard cookbooks for my apple crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great really people , the recipes are not the stuff of greatness graphics \? great photography \? great \? recipes \? you have got to be kidding
all i could think was , damn , if i had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge , i 'd never be depressed i do n't know quite how to explain it , but i felt no empathy for him i only ended up feeling more depressed as a history of depression , the level of research was quite impressive
roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better based on the theories of david ricardo , the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible in the choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt ceos fables like the choice \( or the free market economy for that matter \) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple that 's why the book is dangerous the choice has almost nothing to do with the real world , but it sounds good the argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable if you buy roberts' version of ricardo , however , you must accept wal mart as the epitome of business virtue
this book turned out to be a disappointing resource although the book includes 20 , 001 names , many are unlikely and outlandish \( klotild , edwige , ghislain , ethelbert , birtle \) , making it arduous to sift through to find the names more worthy of consideration
an american tragedy by theodore dreiser is considered one of the greatest american books ever written this may be the case if you can get past the first chapter five times , i have tried to read this book to date , i am 0 for 5 , having fallen asleep each time trying to read it if you 're a bit of a lazy reader or one who does n't want to work through a book , this is not for you try mark twain instead

i 've read all of nevada barr 's anna pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until i reached hard truth after writing so many intellligent , suspenseful stories , barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime murder 's not nasty enough \? how about the murder of children \? still not gruesome enough \? add incest rape torture you get the picture
some times it is nice to have a book that points out the obvious you can be too close to a problem to notice the obvious unfortunately this book is too obvious and it is all fluff with no substance wait you say this is a design book what do you want \? code \? i really wanted design so where is it \? between the pages that tell how to use exotic tools to do what html can \? or is it between the lines that keep emphasizing speed \? or is it that this is one big advertisement for the contributors \? oh well , it makes you look scholarly to have this book on the koffee table
i own and have read all of ja jance 's jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character 's lives i picked this book up , thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i 've read previously what a crashing disappointment i ca n't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations truth be told , i kept looking at the cover to see if i 'd picked up a harlequin by mistake i 'll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series , but i 'd much rather see what happens with jp and joanna incidentally , i did n't think much of either of them , either , when their paths crossed some books ago this one gets a big aw , c'mon , ja , you can do much better than this ! from me for those who have n't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj , get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning they are worth the time and effort
considering that this is virtually the first attempt \( as far as i know \) at a dictionary of the pentecostal charismatic movement , this is a good start it is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws the title international leads one to expect much more coverage of pentecost outside of the u s canada , where pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the u s , is given very scanty treatment some major early canadian apostles , such as o j lovik , are skipped entirely there is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize a balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer , rather than by the leaders of those movements finally , there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires , above all else , keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff that said , i will consult my copy often , for the great amount of useful material it does contain
this book is filthy i had to take a shower after i read it why does n't he get a job \? why does he have to live in france \? why does n't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers \? so many questions people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned it was banned because it 's a bad book
mr winchester takes an interesting subject , collects enough material to make a fine article in , say , national geographic , and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length \( case in point , a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid , but loses it , and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss ick self induldgent boring \) worse , still , even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material , such as relates , say , to the subject 's wife , all mr winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations i guess extensive research might have been too time consuming numerous times i considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful , but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going , hence my review of two stars
while i applaud ms lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of janie hendrix 's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit , there are some very serious credibility problems here
bought this one for evolution class it is a horrible excuse for a textbook do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student if the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience , then i would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend university of washington
while i did find the book informative and a good supplement to robert sobel 's the great bull market wall street in the 1920s , galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s bull market way too much this makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read while i persevered to the end , i fouynd sobel 's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read
i was very disapointed by this book after just finishing the 400 pages book bull ! from maggie mahar which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles \( although the more recent boom of 1982 1999 \) , the great crash was really hard to read it totally shows its age \( it was written more than 50 years ago \) the language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time
i have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title as others have pointed out , coughlin 's ego can be suffocating at times this could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw alas it is not the writing is amateurish at best and the author 's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting the language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an english grad student
the beginning of this book was excellent , but dont be fooled , the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers what 's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were this was one of the worst books i have ever read , i 'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery dont waste your time reading it
several reviews of this book , published elsewhere , stress
i give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that nicholas wade has presented and in the manner it was presented , dna and the secret family of thomas jefferson
if you admired the young mccourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in angela 's ashes \( a 'sa \) , this book is sure a huge deception the first 80 pages are a great continuation to a'sa , but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops , as if mccourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas the storyline becomes chaotic , changing the day today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again , no order or sense whatsoever
like the other posters , i too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from china after reading the first chapter i found myself insulted this book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant , which is not my case while infertility is something that should not be ignored , and i appreciate the fact that most adoption books i read address the matter , this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive i was so insulted that i returned the book to my social worker with these concerns
i have long had the desire to read a grisham book , because i have heard good things well , my chance came and i was sorely disappointed the audio cd 's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber the opening to the book kept me going , but by chapter three , i had already decided this , if sam cayhall lives i'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes , and if he dies , he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the hero to the story sadly , i pursued curious about the ending i'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book , because it only took six hours to get through it sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author mayber grisham 's other books are better , but i wo n't be reading them
we live in a man 's world women are raped , abused , beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification this is an epidemic problem , and christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population
the principle question that arises from a reading of soul by soul by walter johnson is why was this book written \? it is touted as history , yet not only does it lack any original historical material , it also lacks any discernable historical facts rather than history , soul by soul seems to be a mean spirited , emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas 1 that white people living in the antebellum south were universally loathsome , brutish and cruel and 2 that black people living in the antebellum south were universally noble , good and abused to support his views , professor johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings his personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book 's long deceased characters and divine their true , but unspoken , motives and thoughts quite a feat for any historian ! one loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their probing fingers in this book fortunately , in between probes , the reader can be shocked by the killing fields of the lower south , the historical sexualization of black bodies , the slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves , and the brutish perogatives of whiteness this is heavy , hate filled stuff worthy of a tv mini series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text i live in a former slave quarter in new orleans in the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the emancipation proclamation as an amateur historian , i would have thought that a book about the new orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets what were their addresses \? what percentage of their customers were black \? what percentage were white \? how many slaves did the typical new orleans household have \? how were they fed and clothed \? what were their working hours \? these are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , repetitious , boring rehash of tired , previously published material in short , this book , for the most part , reads like a rambling , overly long sermon anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the slave narratives compiled by the federal writers project , time on the cross by robert fogel and stanley engerman and the slave trade by hugh thomas the first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the w p a in the 1930 's the latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery , not the emotions
sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of cosulting business but then , for the price of this book , i would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas such as consulting for dummies the book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant but come on , consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural , systematic yet creative thinking overall , i think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant while for beginner , the reader will risk the wrong impression that it 's this easy to win a consulting work highly unlikely in a complex and competative world
another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation if you dig that sort of thing there are tons out on the market unfortunately they do n't come with disclaimers like one would get when reading a book on the occult people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view , and this is a fine example it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it it is a living when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot 's guide to the code , how to interpret the code etc etc i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism or in this case the secret agenda before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad
a biography about a boy and a very tough and brave one who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors \( or killed and maimed \) of iwo experienced he saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice by strict definition , this act was deserving of the medal of honor his terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching , but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of iwo veterans , or any other battle , i have read the other accounts i have read generally conclude war is a horrible thing to experience , and not glorious , but i would do it again
this book states that it 's better to die than survive a rape
this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept , but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist , the prose is stiff , and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading , but i really did n't get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation which takes place after the press conference , where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it 's a title to read if you wish to be considered well read despite its faults , valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten , just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird
sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that three junes was listed as a popular book choice the title sounded interesting so i bought it that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition it is difficult to follow the timeline , to understand the characters and where they fit , and to get involved in the storyline i will finish the book because that 's my style it has not been a book that i could not wait to get back to
sadly this second book left me unsatisfied for one , wouk 's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second of course , once one has read through the first book , its hard to stop yet , by the end of war and remembrance i was thoroughly sick and annoyed by wouk 's characters it 's hard to relate to super humans , who constantly do super human feats most of the characters in the book come from superior stock , graduate from the top universities , have extremely good looks , and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane
the book was fun but the fact that it is too long overshadowed all this fun i got the impression it was rather written to become a movie all i can say is that thanks to c bushnell for 'sex and the city'
i'm sorry to say , this work will not rate very highly on my scale
miniter takes advantage of the american ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole maybe he could get together for a book with ann coulter
like everyone of you , i am crazy about my toddler i got this book and the book of wendy s masi' toddlers play the comarison day and night kuffners book might have 365 activities , but it really bad organized i am a first time parent , so i need some help guidance thsi is why i baught this bbok
without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and steve allen 's pivitol role it sadly ben alba 's inventing late night steve allen and the original tonight show'' , is not that book it is , largely , a poorly edited and self contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with allen 's tv contemporaries these interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers scott berg \( sam goldwin \) or neal gabler \( walter winchle \)
it truly is the best war fiction regarding wwii if you have never read any other fiction regarding wwii i love war fiction and non fiction and beside parroting the time magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel i can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion to me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating what it is , is a bloated , narcisstic , misogynistic waste of time
i enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things i would n't eat in the first place
communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history , responsible for the extermination of 100 million people this book \( which started it all \) holds at least much of the blame communists were and still are a threat to the free world , and communism is a slave system some intellectuals actually support the tired mantras of marx 's philosophy , whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who have n't seen enough sunlight , i do n't know in any case , if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property , and is totalitarian and slave driving \( the government owns everything , including you \) and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up pol pot , mao , stalin \( of course \) , etc etc who are these people kidding
not sure this is the book to study for the pmp agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it also , the intergration knowledge area is missing i think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better
this book irritated me on many levels not that the writing was poor or the plot weak in fact , the plot , the premise , the writing were good unfortunately the characters did n't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable
this book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough french to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory i found french in 10 minutes a day much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook
i ca n't remember the last time i failed to finish reading a novel i abandoned this one with 100 pages to go with another implausible plot twist , i 've had enough
i have been a huge fan of dean koontz for years , ever since my mom got me to read watchers but this story is just way too slow just when i thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride it would slow way down again i almost put it down halfway through the book , but i kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner about 2 3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining but i just felt like something was missing most of the time i was reading i just could n't get into the characters i would n't recommend this book to any first time dean koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off do n't judge his work by this novel
if you are interested in learning about the actual science of food , but do n't want to learn any science , at least read a book by someone who did learn it there is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely oil is more dense than water and that 's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212 as a chemist and formulator i can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water , and even if it were n't that 's not the reason it has a higher boiling point ever make oil and vinegar salad dressing \? ever seen crude oil on the ocean \? how about the funk on top of old greasy dish water \? folks , oil floats on water and the earth is not flat either this guy is a complete moron , or he is a very clever con artist either way , save your money and buy that blind amish author 's book semiconductor microengineering for dummies instead it 's better researched
i was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of paris , a city i have visited often the book fell far short of that it left me disappointed and longing for what i had missed it was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject as an example , she tells us that moving within paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth where were her feelings , little experiences , failings , successes , reactions overall , the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it
24 95 is way too expensive for a book that is only 100 pages other than that the content in the book is good
normally i do n't take the time to write a review , but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good , but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of 30 books that i paid 15 for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it
the companion web site mentioned in the book is not there when i typed in that url , i got redirected to peachpit 's advertising site of this book , but no links , tools , nor examples mentioned in the book at all !
between the glamour shots and easy sex , different babys' daddys what else is there \? oh yeah , the many scripture quotes and abortion info dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school poor amber !
i absolutely love janet evanovich and the stephanie plum series , so when i saw this new series of books with her name on it , i grabbed them up i could n't even finish reading this book it was so bad the whole talking car concept was , frankly , just stupid this was like watching an episode of knight rider , but without david hasselhoff the characters are flat , and the dialogue is stilted and contrived i can only believe that charlotte hughes did most of the writing , and why on earth would evanovich attach her name to this \? needless to say , i will not be reading the rest of the series spend your money on something worth reading
do n't sell it to one country on microfilm for a lot of money , sell it to everybody in hard cover for 20 00 a pop somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what risen has done here , and what the walkers were imprisoned for
i ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it it was terrible ! tanya holland is a beautiful black woman , but i feel has gone too far out of the way to create innovative and different recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food the price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook i collect african american soul food cookbooks among others if you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent , your money would be better spent on essence brings you great cooking by jonell nash , the ebony cookbook by freida deknight or the black family reunion cookbook by the the national council of negro women if you are interested in healthier soul food try , the new ebony cookbook by charlotte lyons or the family dinner quilt cookbook by the national council of negro women if you are interested in diverse , cultural flavors , i would recommend vertamae grosvenor 's cookbooks or iron pots and wooden spoons by jessica b harris i have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks they cover the gamut that is why i can give an honest opinion on tanya holland 's book i just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average african american can relate to one that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking
i 've always been a big believer in attack the message \( if you do n't agree \) , do n't attack the messenger the reverse has been almost standard practice of the left when they ca n't refute the truth , facts and common sense of conservatives which is close to 100 of the time
i recently read this as part of a survey of childrens' literature about the medieval period let me say first , that the dialogue is completely modernized , with not even a complex word to redeem it i know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect , but please , our children are more sophisticated than that adam is self involved , careless , and annoyingly stupid despite it 's touted 320 pages , this could have been printed in 150 , and contained much the same material the only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of latin and old english ballads scattered throughout if you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times , with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability , have them read song of the gargoyle it 's also about a boy who loses his father , and has to search for him , in the company of a dog like being , but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash the boy is also a minstrel , of sorts , but he has more likable qualities than adam , as well as more adventures in less pages the ending is a happy one , but it involves a twist , which is n't at all forseeable , as theat in adam of the road please , just skip this , i do n't care if it won a newberry award , and read song of the gargoyle , by zylpha keatly snider
early on the author tells how he proved to concept of learned helplessness through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered
my all time favorite book is deavers the blue nowhere and the testament by another author i think this book is on the bottom of my list it was a combo term paper and novel i wonder where the editor of this book is where was he she \? it read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them
well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some unusual experiences \( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening \) , but the question is , is it all as it seems \? the fact of the matter is , various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys \( this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events \) there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario advanced , drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now \( verichip \) i'm not saying that other lifeforms do n't exist in the universe \( far from it \) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are little , menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us historically , there 's been the barbarians , huns , mongols , pagans , jews , christians , vikings , black natives , cannabals , red natives , mexicans , germans , nazis , communists , now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80 's the fact is that with known technology \( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked \) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced \( albeit underground \) than most people can fathom what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised , of which strieber has been front and centre at various times my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign , sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups in this book , his hard evidence is flimsey and suspicious for example , why would n't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue \( thus not showing up on any x ray , mri , ct , etc \) \? and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body \? surely , this would be child 's play for alien scientists \? why no major discussion or mention of the human military , or nazi connection with abductions \? there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange fragments of memories that are slipping through various memory covers why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys \? why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms \? why are some speaking english , others german \? why is there a connection with deep , underground bases and specifically antartica \? these are things strieber never mentions , which i find curious my point is , things are happening , but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what , and strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas
john r barry \( another digital communications textbook author \) first introduced me to this text and mr barry , as with many com theory persons i 've met since \( gtri in atlanta , ga mitre along around the boston area of ma northrup in el segundo , ca intersil in palm bay melbourne , fl \) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs essentially , it 's their bible the only problem is that the values and beliefs in proakis , especially from an engineering perspective , are very third rate trying to use this text in a classroom situation , especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor , is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective
i used to follow politics but now i know better clinton is a hero to poor folk in the us only bc bush is such a nazi , sorry , but clinton did more than any pres in us history to cut welfare to the moms who need it the most ! i ai n't no fool partisan of a richmans party and i do n't like america and yes i'm born and raised in the us , there is no democracy here , only a moneycracy ! ! ! power to the ppl lets make a real country for the ppl , not the capitalist leech scum ! !
i am supposed to get 16th edition , instead i received 15th edition the book was completely changed from the previuos editio
i came to blowback by way of a year long research project on globalization over the past year i have read dozens of books , both scholary and popular , on this topic right left love america hate america multi cultural eurocentric i 've suffered through them all \( happily , there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject \)
this book is inexplicably influential , probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis , instead delivering an exasperating 300 page long list of every single thing on earth that he disagrees with barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world , while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass culture sameness interestingly , barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance , using each other 's excesses as excuses for their anti democratic behavior that is a fascinating thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating
in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , cultural , religious , nationalistic , etc , depending on where you look on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in groups and out groups on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace
this is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing , and cite each other or similar data and research the authors do write well , so i gave it two stars but it has under overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system dump more money into schools teachers are underpaid and overworked high stakes standardized testing is bad folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of jay p greene 's educational myths to run a little de tox on the stuff they read here
this was a comprehensive collection of statistics and war department strategy notes but it had no life it gave no feel for the soldier , sailor or marine on the ground it was all acronyms and big picture strategy if you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war , the participants should get more ink here , the brass get all the attention
i found the book informative while reading it , but also a bit confusing and a little dry , best used for a college course and not for recreational reading \( which is no doubt why we even had it in our house , someone had to use it and it 's equally boring companion for some college course , i'm certain of it
sure , i had fun reading this book but the amazon reviewer who termed it highly speculative is understating the case opinion , conjecture , hearsay , and speculation too often take the place of thorough , solid documentation and unlike many other amazon reviewers , i found mclellan 's tone off putting she alternates between patronizing her subjects \( the very notion of calling them my girls , for instance \) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant \? you bet but is the topic of lesbianism in hollywood well served here \? i do n't think so
judging by the long reviews before me , it should be obvious that there is much to say about calvin 's theology this book does n't say too much for those familiar with his theology , don't buy this book it will be a waste of your money for those who would like to know more about calvin 's theology , without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology , buy this if you want a good in depth coverage of calvin 's theology , buy the full version and enjoy
if you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here
in the possibility that steve berry could ever transcend his not so great debut , the amber room romanov prophecy started in the right direction , third secret was ok , but i think he hit his peak right there
jesus , talk about the little girl crying wolf when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew knows how to deal with what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption
the author is certainly writing for a target audience as one other reviewer said , white , upper middle class , female would be mystics i found the stories of life on the commune mind numbing \( then again , i was born in berkeley in 1970 , so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when i was a kid \) and the rest of what i did manage to read alienating zzzzzzzzzzzz i am not saying this is a bad book at all , just that it 's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest the language was so fuzzy and woo woo that it just irritated my gen x \( for lack of a better word \) postpunk sensibility it 's a shame , too , as i was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality c'est la vie
the book is basically a dictionary of terms in the computer graphic field all most the whole book contain very simple ideas and concept i knew already
this is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced regardless of where you stand politically , johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree throughout this work johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities
this was a terrible disappointment more of a memoir than anything about book collecting , it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was there seemed to be no context or fabric to the book
sheppard 's attempt to capture the american youth angst failed miserably instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through i never developed any connection or understanding of the characters each chapter seemed to stumble into the next , with the end as predictable as the next expletive sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge you 'd do better saving your money , driving to the nearest mall , and find the kid in the anarchy t shirt looking sullen , because it appears that is all sheppard did in this work phew stinker rooney !
this book is seriously out of date for modern web design and development
i read this in jan of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes here goes trashy , but i could n't not finish it story of best friends who go to a summer house every august with their families secret betrayals of friendship , a hidden illness , a birth and a miscarriage what else do you need to make a soap opera style plot \? i give thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage , from envy to despair bottom line rich people with too much money and rich people problems it did n't stay in my short term memory very long
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution
as a long time fan of nicholas sparks , i was a little disappointed in this book the potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more the entire book takes place in this little bed and breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters there just was n't enough going on in this book to keep my attention
it is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject the reviewers who have lamented the short , choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another , without benefit of full explanation or connection , are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book i had to read some paragraphs several times and even then did n't understand what i was reading it was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind , as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on the description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages , which incited one yawn after another the book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances for example , the narrative is littered with sentences like she made for the east exit okay , fine , but did she run , walk , crawl , hop , skip , jump , or fly to the east exit \? i just do n't know what to picture there the word made says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen this type of problem occurs on every page of the book i have n't read anything else the author has written , so i hate to be so critical i wonder , however , why his editor did n't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions i felt as if i was reading a very hastily prepared early draft i have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations this just is n't one of them compare the circus fire to into thin air , heart of the sea , batavia 's graveyard , or ordeal by hunger and you 'll understand what i mean
since i listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as tony roberts performance was so bad , it was impossible to follow the story line he read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did in addition to the slooooow reading , his characterization were completely over the top dino sounded like a moron and billy bob well like a texas moron and what about billy bob , that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story
a much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story the end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
toward the end of how now shall we live , chuck colson states , regarding popular music and media , that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet however , he warns , a diet of junk food can be fatal
i borrowed this from my sister in law to read it is the first barr book i have read i did not like it because of several reasons first of all , the vulgar language was too much one can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter second , it was so mundane for a mystery the writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in yellowstone national park
just enough is more than enough a turgid , pretentious , strident , and wholly unoriginal piece of work its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior , nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self help pop business literature at best , this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the harvard business review , but surely not enough material for 280 pages ! better to read do what you love , the money will follow discovering your right livelihood , by marsha sinetar , and call it a day
well , i thought that the book was coming when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder they did let me get a refund which was nice i would use them again for that reason alone
all i could think was , damn , if i had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge , i 'd never be depressed i do n't know quite how to explain it , but i felt no empathy for him i only ended up feeling more depressed as a history of depression , the level of research was quite impressive
please take this to heart
it is difficult , nay , impossible , to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious , money worshipping parasites , and that is exactly what we have in this novel
i like john grisham , but the king of torts was a slow moving disappointment grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is fine , but he ends up putting the message above the story
owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk he comes off as arrogant , showing little empathy towards debra 's problems earlier on in their marriage \( eating disorder , depression , social anxiety \) he writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble debra was in , but instead are very embarrassing to her he comes across as a husband with no compassion it 's ironic that he goes on and on about debra 's poor choices in boyfriends over the years , and how they were always so controlling of her and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and debra did n't keep the house tidy and he did n't approve of the way she dressed ! ! seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated he repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is , his gpa , jobs , earning potential , etc but then admits that when they separated , he sticks debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off ! he says it was in her name , so she can have it ! owen shows how little a man he really is in this book debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid , and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart , she would n't have gone down the road she did i feel very sorry for debra after reading this book
this is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you 've probably never heard of if you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you
a sad reminder that history is written by the victors i wonder how americans would feel if al qaeda would write a similar book glorifying the 9 11 attacks disgusting
mark twain called the book of mormon chloroform in print and he was n't kidding it is by far the most boring read i have encountered \( i could barely get through it \) i am a woman of faith faith in god and faith in christ and i do n't know how anyone could believe this rubbish please , anyone who is taking this at all seriously do some research on the church ask some hard questions \( you will likely get a rehearsed answer , but it 's worth a shot \)
while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife i'm very tender when it comes to wildlife , and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle , i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos , then this is not the book for them otherwise , i would recommend it
i have nothing more to say than i 've already said in my headline lou dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me
i 've read every one of iris johansen 's suspense novels and have loved most of them the last couple though have been so painful to get through this one however , i do n't think i can even finish i read where someone called these characters cardboard , and i could n't agree more the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters , it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters makes me think of a writing 101 class now this should happen here , and this here , and this here and boom , climax , happily every after
mark rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in america most of his ideas are solid , but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word interesting to describe it did they actually read it \?
forget the tom wolfe comparison this book is simply boring ! i'm half through reading it , but i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen if nobody tells me that the second half is much , much better than the first , i'm going to throw it away \( which i rarely do \) how could i believe this excellent book review \( in a swiss newspaper \)
i appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there but this book has way too much i read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men
you know , i hate to burst the bubble of devoted trotskyites across the globe , but trotsky was just as responsible for stalin 's rule as anyone for leon to blame stalin is the height of hypocrisy without lenin 's apparatus of social repression and trotsky 's apparatus of military dictatorship , stalin would never have been
i thought keegan was a serious historian this book contains little to do with the actual war itself you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel indeed i beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a serious miltary analysis of the iraq war
the self improvement books how to win friends and influence people and talking the winner 's way are both way superior to this short book most of what you read is basically review if you 've ready other similar books and what 's present does n't pack enough substance or how to to make it really worth your time about half way through the book , gabor started presenting fresh ideas the problem , however , is that it was half way through the book not a bad read , but there 's so much better if you happen across it one day on the street , it wo n't do any harm to read it but i ca n't recommend paying money for something you already know , or can get for a better deal
the book is entertaining , however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent any time studying the ancient world to any degree you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events , biblical texts , and blatantly stretched \( pun so intended \) the truth on so much i 'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong , but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol if you take away any claim of being a historical reference , this book is good it 's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does totally not serious , but a giggle to be had here and there some of which is at the author 's expense
when i first got diagnosed with add \( as an adult \) i believe the exact phrase you mean i'm not lazy , crazy or stupid \? went through my mind finally , there was an explanation
have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on \? for me , that was this book if you like fantasy then you might like this , because that is the genre of this book it is about a jewish girl named hannah she goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door she opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream she now has a new name , chaya she now has to figure out what happened , and what she will do in this body it takes place in new rochelle it is old times it does n't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting she does n't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it
i picked up this book at the airport as i was heading to japan while staying with my in laws in the country , there is no english language anything this is all i brought so i had to finish it but it was a struggle
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
this book provides nothing new it is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck if you have 401k , duh , it does that automatically anyway , boring it also says to save money , do n't use credit cards , pay yourself , blah , blah , blah oh yeh , if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years zzzz ok , it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks one idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account upon reading this , i decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal 2 i 've been earning on my saving account and not realizing the latest craze started by ing , all the other banks offer an online savings account which offers 5 compare to the dismal 2 i immediately switched ! other than this part of the book , it was boring
the reviewer below who said more heat than light got it partly right this book is so badly written you have to wonder if the author 's other works were written by the same person not only is it sophomoric , it is gibberish had its author been unknown , she would surely have had to pay for the book 's publication incredibly bad , it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers
after reading deep south and flashback , i was looking forward to going back and reading some of the earlier anna pigeon books liberty falling has to be the worst of the pigeon series i found myself skimming over pages and skipping over the last third of the book to get to the end and hope the ending would make it worth the read it was n't
for someone who spends his career attacking politically motivated science , stephen jay gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of modern science like samuel morton and francis galton , and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct for anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science stephen jay gould is a paleontologist evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all other crypto marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it
before i started reading zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance , the book had a lot going for it stellar reviews on the cover , an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at walden books in pocatello
i'm at page 116 right now the writing is lovely , the specifics dense , and the sense of place rich if the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say , i just ca n't go on with this story ! i'm going to throw the book at the wall also , so many embarrassing little holes if i were a librarian i would say , so dracula 's checked out go to a bookstore every bookstore in the country has a copy and if i were the cat , i would know i was a goner the second i appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph \( you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you 're going to fire it \) lastly , it seems like dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them unless dracula is related to our heroine that would be good will read a bit more
overall i found this guide pretty confusing , but i guess it is better than nothing there are better choices , and some may want to consider auto formatting software such as eazypaper and others
i read this book , it was okay but the story flashed back to much , and i could n't folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i would n't recommend it too slow moving , and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way
let me start by saying that i would have given this book zero stars if i could the reviews i 've read are all true this book is boring , extremely repetitive and a waste of time the only reason i finished it was because i paid for it
this is the second nevada barr that i have read i picked it up on the strength of deep south , which i thought was really terrific it was frustrating that nearly all of what i liked about deep south was missing from flashback
design of book is very poor pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story the translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
i was not impressed with this book it is just basic stuff i would have expected a more sophisticated analyis of financials from this publisher
i expected information about design , but this is just a self serving i am good at what i do book i am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture no proportions , no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first a waste of good money
if an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery , you 'd think they 'd have a lo say about it , right \? well , ford certainly expends plenty of words , but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel gazing group of stories mind numbingly similar in tone and temperament , the ten stories center of upper and upper middle class white , middle aged , married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity story after story plods cautiously along , poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way , with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite of passage for a disconnected male marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons , and yet ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it i have no idea what his personal background or situation is , but it 's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something if he was n't such a literary bigshot , there 's no way this would have been published it strikes the same note over and over and over , and is n't provocative , insightful , or even interesting ps if you were planning on the audio version , do n't ford is a terrible reader , sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment
essentially you get what you pay for this book is certanly not representative of what i have come to expect from national geographic
if hz 's sensationalist title gives you pause , you 're on to something the story preston narrates is , indeed , terrifying it is a story about disease , politics , epidemiology , history , geography so much could have been made of this story \( and so much has been , by far more capable writers \) preston , it seems , is only capable of going for the jugular hz shows no evidence of research \( it lacks even a trace of a bibliography \) , and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp , on the part of its author , of the history , epidemiology , or politics of ebola \( no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic \) from its opening page stroll through the air lock doors of a bio containment research lab , to its closing page 'death defying' romp through kitum cave \( how very brave of you , rp ! \) , hz is in full pandering for the cameras mode if this book was not a thinly veiled hollywood screenplay , i 'll eat my proverbial hat even this might have been tolerable were preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer hz is all cliches and lazy reporting it is an embarassment
most of the information is very theoritical and limited author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her in a nutshell , the message is that a dysfunctional mother 'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter \( s \) , and in turn , the daughter \( s \) may pass that onto her offspring \( s \)
the official censes of the ottoman empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million christians living in the provinces of what are now modern turkey western specialists who helped the turks conduct their censes stated that the turks purposely undercounted the christians and overcounted the turks so , there were many more than just five million christians there are now approximately only a hundred thousand christians in modern turkey the question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today we know that over a million surviving greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between greece and turkey in 1923 again , what happened to the huge difference of 4 5 million people \? to the 1 5 million massacred armenians , must be added three quarters to a million assyriac christians \( aramaic speaking arab christians \) and as many as two million greeks \( almost 30 percent of the greek people \) the author does not touch on the large numbers of christians who were enslaved by turks or forced to convert to islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number greek speaking turks around trebizon on the black sea
karl marx , years ago , gave a description of why this might be happening he followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make
pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers , whose very existence and relevance is due to that king what you will get from that kind of writing \? noonan was a speechwriter reagan administration sound familiar \? noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings probably she does not care americans are lucky that they never had any king noonan fails to provide any inside information how reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency aids , iran contra , welfare , deficits , funding mujahideens , cozy relationship with saddam instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a disney feelgood fairytale good ruler , happy citizens happily lived ever after basically , this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers do n't know already this is a writing isolated from the reality of 80 's \( which is nothing new in human civilizations \) secondly , she fails to understand that reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency including average hard working americans but she gives all the credits to reagan , except all the negative things , like iran contra in the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash a perfect place for the kings , characters of kings and the writings about them
my grandmother and my mother have read danielle steele for years , but i must admit i 'd never picked one up i was always more for historical romances but i wanted something different , had heard good things about her , so while at the library , decided to give her a try i have to say i'm extremely disappointed granted , i'm a fellow writer \( a very picky reader by nature \) , and an unpublished one to boot , but the writing could 've been better in my opinion the first five pages are all backstory of paris 's marriage \( no action , no excitement , told very history lesson ish \) and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between paris and her husband \( the inciting incident in the first chapter \) left me wondering , so what \? twenty five pages in , i could care less about these people i honestly expected more from a bestselling author
i wonder if im reading the same book the others are reading i'm on page 101 right now and it took me about 4 days to get this far \( i 've gone through 3 clique books in a day , so it 's not like i'm a slow reader \) the book is just so boring its like ive read all of this cr p before ! so far sam had a graduation party at her dad 's yacht , we hear about 2 new characters from a rival school who happen to be enemies of sam and her group and conveniently enough the two schools do something together , i forget what but it looks like it will be the opportunity for sam to get her revenge for getting poop smeared on her white jeans a few years back \( eye roll \) anna is incapable of taking care of herself at a time of crisis \( her car gets rear ended by some cliche white trash woman \) so her dad 's 'dont judge a book by the cover cliche' tatooed but hot new intern comes to rescue her , omg romance ! \( another eye roll \) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her , but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book ! it was so annoying
after having read and loved howard pyle 's 1968 classic press
so very boring i gave up halfway in i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time my sister liked it though
as i 've said before national hypnosis ! ! ! liberals want to dupe the masses into believing that modern conservatism and lberalism are different ideologies \( they both come from hegel and machiavelli the philosophies that gave birth to communism and facism \)
mr wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included the reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic work in 5 classes of 40 50 kids each day who ca n't read \( many are moved up so they can be with their friends \) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside
these are revised remarks since my comments about prediabetes and stop diabetes being the same book i got them both and felt somewhat duped
i have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow she did n't say how slow though but rather than take her word for it \( why should i \? after all , she 's my wife \) i bothered to pick it up and read it how i wish i had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale i cannot stand baldacci 's juvenile charactor dialog , but finish it i did though most of it i could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything i 'll stick with my nelson demille from here on if i want literary junk food
this book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information 's significance becomes blurred , if not obsolete the authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject , but they fail to analyze the information they present the reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included the authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective the only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph , and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences while this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages , the average reader 's attention is never captured students , beware ! before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life , reconsider your other options of reading material \( one option is another book by these authors that has gotten better reveiws
attention seasoned realestate investers do n't waste your time purchasing this book ideal for amatuer investors who want to add more value to their piece of real estate
i found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the sham \( self help actualization motivational \) movement is , and maybe even on why it is , but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it i thought , sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain washing in such a humorous way , that the author might have a sense of humor herself and i 'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well
a friend recommended this book which i unfortunately bought i feel sorry for people who think that this is writing the author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth if you want to feel good , buy yourself a bottle of wine , not this book
this play explores the same old turf as death of a salesman , but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development eddie is no willy loman , though , and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central , driving force like willy parts of the play seem borrowed from tennessee williams , and they do n't seem to work in this context there is some business about the romance of the old world italy versus the new world of opportunity on the docks of new york , and it is the only topic that is at all explored well , if still unsatisfactorily eddie 's dreams are represented in his pretty niece , catherine and unlike willy loman 's uncle , she is still an attainable dream that makes eddie 's life seem all the more petty , in comparison to willy 's he longs wearily not after what he could have had , but after what he can never have , as he is already married the death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced , tacked on ending , and alfieri 's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick there are better plays by miller , and many better plays by others
before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead as it turns out i made the best decision all i can say is `thank you fellow reviewers' this book was definitely not worth the purchase price my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a skilled writer it has everything to do with his lack of insight that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary i read the book , waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book
after reading the first book \( which was catastropha \) and reading the second which was really good , i thought that the series is taking off , i was mistaken , the third book is slow , and boring , you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series
this book reads like the blog of some angry person who ignores evidence to the contrary and embraces anything that agrees with him it was very hard to take seriously
since god is infinite goodness , we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion when we are comfortable , we are too shallow minded to realize that we need god since god knows that he is the only thing that we really need , he inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact so pain is god 's megaphone if some people , such as the jews , try to love god without going through christ , it is not yet god merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain hence poor god is forced to keep screeching at them through his megaphone but even people who try their hardest to love the true god , such as job , or c s lewis for that matter , cannot adore god as much as he wants to be adored , so he uses pain over and over again to plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls
i 've enjoyed johansen 's books for years , but this one was awful i'm beginning to wonder if she 's using a ghost writer totally ridiculous plot , trite dialogue i lost count of the times she used the phrase sophie said through her teeth i was beginning to wish someone was pulling my teeth rather than having to read this book johansen is capable of so much better than this ! i'm praying she is n't falling into the nora roberts danielle steel james patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher 's deadline
i am a chef and an avid collector of cookbooks i find the recipes of this book to be mediocre at best , terribly organized and lengthy i am not interested in lawson 's endless anecdotes , rather , i would prefer her stories to be replaces by pictures \( an essential for cooking books , in my opinion \) , of which there are none i was disappointed , and would not recommend this book to anyone for basic , great recipes , i would suggest any of ina garten 's books her recipes are no fail and the books are well done
this is truly a disappointing book it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels \( 1 \) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl \( the young female protagonist in the hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality \) , \( 2 \) devoted , super powered canine companions , \( 3 \) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped out rvs , and \( 4 \) evil bioethicists
sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that three junes was listed as a popular book choice the title sounded interesting so i bought it that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition it is difficult to follow the timeline , to understand the characters and where they fit , and to get involved in the storyline i will finish the book because that 's my style it has not been a book that i could not wait to get back to
as an admirer of theodore roosevelt , i was very disappointed in mr brands' book it appeared to me that mr brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic 's point of view while any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man , mr brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of tr 's actions tr was by no means a perfect man , however , history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents one gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of tr that mr brands'truly disliked his subject
i 'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara 's father 's great book , the killer angels it is not fair to compare the two , but because reading the father 's book lead me to buy this one , i thought i should mention it this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father 's book it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg , so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle but the result is a less satisfying book it skims rather than digs deep
when i started reading this book , i was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically correct word choice unfortunately , i did not find it to be particularly clever or funny on some level , it seems like the pc craze has subsided since the mid 90 's when the book was written , and it just does n't read as the brilliant critique that i expected we 've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix challenged that it just is n't funny anymore i suppose that this book worked much better when it was written , but it has n't aged well over the ten years since
the chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the french perspective by using citations in french with no translations i took 2 years of high school french but i'm not that good ! this could be overlooked except that , for obvious reasons , i was very interested to hear the perspective of french writing on this lopsided defeat the experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline , or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel i simply ca n't believe key citations were n't translated
i must admit i was skeptical when i first opened this book based on previous knowledge i had of mpd this book made me that much more skeptical in most cases of mpd or did as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist this case is different though on page 67 of the paperback copy i got , ms chase describes stanley \( her name for phillips \) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other her answer that she or as she claims her troops give is that it is through the use of thought transference which was known to the ancient greeks as she tells us later on i almost burst out laughing when i read that she also contradicts her claim that the alters do n't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters rabbit and sister mary catherine at the same time another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we' many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies the abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories , ufo sightings , satanic ritual abuse , and second sight i think she is not credible in the least there is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them she does let us know in the book that she is very creative , artistic , intelligent , and apparently well read i think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities the book itself is long , boring , anti climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end she also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities do n't waste your money on this book , unless you have to read it for a class as i did
this book just rambles on and on and never seems to end i do n't think i have ever been so disappointed in a book since i started to read it , i feel like i have to finish it i am just praying for that day to come soon i have to skip over entire paragraphs just to get through a chapter it is overwhelming proof that hippies should never write books
this book blew my ballz it was possibly the worst book i have ever read in my entire life although i am usually sleepless in seattle , i found myself falling asleep each time i tried to read it i advise no one to ever read this godforsaken book
i was there , as were several of my fellow sitka fire department emt 's and state troopers from the sitka academy the 6 of us , along with two parajumpers from the canadian armed services were flown through the typhoon winds , on a helicopter , out to the williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed we knew there was a doctor onboard , from anchorage , but we literally never met or saw him i'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up but that is where he stayed the real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend but i was disappointed to see that mr jeffers failed to fully research this book the role the sitka rescue teams played \( both on the williamsburgh and trying to assess fight the fire on the prinsendam \) was totally overlooked despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story which was the human side and had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event i was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out , was very sad at least we all have our commendations from both the coast guard commendant and the canadian armed services they knew we were there ! too bad mr jeffers did n't due diligence
tropic of cancer by henry miller not recommended
this book was a complete waste it was boring to read and hard to follow i finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion i never should have read past the first chapter read pop goes the weasle , or lake house by patterson just not this book it is hard to believe it is written by the same author
have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you would n't feel bad \? have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him \? in this story , the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he 's still a good guy because good guys do n't do bad things dizzing logic , huh \? throughout the novel , you review his senior year of high school with him it starts out with the story of how he got the nickname killer to why it 's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue the flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he did n't rape her he wo n't let her leave the room until she believes it the ending is less than satisfactory for me i would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice
jesus , talk about the little girl crying wolf when i picked up this book , i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew knows how to deal with what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption
this book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional this is absolutely not the case this book covers very , very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion i would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement
as a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler , this book was a big disappointment ! ! ! i bought this book after reading the reviews and wish i had n't paid more than 1 for it while the title the unprocessed child accurately describes laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with other unschooling literature the author , while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in love you forever who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son 's room at night to spend time with him sweet but a bit creepy the fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with laurie pretty much says it all the mother clearly has her own issues that i hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24 7 with her only child we have been unschooling each of our four children since birth challenging temperments and all and i feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them if you want to read a good book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter , i would recommend homeschooling our children , unschooling ourselves those authors offer more balance and eloquence than ms fitzenreiter
sheer and utter this hardly can be called a work of fiction had this been his first work , i could understand the grammatical mistakes , but this is inexcuseable the publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired
this was my first reading of jamaica kincaid she has a short , concise style , which made me often feel like i was reading poetry however , i felt that it also had some downsides , like stifling character growth in lucy , the title character comes to america to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother , who for some reason she hates i wish we knew a bit more about lucy , like why she hated her homeland so much it was an alright quick read , but had it been longer , i doubted it would have held my attention
hmmm i'm struggling to give agatha christie such a low rating she wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into not quick reads , but very methodical with lots of character development i do n't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow moving chapters , but i always do it knowing that i will be rewarded with a great ending christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the who , where and why were finally revealed in the end i was shocked again at the end of this book not because i did n't know who the killer was , but actually because i already knew who and how i tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious very disappointing christie books i would recommend instead abc murders , and then there were none and murder of roger ackroyd
dr northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies , stages of life and medical procedures however , i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced , with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women as a catholic whose best teachers were strong minded , compassionate religious sisters , i felt offended by her slur against nuns i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing , but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research
ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up i first bought the book , 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on , so i bought the audiobook \( 5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on \)
the book is interesting , and well written it contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners
i read this book because my english professor spoke highly of it i would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas so why did your bridge fall down mr engineer \? oh , i dropped my structural steel class so i could do a course in another language i do n't think it 's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person does n't even possess one actually i think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this it might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one this book insulted my intelligence and i would n't even recommend it for a laugh
i have a book of ross' by the same title , but the cover is different \( remake \? \) but most of my problems with his theology come from his advocation of the big bang theory which has numerous scientific problems \( quantized redshifts to name one \) and serious theological implications if the big bang were true , then there were animals before man animals that lived and died the bible says that man 's sin is the reason why we die and suffer if death was around before sin \( for the wages of sin is death \) then what good would jesus' death on the cross have been
i'm sorry , but i expect more out of a book beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric after reading beautiful books such as cold mountain and brideshead revisited , to mention just two , i found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that i knew it would be a plot driven monstrosity that would n't be worth the read at page four i was fed up with the author 's style and slammed the book shut
i was excited to see the book with recipes for the 14 super foods after reading steven pratt 's book , but was very disappointed yes , the recipes do use the 14 super foods , but also use such ingredients as shortening , cheez whiz , and yellow cake mix hardly healthy ! if you are interested in eating good , healthy meals made with the 14 super foods , do n't buy this book
