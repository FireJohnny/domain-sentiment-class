i'm not sure why sony , which now owns i dream of jeannie , decided to colorize the first season of this series whatever the reason , you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on amazon com that the original black and white version of the first season is worth a lot more the reason for that is simple i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in black and white and for a television fan like myself , that 's the only way to watch the first season
if you do n't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection in my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released
denzel washington is great but angelina jolie he is even better the movie itself is pretty scary , to tell you the truth it 's not pleasant there are some parts you do n't really need to see the plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next i recommend watching it with somebody , cause it 's not pretty but it 's a good movie
i rediscovered this after a long time this is a great series i had never seen this in its entirety and look forward to seeing the third and fourth which i understand is not out yet its a gem , love the storyline and costumes , so authentic looking and of the period , even the dialogue i wish there were more of this genre
i bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me i enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also times and styles may have changed , but i believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did simple , but great movie my only regret is that it was n't close captioned

9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling it takes a look at the workplace from a woman 's view
i wanted to do a grad school paper on something i was interested in researching and i picked hip hop after working for an underground hip hop magazine , i 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that i was too young to understand \( being born in '81 \) i visited the university of hip hop in chicago , interviewed underground artists , and went to breaking shows in the illinois area although i thought i was very familiar with hip hop , after working with this magazine , i realized i knew nothing
honestly , i was n't certain about this film , in fact , at first i actually believed it was related to chocolate i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised upon first viewing , i did not laugh as much as the second time yes , i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time second viewing was a belly full of laughter
if you like action , shooting , explosions , fire , pain , torture and revenge , this is a movie you 'll love and , it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role a great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality
he kept it real thats all i can say aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word i just cant help it everybody in the hood cusses but anyways
frankly , the idea of a secret service agent having an affair with the president 's wife is way out there in the first place \( michael douglas not withstanding \) if you like keefer sutherland \( as in tv 's 24 \) you will probably like this movie \( his name could have been jack bower in this flick too i thought it had good action , writing , acting and directing i would not mind seeing keefer and michael teamed up again on the same side i bought the dvd , but then again i collect movies for the actors
i saw this show on pbs and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on i do n't know of any other way to be able to see yul brynner 's commanding king and i performance loved it
i had been aware that once there was a show called mr show , starring bob and david , and that it had been on hbo but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend , when the power of satan um , compelled me to pick up the first two seasons all i gotta say is praise satan for leading me to this glory !
this comedy volume is absolutely great while i'm a fan of the series , i thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next definately do n't watch season 3 before seeing these seasons , because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree it does n't move as fast as some comedy out there , but it all fits together better than most of what is on tv today
i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on \( it 's been some time now \) and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter \( that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon \) a heartbreaking , beautifully acted and must see film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore , and it 's a shame
some classic episodes indeed all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households archie bunker 's old fashioned values were being challenged it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker 's views were organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood \? not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion \? quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone
great movie , great actors for such a sad part of the u s history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed \( especially stonewall jackson \) we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction , but at the end of the day it 's not very important , because the historical interest is preserved
without jessica alba let 's imagine the same film as the deep with jacqueline bisset a real sexy looking woman not a teenager chica lookalike with very poor acting it seems the same director had a better choice in blue crush
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation
see this
i liked this work out it is very easy to follow the instructor , who is very likable , gives good instructions she gives each dance move a fun name , so it is easy to remember i do this work out when i want to work out , but do not have as much energy as usual or i will do it as a warm up to another work out it always puts me in a good mood i liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section if you are looking for a hard core dance fitness work out that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat , this is not for you if you are looking for a fun , easy work out , then this is for you
my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around ! the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great simple music but very creative i signed up for updates on laurie berkner 's website so i can find out when if she ever comes to town so my daughter \( and i , of course \) can go see her she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters , who i do n't care much for i have bought this dvd cd combo for all of my friends who have kids
good introduction to qigong mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful overall relaxing and precise
i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3 where is it \? i hope that it is released soon it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending ! a little unfair to the consumer do n't you think ! it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is is that correct
ohhhh ! i caught this movie on regular tv and even with commercials it was good i bought it so i would get the whole movie i have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family a really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you !
this is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves the storyline is great , but this should have been the last dvd things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over 20 that 's bogus dvds can fit way more episodes on a single disc , and it 's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately the cowboy bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start , then dropped down to 4 now it 's just getting worse at this point i'm starting to regret buying the stand alone complex series instead of renting it i am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out , though throughout the series i think disc 4 was my favorite
of course i enjoy this movie , i ordered it after so many years of searching for it i love salsa music and the dancing

if you sort of like edwin mccain , get this dvd , watch him live , and you will fall in love he has such passion for his music that can only be seen , and felt during live performances his amazing voice , is just as amazing live , and he and his band , can jam ! ! the energy is high , and its a great time !
the much celebrated fourth season of nbc 's long running medical drama , er , is the recipient of two 1997 1998 emmy awards , three 1997 1998 screen actors guild awards , and one 1997 1998 golden globe award
a very successful comedy highly recommendable players are magnificent
i quite enjoyed watching this film , which is why i give it four stars , even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic so , why did i like it \? joan cusack , matt dillon , kevin kline \( in that order \) and also a passably funny script at least one that is well structured for a feel good viewing experience
i'm not big on anime , but watching one episode got me hooked the voices , the animation , the story , the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch samurai champloo
if you are bored with kurosawa 's faithful decpition of historical samurai \( and who would be \? \) , if you think the samurai genre has been overused and outdated then get ready for the hip hop remix version of the age old genre samurai champloo directed by shinichiro watanabe , the man who brought us cowboy bebop and 2 shorts in animatrix , with character design by kazuto nakazawa , kill bill vol 1 fame , we are treated to a world that would have made the wu tang clan feel right at home the action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other one follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play the music is all modern hip hop , no moody asian flare here
i loved this play
the good earth must be considered a milestone movie as yet , there is no dvd but one packed with out takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome there was no oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939 otherwise , the good earth would have 'taken home' that award !
i 've seen this movie on tv a few years ago , but it just would n't leave my mind , so i ordered the dvd
what a cast ! mark wahlberg , reese witherspoon , william l petersen , amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl \( witherspoon \) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend \( wahlberg \) of course , the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance william petersen \( csi \) is outstanding as the witherspoon 's concerned father who has way too many issues himself this film is a hidden gem buy it you will not be disappointed
otto preminger 's exodus is a very well made film this is a big film and director preminger is a master at handling films of this scale he is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature well , that is preminger 's style , straighforward and technically proficient movie making
i got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college good grief since when is a musical ever realistic \? \? especially one that is geared to kids hello \? \? ! ! it 's not supposed to be realistic ! if you expect realism , go elsewhere but if you want to have some fun with a great message not so subtly woven in , then watch this movie kids love it \( mine do along with anyone else i 've talked to \) , and the message is just terrific it 's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes , dislikes , hobbies , etc , no matter what anyone else thinks i love it ! i ca n't even begin to say how much better this is than grease , the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be happy relax with your kids , go get some popcorn , and have some fun with the wildcats kids from highschool musical
my children \( ages 6 and 11 \) absolutely love high school musical my son 's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring , and he 's very excited about trying out for a part i enjoyed watching it as well the musical is set in a fairy tale high school , but what musical is n't a fairy tale \? puppy love and teen rivalry all done in a family friendly disney way walt would have been proud
ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house 8 women , every one of them with their affective lacks , their tribulations little miseries , sorrows and disillusions each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered marcel
this is , as most critics agreed , the best of the trilogy abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish , including a few twists along the way i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd
there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story what did the macho man think about it \? unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth would these be included in a future macho man dvd set \? i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy , especially in front of a huge live audience including kids i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80 's yes , that 's hardcore deadly scary hardcore ! that should not happen in the first place the story involving steamboat is well covered it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing there should be a line which should not be crossed how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head \? human error \? hm nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today 's standard enough is enough we do n't need accidents ! they may be an unevitable part of sports , but not part of entertainment
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70 's show' which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although , you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest woks the way it does billy nighy gives an a list performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly , it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars yes , i prefer pirates over tlotr although , perhaps my comments are premature since at world end has n't even been released yet should that be a dud , then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out
i 'd give 4 stars for this dvd release the movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies to relate the atmosphere of an old 60 's soviet eastern is not easy to an american viewer , and i believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice besides that , it 's a must have , particularly for any russian ex pat
one of john hughes best films , ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him i love this film
i was amased at how very well acted , directed and written this movie was the dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips everyone was well cast it is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo film cliche it transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it 's a gay movie if you hated go fish like i did , you 'll love this movie and go whew for this film it saves our lesbian cinema souls ! buy it ! you wo n't be sorr
leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir , and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in the man who was n't there \( typically , they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember heisenberg 's name \) chain smoking nebbish barber ed crane \( billy bob thornton \) makes the only decisive \( and dishonest \) action of his life , and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several , mostly not so innocent , bystanders in the man who was n't there , the phrase decisive action is an oxymoron everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance everything that happens from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face changes everything forever , and always for the worse set in 1949 in santa rosa , calif \( a tip of the hat to hitchcock and shadow of a doubt , perhaps \? \) the man who was n't there looks perfect like every other coen film , it 's a marvel of production design , and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty black and white look of such classic noirs as double indemnity and out of the past thematically , however , the man who was n't there resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant , much better acted remake of edgar g ulmer 's detour , in which the characters drift in a low rent sartrean hell , totally the victims of fate but whereas detour is more than the sum of its parts , the man who was n't there is less the coen brothers may believe in chance , but on the screen they leave nothing to chance , so that everything in the man who was n't there is too perfect in the end the film has the same overstudied , clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except fargo \( it must be admitted , though , that only one coen film the hudsucker proxy is ruined by that quality \) the acting is as superb as in any coen film thornton in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense , hangdog gravity there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton 's philandering wife doris james gandolfini as her paramour and boss jon polito as a shady businessman michael badalucco as thornton 's motormouth brother in law scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies and especially tony shalhoub , nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider , defense attorney extraordinaire
i was not privy to the world of christopher guest until a friend of mine told me that if i liked `drop dead gorgeous' then i would flip over any of guest 's films the video store only had one in , and that was `best in show' and i'm sooooo glad they had it this film has to be one of the funniest films i 've ever seen , a complete riot from beginning to end as a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the mayflower dog show the film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy there 's jennifer coolidge and patrick crenshaw play leslie and sherri ann ward cabot \( total spoof on the whole anna nicole smith scandal \) , owners of a prize winning poodle who 's won `best in show' 2 years straight , and with the help of lesbian handler christy cummings \( jane lynch \) hopefully she 'll win for a third then there 's harlan pepper \( christopher guest himself \) , a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist and there 's power comic couple eugene levy and catherine o'hara who play the flecks , owners of a terrier , who struggle with mrs flecks long line of previous lovers there are lovers stefan scott \( michael mckean john michael higgins \) who spoil their shih tzu 's and each other but finally we have the star couple of the show , the neurotic meg and hamilton swan \( parker posey michael hitchcock \) , owners of beatrice , and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' weimaraner who 's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex their antics , arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film , and their chemistry is pure brilliance the film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken way to serious , and with fred willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish
a great behind the scenes look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us
next friday was so much better than the first one with much more funnier scenes and this movie is reccommended for everyone
this is a sweet comedy with alot of formula but it works ! sometimes you have to fight for love and it takes something like a movie star moving in on the girl to push you to action predictable but funny is n't love worth fighting for
ferris bueller \( matthew broderick \) is a kind of hero to every high school aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be , really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world , and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye \( alan ruck \) , a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film , ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick day for him , his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick , he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his life is not fair sister jeannie \( jennifer grey \) who suspects something is up , as does the sly but not so slick dean of students , ed rooney \( jeffrey jones \)
highly enjoyable tale of the life of marty maher , the irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become west point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years despite personal tragedies , and through two world wars , maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished army officers' academy , including future legends like omar bradley and dwight d eisenhower tyrone power is excellent and compelling as he portrays maher from young idealist to elderly sage , irish accent intact all the way the scenery and west point pageantry is fun to watch \( although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the military academy \) interestingly , there 's not really all that much football in this film there 's a little , but it 's mainly the story of maher and his family , and the young men he came to love like his own sons with the flame haired maureen o'hara as maher 's irish wife mary , giving a radiant performance sentimental in that '50s way , of course , but the legendary director john ford \( working with a cast made up of many of his favorites \) always puts a bite behind the sweetness
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts i thought , yeah , right but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio it is up to you or you can choose from the basic low , medium , or high intesity workouts this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part i 'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
pbs did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together it covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films the documentary includes many interview pieces with kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like also , there are comments from noted japanese film historian donald richie as a kurosawa fan watching this on pbs when it aired , the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour it is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century
this is a work of genius it is creative , original , funny and well done that being said , it is probably not for everyone
nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even william shatner would envy , and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical as anybody who has seen this show knows , the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for british comedy \( although , as children of the three stooges , americans are , i think , accustomed to somewhat heavier handed comedy \)
i am a huge anime fan , and this is by far the best lemme just say , god i ca n't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan a few hundred years ago , the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct there are people there , even today that report wolf sightings occasionally \)
okay when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago both sets were released by universal fear not , i am here to tell you about the differences the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies like it 's closest cousin the high school reunion collection , the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same movies the breakfast club , sixteen candles and weird science the cover art on the dvd 's is the same , no new bonus material with each film that i detected
one of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel , how they make us react dave , a wonderful ivan reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time kevin kline shines as the president 's sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the the chief executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide the rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully the relationships between dave and the first lady as well as dave and the head secret service man at the white house are especially touching i absolutely love this movie you will too
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act , but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer , presented by material in the film , is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind or even lord of the rings you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh , to gross you out , to surprise you with its clever twists of plot , to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds , and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates' treasures
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing more to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids \? not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , another gloomy but solid \( underrated \) '80s film the worst '80s film is bright lights , big city do n't say i did n't warn you !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we don't have the same taste in movie
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids \( and quite possibly yourself \) entertained during an otherwise hectic holiday i laughed , i cried , \( really , i did \) and i just really enjoyed it
i 'll admit that i'm a johnny come lately to the madea series , finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his alter ego , the opinionated , pistol packing , chain smoking \( never lit , by the way \) madea , have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans , mostly african american , nationwide
inliked the film in the theater and i like the film now the plot does not drag and does not bore
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine , the actors well chosen , the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october or crimson tide whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self sacrifice
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive , honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength , courage , wit and willingness to go up against the big , tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools
this is an excellent movie if you like war flicks it made me angry being from the vietnam generation also it shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men the acting from all the cast was top class i highly recommend this movie it may be slow at first , but the action later is amazing
richard dryfuss and holly hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of a guy named joe full of great flying , laughs with john goodman , and a special appearance of audrey hepburn in her last film you 'll love it
as you can tell from my other reviews , i own a lot of kathy smith dvd 's the reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue ing and instruction she always cues from your point of view , when she says left it 's your left , which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen
i'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand you receive one of the greatest mgm musicals ever conceived and it 's bolstered by quite nice extras that much you can be assured of
i loved this play it provided drama suspense , comedy , inspiration , and great music tyler perry has done it again
i just watched this movie last night i came across the title on someone 's myspace and being a jared leto fan i wanted to watch it i had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting
a deeply emotional film about addiction , love , and family just to some , but when you watch this film you take something with you , something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted , life each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending , really depressing movie but worth a look at least once marlon wayans and jennifer connelly were extremely good but ellen burstyn broke my heart her performance rocked
i teared up when i heard the music from the theme song to the electric company for the first time in 30 years i grew up with this show and now my children are learning from it too thanks to whoever arranged to have it released on dvd it was and still is a great show
i agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say baby einstein videos , however , i still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay my two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although i agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland i love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the dvd my son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days the video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing
according to imdb , moulin rouge was shot in 1 37 , not widescreen therefore you 're not losing that much to view this in 1 33 \( full screen \) format
i really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work i'm a photographer but not this line of work it was an interesting glimpse into their lives i wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries , personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it
one of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves , alaska , and the inuit , i could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it a mid level analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time \( he has his doubts early on \) is chosen to go north to investigate the arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters , including a crazy like a fox entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score , a number of wacky bit players who i can easily imagine were not actors , but the real deal , and every bit as eccentric as they appeared and an endearingly sage old inuit of few words but many eloquent silences

who could ever forget the image of happy go lucky manuel fidello \( spencer tracy \) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle , infectious portuguese accent , yo ho little fish do n't cry do n't cry if you 're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from spencer tracy 's signature movie , `captains courageous' released in '37
after spinal tap , this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown but like st , it is right on these wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it 's satire , it 's real if you hate even the idea of folk music , skip it or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people if you were there i was it 's a real hoot \( enanny \) ! sadly , here in california , they were to be found en masse at every local 99 cents only stores i realize this is not for everyone , but neither was spinal tap give it a try
when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70 's generation you 're talking about paddy chayefsky 's brilliantly written black comedy , `the hospital' which was released in `70
it 's a more vulnerable patton in a white coat , running a hospital , and it 's all great fun , with a good story from an oscar winning script you have to love it when scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow you half expect him to finish her off with there are brave men dying out there !
my favorite dvds are concerts , festivals , unplugged etc i was going to buy the cd and amazon pointed me to their dvd i prefer dvd surround sound to cd stereo plus you get something to look at i heard the demon days songs on the radio , and liked them alot this is an excellent dvd you may want to check out bonnaroo , cross roads , string cheese , even the doobie bros oh yeah and eric burdon and the new animals
season 5 is one of the best of all ! archie and mike are still doing what they do best arguing about anything and everything the best part of the whole season is when archie finds out that the meathead has bought the jedderson 's old house next door arch 's expression is priceless ! ! ! i'f you buy this set u wo n't be sorr
most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone , but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time u2 fan and had seen rattle and hum , but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late 2005 the fact that the music is wonderful is a given , but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage , including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel off stage as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i could n't ask for more
it is a wonderful complement to my lucy collection the tango scene is some of her best physical comedy ! !
the story of a young award winner of a filmmaker 's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get his first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by christopher \( spinal tap \) guest it 's a cynical and hysterical look at how hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis
first of all , i have lost count of the ammount of times i have seen this movie but every time i watch it i get goose bumps this is how affective the movie is
one of the productions of which he is the most proud , robert redford 's all the president's men should be required viewing \( and the woodward bernstein book should be required reading \) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young , untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate break in until it led to the highest office in the united states redford 's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary , so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level , still unsure as to where this would all lead , but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics
peter palmer and leslie parrish are excellent in this fun , politically skewering musical comedy the songs are upbeat fun , especially put em back sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates
lil abner is a delightful comedy musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it 's comic book coloring it 's also superbly cast the film 's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae peter palmer \( who starred in the broadway show \) and leslie parrish but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles \( it 's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway , although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era \) it 's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals , as the dogpatch crowd might say
i saw this movie before i read the books the books are much funnier , and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film still , i liked the film and especially baby sunny i thought jim carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions \( as always \) brought the character to life i think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film , the essence of the story was captured , and is entertaining but i do recommend reading the series before or after watching the film
haunted castle and alien adventure are great , but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of encounter in the third dimension makes it better than the other two the film is an excellent way of showing how 3d started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in , other than the entire movie itself i do wish the mine ride was longer though \( the one which ends with the big , round , stone ball slamming into the tunnel \) and there was more shown of the t3 experience sure , the jules verne journey to the center of the earth ride certainly makes up for it , but the effects in the shorter example were awesome , like the bats best of all , the film does n't look all that dated cgi wise for a 1998 production now i 've definitely got to get the sequel misadventures in 3d dvd noticed something stupid in the credits for encounter instead of saying cassandra peterson as elvira , mistress of the dark , it redundantly reads , elvira as elvira , mistress of the dark unlike the other 3d imax films , this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2d wise of course , the best is 3d since that is the whole point of the story anyway i highly recommend this movie to all 3d collectors
that this film is dedicated to the memory of david maysles should tell you all you need to know about what 's in store along with his brother albert , david maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60 's and 70 's \( gimme shelter , salesman , grey gardens \) , and joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition the story of the poor and semi literate ward brothers is touching and engrossing , despite the squalor in which they lived , and this early 90 's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice absorbing , and worth owning
lets face it woodey allen has produced so much a few of his things sort of slip past some of us i have found this one did for many people
love this dvd so much ! the actors are super , and the story is hilarious !
i was not in a rush to get this , almost forgot i ordered it , so it was a delight when it arrived , thank you very much for a smooth and speedy transaction
the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation it 's hard to even describe really but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in the plot however , is excellent the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers they do what is called committing someone for their sins these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there
this volume gets right to the heart of the plot , and raises important questions who really is gohda \? where is the next refugee threat coming from \? who tried to kill the prime minster , and what roll does he play in the individual eleven \? is there a terrorist virus causing another stand alone complex \? can togusa finds his way clear of criminal charges \? also , we all know the major , but what of her past \?
lady and the trap has been an enduring disney classic for 50 years now and it 's amazing how well it holds up after all that time the hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch this film is an example of disney animation at its classic best
i have been a casual fan of the radio version of prairie home companion for decades , although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time , usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it , and while most critics kind of liked it , there were a few grumbles however , i thought the film was excellent , and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans i liked all the casting , too robert altman is not a favorite director , but when he is good , he is very good , as in m a s h and nashville when he is bad , he is terrible but here , i thought he done good same with garrison k i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review , but i liked him in this
this is the best film i 've seen in perhaps six months or more the direction by turkish italian director ferzan ozpetek is consistently interesting , intriguing , beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually the film is beautifully cut , and the acting , particularly by the fascinating giovanna mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also giovanna , is first rate
this film is a real delight , but it also has a message about our consumer culture do n't miss the deleted scenes i'm sorry the director cut out the saints in the loft in particular what a powerful image ! but it 's there on the dvd so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film
this is a very good , well made dvd which is fulled of idea to prepare dinner for your family
i bought this at \( yep , you guessed it \) the grocery store , which was a very clever marketing concept on martha 's part there was only one dvd left it contained classic recipes for chicken , beef , fish , vegetarian and other main dishes if you think you already know how to make classic , everyday dishes such as meatloaf , think again because martha 's variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one i had n't tried before my family loved it
often overlooked , robert altman 's 'the long goodbye' is arguably one of the films exemplifying the 1970s and , although far less dark , ranks alongside antonioni 's 'the passenger'
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway , i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too for one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! !
wow ! the plane crashes and the story goes on the starnge island the suriviors , the killers , and others who is who before the crash , and who becomes what after the crash
what 's so 'ugly' about this movie \? because it depicts the truth \? to all you parents out there , this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis i know because i was once a teenager too , and this movie hits the mark this is what happens when parent 's do n't have a solid relationship with their kids this movie is not ugly , its just the straight up truth which most people do n't like to recognize it 's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized
i loved gone with the wind this movie lets the lovers of gone with the wind know what happens it is a great ending but set your mind and be aware that the rhett leaves something to be desired and scarlett too but it is a good movie and i love knowing the ending
this is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place the premise is sillier than the first film \( which was pretty silly itself \) , but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense enjoy the ride and try to forget that the lost world ever existed
my girlfriend told me about this movie up until then i have never heard about it this movie was alot better then i thought it would be i enjoyed every minute of it it kept me on my toes the entire time
when i sat down to watch a movie called three woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is shelley duvall , my first reaction was that i would be better off drinking a nice , tall glass of toilet water but , that reaction was short lived it is rare for me to enjoy a movie that i was determined to hate from the first second , but this movie forced me to pull a 180 the ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go it is a trance like movie i found that i could n't stop from watching yet , i didnt know why i was watching very bizzare , and very mezmerizing not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however
9 11 was meticulously planned out by our government if people do not believe me , go read and study that day like it was your babay and you 'll find the truth i was a bit skeptical at first as well now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in this is n't the united states of america , this is the beginning of a new world order do n't believe me , we 'll probably never know , because we 'll be spoonfed our news on the war in iraq by the corporate media that controls and censors what we see and don't see ! do n't think so \? you , along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in iraq by watching cnn \( censored news network \) , or fauxnews it pains me that people still do n't realize that there is no fight for democracy in iraq its a fight for imperial ambitions , we need iraq for oil , and to set up a puppet government so it does n't scare israel , our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of radical muslim fundamentalists no one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself , instead of relying on experts who know what is going on i thought we were intelligent people , us americans \? most of you ca n't even figure out wat the problem really is its our corrupt government
i am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice beautifully filmed excellent performances
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around , but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when mr arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on , for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times , due to my obsession
greetings is an offbeat satire from a very young brian de palma starring an equally young robert de niro the vignettes focus on three friends first there is jon rubin \( de niro \) , an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating peep art this would consist of filming private moments , and then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re creating the peeping tom experience \( more of this in de palma 's much better 1970 film , hi , mom ! \) however , if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film , you are going to be disappointed de niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance , especially in comparison to his two co stars his best moment is off screen as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art \( she repeatedly forgets not to talk \) but he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career , at least until he started making credit card commercials
this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema , and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective , although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later , i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny , but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it
this is a great family movie , a fresh take on enchantment stories it 's rather in the style of e nesbit 's books , using contemporary references i find it far superior to many of disney 's usual works it 's enjoyable for adults and kids
ella of frell \( anne hathaway \) is an unusual child as a baby , a bumbling fairy godmother named lucinda \( vivica a fox \) gave her the gift of obedience every time anyone gives her a direct command , she must obey
get ready for this workout the beginner dvd 's are butt kickers for a 1 2 hour workout the advanced dvd 's are killer i definitely got my money 's worth with this set there 's no excuse not to be in better shape if you have this product
all about the benjamins is a funny movie mike epps is funny the polt of the movie is very interesting and funny i recomend that you watch it soon if you have not seen it yet
the series was always delightful because it was fun , done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek pierce brosnan was great and stephanie zimbalist was a wonderful partner loved 'em both nice to be able to see it again because i enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on tv like it today
once again the saga of motoko kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold as manga , as a pair of feature films , and now a tv series , it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time , a topnotch group of secret agents , and a beautiful woman with a story line that is n't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human , program and soul , get crossed every day
i like pretty much all of annie leibovitz 's photography , and if you have noticed her work on magazine stands you 'll probably enjoy the book too
its original idea challenges us to look in a new way at the things we do n't have the answers for kevin costner is joe darrow , an emergency doctor , who 's pregnant wife emily , also a doctor , dies in a tragic accident in venezuela while he 's in chicago and trying desperately to reunite with her joe does n't find her body and this leaves him haunted his emotional pain is beyond belief , he buries himself in work one day he remembers that emily asked him to check on her paediatric cancer patients and he starts visiting them then unusual things begin to happen the children who have had near death experience have seen emily and are trying to pass a message joe darrow 's already shattered world is now turned completely upside down he is forced to change his beliefs this is dramatic and painful process and its end is a triumph of one of the greatest love stories ever told ! kevin costner 's performance as joe darrow is absolutely brilliant his extraordinary talent shines in this complex and emotionally demanding role !
ok sue me , i love this piece of cheese from the 70 's a remake of sorts of the last man on earth , heston is a doctor who used a expermental sereum on himself after a bio war has wiped out most of the world the people who are left are albinos who ca n't get out in the sun \( i e vampires , as they were in the book \) , and they want heston to die for his crimes \( he is free of the germ and was an army doctor so they blame him for the end of the world heston spends his days tracking them and killing them and his nights whole up fighting off the mutants
sunset boulevard is a drama that reveals the unsightly day to day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense joe gillis \( william holden \) , a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers , holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on sunset boulevard while walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool , he is shocked to discover it 's occupied by old silent film star norma desmond \( gloria swanson \)
this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation
this film is the best film that disney has in it 's live action collection ! every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life i really like all the extras on the disc as well i like seeing how the film was created , looking at deleted scenes , learning about the history of real pirates , and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of walt disney himself
update \( jan 27 , 2006 \)
in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed
i 've seen the pilates infomercials for a while now , but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements when i found this inexpensive for dummies dvd , i decided to give it a try what a workout ! i consider myself to be in moderately good shape , and this workout can definitely be felt ! within the first couple of days i immediately noticed a change in my posture , and a good burn in my abs , hips and thighs i highly recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to pilates
ok even for a guy , i thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth , but to my amazement i thought is was a great story and lived up to all that i have reviewed i would suggest the movie to all
newman , redford , robert shaw as the bad guy , twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so how can anyone not like the sting \? when i saw it on the big screen upon its first release , i did not think it deserved the oscar as best film of its year , although i enjoyed it now , decades later , and after having seen it perhaps 20 times , at least in pieces , i think it one of the best achievements in movie making in its century it has style , and a consistent sensibility , and logic , and on first viewing , it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top i ca n't imagine that anyone over 30 has n't seen it yet , but if that 's you , fix it as soon as possible it is a primer in how to write , direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience newman 's drunken card player on the train with shaw is absolutely classic
hector elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill aside from his superlative work as a doctor on chicago hope he has been often cast as a sideman in films the trusted aide , the sympathetic boss but often in supporting roles in tortilla soup he takes the leading role in a mexican american remake of ang lee 's eat drink man woman
it is the ultima of cgi video game movies i must buy for final fantasy addicts
if you love john waters then you 're already right there with me i would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie grease but is a more self aware film
although subtitled grazia 's island \( grazia is the lead role , magnificently realized by valeria golino \) , respiro could have well been called scenes from rural sicilian life , as the scenography , cinematography and tableaux like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line respiro 's locale is lampedusa , a tiny island far off the west coast of sicily about the same latitude as malta , this place is about as remote as it gets tunisia is closer than palermo it can be safe to say that italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades this is italy of de sica and mascagni , not fellini and prada the men go out to sea , the children play , women pack fish , old black clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky
respiro is one of those italian treasures of a film , this time written and directed by the insightful emanuele crialese , that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story respiro mixes the gut level italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by fellini
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies , though i think the lost world is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies , monster movies , or horror movies should own all three , i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies , but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger , more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two , you will definitely like the third movie
now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004 a relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them
if you are not familiar with research , this nice approach to a scientist 's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies besides , this very interesting and moving film , with high level and homogeneous performances , will show , the closest it can , the early facts about such a terrible disease i strongly recommend it i have seen it with my 16 year old son , but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age a bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience
i 'll make this short and sweet i used to work in spin i did advance , which is creating media events for politicians in other words , for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information
watch this and be inspired by the awesome herbie hancock the recording sessions are great the music and the movie flow along like a terrific jazz solo , riffing on all kinds of themes but herbie brings it together into a whole just watching him play on the piano is a treat if you 're not that familiar with this living jazz legend , check this out and you 'll admire both the man and his music
your milage may vary but i found this movie white knuckle intense and extremely provocative there is little danger of giving away the plot it is not particularly complex three stupid , arrogant american teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from finland to the former ussr , which at the time was very much the ussr and a very bad place for americans they make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate so far so good , but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the russians who mistake them for spies some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving , that i 'll keep a secret for ya i can promise you one thing if you are american , after seeing this , you 'll salute the flag , think real hard before traveling overseas and i 'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border
bruce almighty is a great movie it about a newsreporter , bruce nolan \( jim carrey \) , that has a bad day a work \( gets fired \) and thinks that god is punishing him so god \( morgan freedman \) meets him at a warehouse and tell bruce that he can have all his powers then bruce has fun with the god powers gets his job back , but sometimes its hard to be god you 'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out \)
here is the reason why somebody like bruce cannot be a god simply because the world would suck ! ! ! and his life too it 's a very good movie it shows that people ca n't always have what they want very interesting and unpredictable plot hilarious
excellent , great camera work , very good sound and commentar
the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a well paced and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen
this 2 disc set is packaged in a very nicely made large metal box with room for the other volumes in the series if you feel the need to remove them from the original cardboard packaging \( you 'll lose your otaku status if you do \) the box is well adorned with imagery from the series and is a very good idea and generous from bandai considering that we 'd have bought a normal cardboard box with joy thanks bandai appreciated
in some of fred astaire 's movies there 's only one excellent reason to watch , and that 's to watch fred astaire in you were never lovelier there are three other excellent reasons rita hayworth jerome kern johnny mercer the four of them have concocted a romantic and funny south american fable that features some great dancing by both astaire and hayworth and some memorable songs by kern and mercer
city by the sea is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances , particularly those of robert deniro and frances mcdormand both oscar winners , they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection , they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands james franco , although obviously in to his performance , comes across attempting to repeat his emmy award winning role as james dean the mannerisms , the false bravado , the hurt and pinched face , are trademarks of the late dean , and franco seems to enjoy using them again william forsythe approaches a caricature of his role , but it 's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl anson mount as the moralistic cop dave simond , gives a strong , understated performance , showing that all cops are n't bad george dzundza as deniro 's partner is also good , as is linda emon , as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where deniro confronts her after dzunda 's death apparently at the hands of deniro 's son
rather than menace to society , this movie should be titled , the unfortunate victims of a racist society my heart bleeds for the real world counterparts of these young men , caught up in the unending battle for survival in south central la , and other such areas all around the country
i wanted to see a movie one evening , and it really did n't matter what movie , i just wanted to get out of the house , and get to a theater i looked at the listings and decided to see in good company , and i'm certainly glad i did i found this movie to be very entertaining , and very enjoyable to watch i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well
eddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people i enjoyed watching this movie , and i feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it when it first came out and ten years later it 's still just as funny basic plot ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he 's alone on new year 's night anyone who 's had a bad night day on the job can relate to ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations from the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion , to a gangster 's bratty kids , a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken hollywood people who want to make ted part of their hazardous \( and very gross \) bet i do n't want to give too much away but i will say that i will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever if you love a good , dark comedy this is the movie for you
this set is one of the better jurassic park sets each disk contains a lot of extras , many of which are fun to watch fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the dvds will find this set a great one to have
i loved ben vereen in the show wanted the music for my ipod , too very satisfie
this show undoubtly is one of the greatest around i have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give american 's their own monty python show and they failed because their show is better than monty python their show is not better , it is of equal and noteworthy standing monty python is history that will never been changed they have gone on to do many other creative things bob odenkirk is doing miller lite commercials and i hope he does something like david has with his new appearance in arrested development i can honestly say that this show is not better , yet it is close , to monty pythons flying circus both are great shows
hospitals are inherently spooky scenes of so much pain and death , the very walls soaking up the agony through the years , they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there the hospital in infection \( kansen \) is in particularly bad shape losing money , unable to keep staff , the doctors and nurses working there are under qualified and desperate into this unstable environment comes a strange patient , with a black , infectious rash slowly , the rash spreads , revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human 's body , slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation but all is not as it seems , even then

this is a great film that preceded the onset of the jlo out of sight is a great showcase for jennifer lopez 's talent as an actress it is a shame that she has n't been presented with more great roles , like that of karen sisco , in this film karen is a d a , who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude she has a chance encounter with charming , compulsive bank robber jack foley \( george clooney \) their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would be kidnapping of sisco in her own car it is no surprise that sparks fly however , this does n't downplay the complexities of their star crossed encounter
this was one of the best movies of 1998 , but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience when i try to think of superlatives to desribe it , the one that keeps coming to mind is cool
i did n't think it would be that great and only saw it for joshua jackson , but the plot twists were really good and i enjoyed it a lot and of course , kate hudson , whom i adore , \( even though i did n't pay much attention to her in this one \) but yeah , i really liked the end and this is where i first heard of norman reedus then i saw the boondock saints d this is a good movie and is very underappreciated
wow this movie is outrageous it was a great movie for both ice cube and mike epps they were both great in next friday , so i was ready for this movie i recommend this movie to those who enjoy comedy with their action there is a lot of both here i also recommend friday after next , because ice cube and mike epps are in that as well

i first watched this performance on pbs great performances it is amazing i'm very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on dvd rachel york does a top notch performance in the leading role the rest of the cast is up to par there have been other reviews that say the music is dated , or other such nonsense , but do not pay heed to them premiered in 1948 , the musical is based on the taming of the shrew \( shakespeare \) , and the music and lyrics are done by cole porter sometimes referred to as his masterpiece \( which i agree with \) , the production never drags or disappoints the lyrics are extremely witty \( a trademark of porter \) the music keeps you humming along for days
this show is great the 5th season was considered so so by critics but it is truely halarious see 'the ski lift' for a classic curb episode
happiness can be delicate in just one swoop , it can stolen out from under you , just when you least expect it the results can be often devastating some can never recover the family in the italian film the son 's room has found such happiness , but when tragedy suddenly strikes , they 're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache
this series is awesome , and i am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over it speaks to the depths of the soul of a man having experienced intense pain , though not in war , i find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series this bonding is what men were meant to do , not just in war , but in our every day battles the sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional i recommend this for any group of buddies , or even church groups
very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade
not only does the movie signs offer a wonderfully different kind of alien ufo tale , but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet the story 's true question is this does everything just happen by chance , or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand \? signs is the story of hope lost , faith put aside because of intense pain and grief , and how one man 's relationship with god affects the lives of those around him we were amazed by how truly moving this film is , as well as how humorous it can be , and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast does everything just happen by chance , or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand \?
this movie is obviously not for everyone it 's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour 's nope , instead you get the muscle a cranking huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in this film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart , soul , and body of every other thing in existence in an ever changing world this film is a big orgy of questioning and who does n't like questioning \? this film , in its own right , is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films
she just keeps getting better and better i love this woman , she makes us all look at ourselves and laugh over situations that are hurtful i personally will keep an open mind and try to copy some of her down to earth common sense a lot uf us have let go of for whatever reason way to go girl
one thing about arrested development that i forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years what i found funny last year when i was watching the show is just as consistently funny now in fact , now that i understand the style of humor better , i think the show is even funnier now
this is a great dvd about cage matches it has a lot of violent matches on it and a lot of classic cage matches but the reason why i i am giving this 4 stars is because most of the matches on here are jips \( matches joined in progress \) it would have been better if all the matches were full but on disc 2 it has 7 full matches but that is still no enough matches this dvd is worth a buy but remeber only 7 matches are full
i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years , and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 workouts this video is incredibly challenging , but i like that i can do the level 1 workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd
i am absolutely in love with this movie it 's a real documentary , not a mocumentary , but it is hilarious the special features on the dvd are n't amazing , but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful
in the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from andy griffith in 1957 's a face in the crowd , master director elia kazan gets similarly stellar results from natalie wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920 's kansas in the same year as her maria in west side story , she has never been more affecting then she is here as deanie loomis , the local butcher 's daughter deeply in love with bud stamper , the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero they are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry , but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents
this is the best batman volume yet ! the old robin \( dick grayson \) , travels around the world and becomes nightwing a new robin fights by batman 's side \( tim drake \) , and batgirl is part of the group many villains look different clayface looks more like clay , and bane looks more and act more like a freelance assasin i will now tell you how good each episode is
the back to the future trilogy was excellent the item was in perfect condition and arrived quickly my husband , who owns a delorean , was happy to get the whole story and we have enjoyed watching the old movies
this is my favorite movie i like it all screenplay , director , actors , etc believe it brilliant
whats not to like about ct \? i own this dvd and the audio double cd thats it believe me , thats all you 'll need what really makes it worth it is the commentary a fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the dvd i can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do that humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this dvd a must have !
the boys take the stage on their hometown for a silver anniversary concert and pull out all the stops guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid all the songs are represented here that ct fans expect and are delivered with verve all band members are represented here , and even former bassist jon brandt joins in for his album cuts the dvd offers up a nice selection of extras including rick nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage \( and on stage of course \) cheap trick wails and all is right in the world now for the negatives from this release sound is just okay , after some heavy eq work i was able to get a very good sound from my sony 5 1 system , but camera work is indeed lacking cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position , but that may have been an editing problem all in all i give the performance 5 stars and production 3 stars \( a very generous 3 stars \)
this 1954 musical release is just too good too fun to pass up adam \( howard keel oh my god , what a voice \) needs a wife and zeros in on milly \( jane powell \) to drag back to his oregon territory farm and six unruly brothers the tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge milly makes believers out of them the brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town whoops , they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed in for winter
you know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again ! i pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video best educational video i have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other brainy baby videos try it you wo n't be dissapointed !
this movie may not be for everyone , but to me it 's highly memorable
this definitely is one of the best movies to own ! ! if you have n't seen it yet , you should if you 've seen the movie blood in , blood out , then you should definitely see this one if you have n't seen either one , then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately \( if you want to save \)
an intriging suspense film with a shocking ending the clues are obvious throughout the film , but the viewer is , nevertheless , surprised and possibily amazed alan rickman shines as david weinburg , the social climbing husband his performance shows his versality as an actor for viewers who like suspense dark harbor is a must
this excellent dvd gives us a remarkable version of martin scorsese 's film it has been color corrected by scorsese himself , and remastered for superior sound quality

this continuation of the anne series on screen is very well done , and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did the only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers what it really does is just focus on a few key incidents , and drastically truncates anne 's college and teaching experiences morgan harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of roy gardner , sophy sinclair , old mrs gibson and pauline , and elizabeth this installment ends with anne and gilbert becoming engaged
what a complilation ! much better than what availiable out there on him it was good to see some of the old clips from the sixties of marvin i know that there 's got to be more i especially liked the clip with tammi terrell i was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing that 's the stuff of legends i hope motown continues this series of dvd 's with their other acts
brilliant is an often overworked phrase , but in the case of hamlet starring mel gibson , the word cannot be used enough for brevity 's sake , i will save zeffirelli 's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing this review is for chris devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult shakespeare script devore somehow makes it better were he in london , late 1500 's , he would have been a collaborator , making will 's work the pearl it is today my only plea is that , at some date , we will get to see gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared
harvey milk was the elected supervisor of district 6 in san francisco when he was murdered along with mayor george moscone on november 27 , 1978 , by fellow supervisor , dan white \( who later claimed the infamous twinkie defense \) the film the times of harvey milk firmly places the murder of milk , a gay politician , into the politically significant context of the times the crime , the verdict , and the sentence served were all shocking this film tells the story behind the headlines
the danny boyle directed trainspotting was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades , i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty star robert carlyle , as violent psycho begbie , swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high
calling all black sheeps of the family it is never too late for your family to come around in this simple yet powerful story , april and her mother learn that sometimes , those we have the most conflict with are those who are most like us painful as it seems , we must all come to terms with dissapointment and overcome our personal fears of rejection when revealing our true selves
awesome movie , great for laughs and you do n't have to be high to enjoy it this is n't ghandi or shawshank redemption it 's not supposed to be the best movie ever made but it does give you the laughs , so just keep laughing and stop taking it too serious
an excellent movie about a smart conman who eventually ends up rendering his skills to the fbi
this dvd is explaining things better than the previous version , where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc
i cannot recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie , which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business , that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business , it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world
warning ! this is not for children seeing death , real destruction , and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9 11 is not for the young
this documentary gives a brief introduction to al jazeera , which , if you did n't know already , is the main arab language newschannel it is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it 's willingness to go where other , stated owned and controlled arab networks wo n't tread in this sense it is more than a mere arab cnn in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media
i found this dvd to be well produced and engaging to go along with the powerful content fantastic loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching
this movie will make you laugh , cry , and think it 's definitely a good date movie bring a box of kleenex though
seems like there was a time in the 70s where mainstream filmmakers took their art and their audiences seriously this gem about courtroom corruption is one of pacino 's best movies and his final courtroom monologue is as good as any in film
this has to be the best of the alien films ! this film , although not as scary as the original \( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien \) , it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also , this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on , buy the collector 's edition of the first and this and enjoy
i was a bit skeptical about jogging in my home , but wanted a little boost from the two mile walk i had been doing if you are at all skeptical , don't be ! i have used 4 of leslie 's programs and for me , this one takes the cake it 's fun , it 's fast paced , and it works up an awesome sweat you can feel the calories burning with this one it 's well worth the 10 or so dollars
product was in great condition i got the product quickly and was very satisfied
i woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of fellini satyricon someone is mortally wounded , the blonde guy \? and lies there dying , watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired , gitone , and some dancing leaping black guy i think
this is too good to be true after purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and i sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place for the next three hours , we were absolutely shocked and entertained this has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created its got it all comedy , drama and twisted minds i have to admit i 've taken a few lessons from jill and her methods do work seriously though it was just plain amazing and i hope series two will be out soon it is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the brady bunch the lamest thing ever to grace television for the rest of us , well nighty night highly recommended
gilbert gottfried is a genius thank you for making a dvd that puts so many dirty jokes where they long together ! of course i knew a few , but i learned so many more ! gilbert 's delivery is priceless , and his impressions of comics like bill cosby and jerry seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier
more than male and female more than your view or her view or my view or any one person 's view of what makes male and what makes female and everything in between sexuality \( gay , straight , bi , asexual , etc \) is different than gender \( male female \) and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other
i am not sure why the first person would direct people to read j michael bailey 's work or why the second person would say that it is as if j michael bailey wrote this himself one he could n't have because it is a documentary , and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community and he was forced to resign from northwestern university as the department head , because of his illegal uses of his patient 's information in his book
i have found pick your spot pilates to be absolutely perfect ! i can choose which spot i want to work out for the day or do them all i usually walk first then add a 10 minute pilate workout to wrap it up while my muscles are still warm i would highly recommend this workout video
an excellent comedy , kindergarten cop , brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal what complicates things is that it 's arnold schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher
hard bitten cop john kimble \( arnold schwarzenegger \) gets more than he bargained for when he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to pursue murderous drug dealer cullen crisp \( richard tyson \) while at the same time protecting the man 's young son pitted against a classroom full of rowdy , 6 year old moppets whose monkeyshines try his patience and test his mettle , kimble may have finally met his match in more ways than one
my 3 year old son loved this movie he sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video it was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together , they both had big smiles on their faces the pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams my 3 year old says when i get big i am going to fly blue angel 5 i highly reccomend this video
since i 've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items , i'm not gonna repeat anything about each show \( see individual reviews for that \) i will just rehash what i have all along despite its missing pieces from the book , the original is still 5 star material the in betweener is only worth it 's value because it is a disc copy \( as opposed to a tape copy \) my advice , buy the original separately , and read the book to get the real missing years if you are building a library of all richard chamberlain , then buy both or this combo but be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged missing years has to offer \( again see separate review \)
i found this series to be fun , gritty , and lifelike the characters in the precinct remind me so much of guys i used to work with on the job certainly some artistic license is taken , but for the most part , this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs denis leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian , but a really talented character actor his supporting cast fits well , and all in all i would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of rescue me , or denis leary
a great behind the scenes look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us
this is probably one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen those who do n't think it 's funny are those who are easily offended if you are easily offended or politically correct you probably wo n't enjoy this film
loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries very funny and moving yes , i'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !
one of the many hit tv shows inextricably linked to the 1980 's is the a team , an action series with plenty of bombs , machine guns , and bazookas where miraculously no one ever seems to die ! short for alpha team , the a team is a vietnam era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the bank of hanoi having escaped from a maximum security prison , the four man team survives in the anonymity of the los angeles underground and with the government still hot on their trail , they 're forced to work as soldiers of fortune , providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices
it is nice to see bebe neuwirth in something other than cheers
from the sisyphean \( say what \? \) misadventures of a kind of black laurel and hardy duo \( anthony anderson and lahmard j tate \) who steal an atm machine with no money in it that they ca n't open , to the white dude who thinks he 's black , to cedric the entertainer who thinks that rosa parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus , to sexy and saucy eve who always loves the wrong guy , this is one fine piece of entertainment and ice cube as calvin who owns the shop ai n't so bad himself , although he sure has to frown a lot

bend it like beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls the film sensitively portrays a young indian girl 's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being the film is enjoyable on several levels 1 \) there is the cultural clash between britons of various descent , 2 \) there is the hilarious lesbian mixup , and 3 \) the pure sports film all in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people
the sixth season is the only one i had not seen all of the episodes for when it was on and it does not disappoint \( except for the fact that this is the last season \) florida 's return and the addition of keith brings more to the evans' family home i enjoy watching each episode over and over this is much better tv than what today 's network television has to offer
an absolutely wonderful movie i love it so much that i watch it once a month or so ang lee did an amazing job of emma thompson 's screen play emma thompson won a golden globe award for her efforts just lovely
if playwright tennessee williams 's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller , they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters this is clearly evidenced in this six film , eight disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950 's and early 1960 's , all directed by true filmmaking masters probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now , the best of the set are elia kazan 's a streetcar named desire and john huston 's the night of the iguana the others are kazan 's baby doll , richard brooks' cat on a hot tin roof , jose quintero 's the roman spring of mrs stone and brooks' sweet bird of youth
when i first watched this tv movie , with an unusal turn by lucille ball as a homeless woman , i was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role , and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished bag lady although definitely within the tv movie league , this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy
oh my i love this movie it even makes me cry it 's sexy , cute , and heartwarming yes , it 's a little bit hokey but what musical is n't \? i am so excited to get this ! i love this movie i'm a huge musical fan and i 've been waiting years for this one they must have finally convinced whomever had the rights to release it on dvd i do n't know but i'm really excited ! one hundred million miracles ! i love that philosophy it makes me happy and it 's a miracle that this is finally available get your kids teens to watch it !
this is worth buying just to see
i 've heard it said that if you have n't read the book you 'd be lost in this movie i read the book and it was still a bit confusing ! i like this version of the film with all the extra footage such a fantastic looking picture this was i saw this in the theater when it came out i remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing sting was touted as starring in this film , when in reality he had a supporting role shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band , the police it was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater having said that , sting is actually pretty good in this film he sneers , he wise cracks , he fights , and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo of course , he gets killed in the end oh well
this is one of the best sci fi films from the 70 's not to be missed
although i enjoy pilates and yoga , i need a good workout that makes me sweat boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose but there are times where i prefer to feel the burn at home to that end , one of the best cardio strength dvd workouts i 've found is crunch boot camp training

what do i think of when someone says disney ! \? hmmm kiddy films , girly stuff , princess \( groan , we do n't need more of that ! \) , dreams come true and cheesy \?
as usual with a bruce willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was interesting high tech house and mostly believable small town villains who are the hostage takers the underlying story of the rich dad his swindles detracted from it i think
to have these three classics for this low price is fantastic one film is the 1938 version of the classic christmas carol this one starring reginald owen as a very respectable scrooge if you can refrain from comparing him to alastair sim , you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of scrooge , and it is a fine one owen is truly miserly and wretched , as befits scrooge , and very believable the overall production is wonderful , the only drawback was the casting of terry kilburn as tiny tim way over the top , to the point where he is annoying but all in all , a great version , and ann rutherford as the ghost of christmas past is fascinating
i first saw this as a child during an afternoon movie event at my gradeschool little did i understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting , nor did i appreciate the subtle moral of the film , namely that good guys sometimes do finish first , by the very nature of their untainted goodness
ok , there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3d set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film the plot is pure ham and cheese a whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for dracula , frankenstein , the werewolf of paris , and the mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life \( i told you it was stupid \) before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height if you can accept a movie on the level of a police academy or earnest goes to camp then you should not have a problem with this only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like camp blood this is a masterpiece
this is a warm hearted , sweet story based on the cinderella fairy tale only we have sam , a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake sam carries on a secret email chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school , but she does n't know the identity of her prince charming
warning do not watch this movie if you are hungry ! if you do , within the first 10 minutes , you will pause it , and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either , but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes i adore this movie , it is a heartwarming , hilarious story about a widower retired master chef and his three very different daughters ang lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking the soundtrack is amazing , the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in , so that you can almost smell the food cooking i would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes !
based upon director and writer oliver stone 's own experiences in vietnam , platoon was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict the movie revolves around a young american soldier , pvt chris taylor \( a young charlie sheen \) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty the battle sequences are very gritty , graphic , and realistic taylor serves under the direct leadership of sgt elias grodin \( willem dafoe \) , but both men are under the command of staff sgt bob barnes \( tom berenger \) grodin and barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict , while barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war at its core then , platoon is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil though stone based the film upon his own experiences , there are scenes that have been embellished and the view stone presents is only one view of the war see the film we were soldiers for the opposite view as presented by stone in platoon
this is a very enjoyable and funny movie with a heartwarming ending all michael j fox fans be sure to get this ! there are many good supporting characters such as bridget fonda , woody harrelson , barnard hughes and julie warner
ok , this movied is a favorite having said that , i am less than blown away by this new transfer still looks a bit dull to me it 's a fun set though getting the box was a no brainer am i the only one who 's missing the poster offer \? a sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within well i do n't see it
clueless has been released on dvd before , with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features in 2005 , for its 10th anniversary , paramount finally released a great , if not cheesily named , dvd edition of this 90 's teen comedy classic , with such quotable lines as you 're a virgin who ca n't drive and as if !
this one is a classic not only to the general public but among submarine sailors as well it is considered the greatest of all submarine movies and with good reason almost the entire plot is onboard and underway the tensions that rise from long periods at sea and personality clashes among a large group of strong willed and independently minded men is real it is a must have for the second world war movie buff and submarine movie collectors the acting is superb and perfectly cast in each role the dramatic interaction of the characters will keep this one a classic for ages to come
what can i say \? this is a darn good action adventure flick there 's suspense , guns ammo , mummies , creepy crawly insects , tombs , and all that there is that make an action movie excellent this is one example of good escapism kudos to fraser , weisz , and sommers for exquisitely remaking the original mummy
i love when a blonde , assumed air head , realizes her dreams she even goes far beyond what she thought she wanted she is lovely , funny , smart , honest , and hard working who would n't love her \? so glad this movie was made
any collection that has the lost patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks that movie and boris karloff alone is something to behold but this collection also contains sgt rutlidge which a movie way before its time mary queen of scots , i was n't even aware was a john ford movie the informer another great and cheyene autumn i think this set has a little bit of something for everyone i just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of lost patrol or the original uncut version
if you enjoy movies with random terrorist executions , religious cults , andy kaufman as a mass murdering cop , alien abductions , bizarre sexual anatomies , etc \( do n't we all \? \) , you will love this one alone in its genre
in all her 48 movies , brigitte bardot never catches public imagination with more effect than she does here paradise on earth is just around the corner , she tells us , making the sparks fly off your screen this edition is the new one , by the way , cleaned up in 2000 you will appreciate its fine use of colors

this dvd was a really good buy , even if you are just somewhat into incubus , but if you are a big fan , it 's a must have the home videos and tour of the tour bus and all the music videos and concert footage was great , with great sound quality also , there is a really funny take me to your leader music video it 's a really cool dvd the only thing i did n't like , was the massive song archive the background music was kind of annoying , and you cant just sit and watch through the whole thing , you have to click on different things but good buy anyways incubus rox

yes the movie is great but please tell me about the dvd ! how 's the quality , are there deleted scene 's , any bonus material \? i think there are about 115 reviews about the movie but i would like more info about the dvd itself !
perfect for kids age 3 and up highly recommended not a scary way to teach kids about safety , just helps kids stay smart on the safe side
i love all the rockford file 's and this collection is very good , i cant wait till the third season comes ou
unfortunely this movie was a sleeper in the theatres when it first came out but check out the cast ! jo ann fleet \( thoughtly modern millie \) and robert deniro in a comedy an a comedy it is it 's just pure fun and a great uplifing movie if you have the blues it 's so funny and you wo n't be disappointed , , , i promise
in this set of episodes , the battle city is down to the wire my favorite character , marik \( not yami marik \) is the center of the events most of his character is known in this set it seemed almost if yugi was only a side note for a while even though i dislike dub , this was still good enough for me
this dvd contains the basic techniques of krav maga system the techniques include attacks with hands \( mostly punches with closed fist , but also hammer punches \) , elbows , knees and feet there are some counterattacks and defences also included at the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack , target areas and stance movement as a dvd extra , they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training \( they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future \)
the picture quality is not very good it 's like watching the videos on an old vhs tape taped off of television i 've never seen a dvd in my dvd player look so not digital the selection is okay , the dvd opens playing a small clip of the tears for fears song head over heels even though that video is n't on the set but fear not , two tears for fears videos are here i bought this because i love the level 42 video for something about you , and i figured this was my one shot to get it on dvd buy this if you just must have it , the price is a bit much for such a short little collection , this should really be in the 12 99 or less range
capsule reviewer sam graham \( above \) is one king sized jerk ! tears for fears and swing out sister are two of the best acts that came out of the '80s and they are still going strong today ! the videos on this collection are some of the most obvious , but enjoyable nevertheless it would be nice if amazon would hire somebody to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music , instead of some supposedly hip idiot
this was n't all that funny
'mr smith goes to washington' is a classic frank capra film from '39 starring a stellar cast of some of hollywood 's best from the golden age of cinema it 's not only one of the greatest films of that era , but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of america was something to be proud of , not mocked yes it 's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions , however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us
i find this to be a perfect depiction of small town life being i lived for 11 years in a town quite like this one really enjoyed the movie and the acting i enjoyed most terry moore 's potrayal of betty
so this is the best i have seen from a terrible tradgedy i watched with friends with tears streaming down my face so factual and so sad
eastwood and lee van cleef what a
every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for jack ti jean kerouac ! to actually see most of kerouac 's fellow writer 's and poet 's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated genius that was this brother lowellian is in itself a magnificent production ! i bought this dvd today at a mall in new hampshire and could have bought it for less on amazon com ! just a few minutes ago i did order the dvd jack kerouac king of the beats on amazon com and ca n't wait for its arrival ! if it 's anything like what happened to kerouac \? then it will surely be another masterful production ! after i write this review i am going to watch this dvd again and experience the same chills as i did when initially watching it for the first time ! anyone that is a true fan of kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius ! to hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of kerouac himself is truly awe inspiring ! this production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is jack kerouac
i almost gave up on this one forty minutes in do n't you do that the ending is superb
there are so many reasons to love all things canadian national health insurance for all citizens , the novelist margaret atwood and certainly leonard cohen a group of singers got together to honor cohen by singing his songs nick cave , u2 and bono , kate and anna mcgarrigle , rufus wainwright , martha wainwright , anthony et al added to their performances are footage from many periods of mr cohen 's life , interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well we thus have this documentary that will delight mr cohen 's fans at 72 , mr cohen may have lost a lot of his voice he opines that he never could carry a tune but he has lost none of his brilliant self deprecating humor
i am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies the nobody character is based on trinity but with much more refined terence hill 's nobody has a certain directness and is a much fuller character henry fonda 's career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame if you compare this to his portrayal of wyatt earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him this is much more the fonda that one loves rather than the villian in once upon a time in the west \( itself a great film \) i love showing this to people that have never seen it they usally like it and then i move on the the trinity films
the reason i believe the ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a very personal , unexplainable level you see , the main storyline of the ring is the fact that this video tape has been created , and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual , twisted manner it 's up to a reporter woman named rachel to figure everything out she 's the main character of the film , along with her son
i find this film to be very different to most american films it is very funny in its own way and make you think about the true meaning of money and its relationship to happyness
i grew up watching this movie its a movie i seem to never get bored with paul newman is an awesome actor , and if you are a fan of his , this is a must have in your movie collection ! ! ! !
okay , the only real extras on the dvd is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it 's stars , but warner bros gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of both standard full frame and widescreen versions on one disc ! ! ! this movie is an absolute classic ! ! ! and it 's great to have it on dvd ! ! ! one of the great men in chains films ! ! ! the great cast includes paul newman , george kennedy \( in his oscar winning role ! \) , wayne rogers , strother martin , joe don baker , ralph waite , and many other classic character actors ! ! ! two thumbs up ! ! ! five stars ! ! ! a
being copied from tv the quality came out great good choise of show
given that pornography is a multi jillion dollar a year business , it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed , darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves , and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams , a simple minded , almost impossibly well endowed teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights is both a time tested star is born and almost blows it all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was
it is said that suffering develops character surely , when photographer zana briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in sonagchi , calcutta , in india , she discovered more character , and in smaller shape and size , then she might have imagined peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life into the world of prostitution to capture the images the world wishes not to see , not , at least , from this angle of truth , she saw between the life battered women their children
this is a wonderful story showing the universe can have aliens that are not horrors monsters or disasters for humans and humanity kids or adults can see a picture of aliens , not the usual us in a strange colored costume but folks we cannot see or even recognize as folks strangers with a problem seek help and after receiving help , return the favor
you will be laughing one minute , crying the next , then holding your breath to see what will happen next it 's a great all around movie , good for the whole family
this collection of the first four road pictures is well worth having the picture quality is excellent and all four films are loaded on one double sided disc but where are the remaining three road pictures \? this would have made the ultimate road collection disappointing
i love sub movies this one is one of my favorites good story and good action
most of this season is about topanga and cory breaking up and getting together i think the second season is the best though
just behind wings of desire is federico 's masterpiece
any movie that begins with a civil war ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me \( although my wife thought i have started playing the wrong movie \) then again , it was really upsetting at the film 's climax to see the c s s texas getting shot up yes , i know it is just a film , but the thought of finding such a civil war artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world , which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here
i did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80 's i had seen winds of war , however , and at that time , i loved it now , when i purchased the dvd 's , both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction i particularly have trouble with accepting robert mitchum as a virile , intelligent , sombre , alert and perceptive , about 50 something pug henry i wish some filmmaker \( curtis would be great ! \) would do a remake of this entire project making it into a 4 hour feature movie tightening up the script entirely \( apologies to mr wouk who wrote the teleplay \) mostly keep in the historical scenes but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea and do away with some of the long , soap opera dialogue scenes keep the holocaust part intact these were the most powerful holocaust scenes i 've ever seen and i 've seen most of them but have someone like kevin costner be pug henry \( or harrison ford \) and find a truly young , very vibrant natalie \( an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence \) , and a gorgeous , rather naive rebel leading man to play byron \( briney \) we need to feel their chemistry otherwise , what transpires \( briney 's desperate attempts to find natalie and his son \) seem over wrought and contrives i loved polly bergen as rhoda it might be hard to find anyone better , i think and you 'd need a new hitler one who is more like the actor who played him in winds of war
as with vol 1 , i bought this for my wife , and she is thrilled with it
of course the movie deserves 4 stars , however i wish i could say the same for the dvd what does it take for dvd company to release each dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs \? nothing !
this wonderful tv special from the 70 's is timeless and has great music by harry nihlssen \( not sure of that spelling \) the lesson is all about tolerance with lots of side issues of great value i am thrilled to own this dvd it brought back all kinds of memories for me both the story and especially the music it is a perfect addition to my collection of movies for my grandchildren
though based on a true incident that took place in 1914 , in the midst of a wwi battle among the scots , the french and the germans , christian carrion 's film joyeux noel nonetheless has a dreamlike , other worldly quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about carrion 's telling of this sad , sentimental tale
the documentary , guerrilla the taking of patty hearst is a good , solid look at the bizarre story behind the symbionese liberation army \( the sla \) how the sla formed , what actions crimes they committed , and how the group was finally apprehended the film examines the political climate in 1970s america , and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary sla political rhetoric aside , the sla careened through california on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks but more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the sla , filmmaker michael stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment
certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they do n't make movies like this anymore ! from the instant when the dazzling 3 d artdeco credits appear , we 're onboard for the ride of our lives , actually the lives of hero cary grant \( 1904 86 \) and eva marie saint the plot of this 100 percent attention keeper thickens as its characters sicken notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble james mason \( remember him \? 1909 84 \) and ever dapper leo g carroll \( who later played the ghost in the tv series topper \) superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors the elegant un an aerial shot of ant tiny cary grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands and closeups of mount rushmore , which hitchcock had dreamt of shooting , here becoming a backdrop of life and death drama of the 50 some films of sir hitchcock \( 1899 1980 \) i 'd rate this in the top three , with psycho and rebecca rounding out the bases
as i have found with most baby einstein movies , this one engages my very active 10 month old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy while i know that watching tv too much is unhealthy , she will not even give regular television a second gland \( which i'm glad about \) however , there are times when i need her to be more calm like when i change a diaper , try feeding new foods , and right before and after naps these movies have been lifesavers to me
from the sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that does n't has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence it also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son \( since a don juan son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime \) eventually it shows how the aging parents cannot bare the pain from losing their only son , the only way by which they can pass their genes , so they resort to extreme violence , even if the violence is somewhat spiteful if my son cannot pass my genes , your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason would n't be able to either that 's the subconscious motivation for murder conveyed by the genes
the chemistry of all of the cast members is perfect great ghetto storylines that are still relevant 30 years later
plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense , but it turn out funny because of that , comedy scene here wo n't be as class as the first , but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking , great cast in this set , however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star , so i hoped the third one will be best in the series
the film 's title paragraph 175 refers to the passage in german law forbidding homosexuality paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871 , and as a result , homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail dr magnus hirschfeld , a german jewish doctor , and a pioneer in the study of human sexuality , formed the scientific humanitarian committee with the goal of repealing paragraph 175 in weimar germany of the 1920s , an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals , and berlin became a homosexual eden but once the nazis took power , they enforced anti gays laws with a vengeance according to historian klaus muller , in nazi germany 100 , 000 men were arrested for homosexuality , and approximately 10 , 000 15 , 000 were sent to concentration camps of that number , less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made the film , gently and non intrusively narrated by rupert everett , is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps
ah , chris benoit , one of my all time favorites , which is why i was thrilled when i bought this dvd almost 2 years ago personally , i think the documentary is good and somewhat in depth , i just would 've liked it to be longer but it starts with benoit 's early years growing up in canada , then to japan , then ecw , wcw and finally wwe
this dvd provides benoit 's life story , which i found very interesting i believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection , but it was still pretty great

my wife and i saw love actually when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly yes , richard curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings , but it works and the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars
john ford must have felt very fortunate \( although he would have never have admitted it \) to have had john wayne and henry fonda star in fort apache

this movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to it demonstrates how connected we all are as people , and how seperated we are by only one thing our viewpoints
this movie has it all , especially for baby boomers of the early 1970 's blethyn , as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn 's loyal village friends top off the movie 's touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own

i 've actually been hoping for a live cd release , but i was more than happy with this dvd all the favorites are here \( only a minor gripe with the omission of echo and 11am , and the inclusion of priceless , but that 's just personal preference \) this is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity drive is an unexpected change , but being the most played out song in their lineup , the obscurity is welcome the musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous dvds , and each member gets to show off all their new tricks unlike some other bands , incubus seems to perfectly display each musician 's talents so well with each song , and this for me showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly every song is a highlight on this one my favorites are made for tv movie and sick sad little world
when i first found the broadway lost treasure serier on amazon , i nearly jumped up and down in my seat any broadway clips that i can get a hold of i definitly must get i bought broadway lost treasure i and broadway lost treasures ii together i must say the performances were very good , just because you ca n't call broadway bad the way the performances were put together , however , was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic \( jerry orbach , angela lansbery etc \) some of my favorite people , but i wanted i little bit more background information on the shows and things like that
i bought this as a dvd for home use i wo n't repeat the story as others have done so already i loved the story the plot was well put together and solid the acting was wonderful i have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time i see it i really am enjoying the fun of this film i 'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film it is made to be light with family values of what counts in life tim did an outstanding job as he always does the chasing scenes with tim on all fours becoming a dog the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling it is one of the funniest films i 've seen in a long time as an adult i loved it and would buy it again i'm thrilled to see disney making such terrific and wonderful films it was tastefully done the caged scenes were carefully done no bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the disney films and no i did n't perceive this as a film geared toward small children perhaps pre teens and up would be my guess to demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is it is a wonderful film with a great storyline ! ! corinn
das boot is an epic film that is very well done i loved the suspense and terrific character moments the thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a nazi u boat in the midst of the atlantic during 1941 wwii going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean the three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film
these are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals , people , flowers , water , etc i got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months they are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents , and for afternoons when i need a break to cook dinner she laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals , too the best part of course is the christian music ! these videos are top quality and my daughter loves them she gets bored very quickly with baby einstein
his words to the jury , a petition for strength for them against great odds , for himself against greater odds , for a system sometimes blind to justice , and for the victim of negligence who has no voice , puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'the verdict '
it is a gene kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies , but that 's pretty much where the on the town similarities end it is a surprisingly sharp , cynical story in which the protagonist 's dreams do not initially come true due to life circumstances betty comden and the late adolph green responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of auntie mame , bells are ringing , and what a way to go contribute very witty songs here , including the danubian tri liloquy sung by the guys and dolores gray 's thanks a lot , but no thanks and music is better than words \( delivered with a rich , smooth contralto \) i wish kelly and charisse had danced together \( the omission makes the film appear a bit empty \) , but my favorite numbers are still his garbage can dance through the streets and her sexy sweater and skirt dance with the boxers , baby , you knock me out and i would 've liked the roller skating finale better if it did n't have a big , looming , piece of the singin' in the rain set in the background
it 's so silly how michael moore is criticized purely based on what trashy fox news watchers see on tv they claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble , when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts for free clearly , this man is doing it all for the money
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated it has a great story line and plot although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one i really enjoyed this one has quite a few twists as well
maybe you had to be there maybe the actual film never quite measures up to what has been preserved in the memory of a certain generation and with literary roots in journalistic observations of the blandly benign cameron crowe , maybe it lacks the nerve to truly explore the teenage sex blues with the farcical abandon of its vulgar cousin porky 's
it does tend to lurch , but i give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest the end is not near , it is very , very near and possibly , it has already come and gone
i glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is intellectual because it is made anywhere but the usa in their eyes america can do no right my other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame
samurai champloo has been a great series , and this third dvd has kept that tradition though the last episode was weak , as most recap episodes are , the other three episodes made up for it , and then some around the time this came out , fans of the series were starting to buy the dvd 's more due to the shortage of episodes on adult swim , as the last episode on this dvd is as far as adult swim would broadcast \( they did start to broadcast more shortly after dvd six \) below are my ratings for this dvd and it 's episodes
peirce really suprised me in this movie he was always so pretty in his movies , he showed that he can play dirty an unlikely friendship developes between a regular guy and a hired killer pierce , the hired killer , is getting older and less steady on the trigger , could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience , or that he is close to his retirement years and dose n't have a real friend in this whole stinkin' world because of the business he 's in either way , he 's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water unusual buddy film , but , it works ! enjoy
i could explain to you all about each show but you already know what makes this collection great is the fact as to how it is packaged along with the price you get 5 christmas tv classics in a collectors case along with a 20 song sing a long cd and for 25 bucks that is a deal you ca n't beat that 's roughly 5 bucks a show not including the cd i got this set just so my 5 year old can grow up watching some of the good christmas shows that i did
two years later , the red sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in september thinking it never happened it was a utopian dream , the comfort of the drugged and sleeping
i'm mildly into anime , i only watch the stuff that i really enjoy this is the only series that has really drawn me in usually it 's just movies for me but wolf 's rain is amazing i ca n't wait for volume ii to be released on tuesday ! it contains the final episodes \( 19 30 \)
this anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network , and now is definetly considered a classic alongside cowboy bebop and others this is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people yoko kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect it 's so beautiful and fits the story so well the overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful
this is a very emotional film it induces emotion in the viewer , and for that i give it five stars i'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise , so even though i think it is an excellent film , i will just focus on what i think is wrong with it
i first saw this movie in high school in the theater i was extremely moved by the film , and it triggered a facination with south asia that lasts to this day i even work half the year in sri lanka now so for me , personally , this movie is of tremendous influence
i did n't have high expectations for this movie , but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times i 've always like tom cruise and he does n't disappoint in this movie but the real star is ken watanabe as the samurai leader what perfect casting ! and koyuki as the samurai widow was just plain gorgeous the hd dvd transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better highly recommended
i think this is a beautiful story about a man , who wanted to change his country he was not looking for his lost money , he wanted a new hungary the story about a great man , love through peace , war and blood a great story from the hungarian history everyone , who like dramas , the 19th century , real heros have to see this wonderful movie

i saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre i thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint not even close ! this movie is strange and should someday earn cult status besides i like watching drew barrymore
you go , diva ! ! i missed these videos , soooo cool ! ! deeper than the night , i think my favorite olivia song of all time so young , so beautiful ! ! and even hotter now check out video gold 2 just as incredible rock on , olivia !
their was a whole generation of little girls teenagers and young adults sitting down in the 90 's to watch 90210 and party of five they were even on the same night at one point it was a perfect tv night ! this show is amazing if you havent seen it your missing out and if you have you need to own this dvd ! i'm really surpised that this dvd isnt more popular i really think its because it hasnt been advertised these dvds need a little advertisements just to let the fans that dont search for it know its out thier buy it its worth every penn
on the face of it , a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as niche as you can get , but do n't overlook this film the relationship between harold and maude is truly endearing , and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic through maude \( ruth gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit \) we get a truly unique perspective on life , told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her if you like igby goes down \( a modern interpretation of catcher in the rye \) you 'll get much the same feeling from harold and maude , which is not so much a coming of age movie as a funny but deep look at love in all its splendours
a friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it wow ! our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over we used the dvd along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great before pre school started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 10
the stellar performances of jason alexander \( buzz \) and john glover \( james john \) make this movie , providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film the swan lake scene , while funny , is probably the most sad , as each character explains how he will pass on
this movie is a great movie to add to your dvd collection especially if you are a mob fan this movie is about corruption within the mob , about betrayal , about death and dying it starts off with someone trying to whack the don , and the family trying to find out who it is and why i'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story just watch it mario puzo 's the last don \( 1997 \) was great too
i do n't own this series , but i watch it on pbs it 's great they cover a limited number of words per episode , and i'm grateful it can get a little overwhelming my 2 1 2 year old daughter only does a few signs , but she 's able to decipher anything i sign to her i know mama , hungry , want , cookie for now that will have to do for mama is hungry , she wants a cookie you 'll catch other words from the songs go to the signing time website they have sample videos , and lyrics , you 'll get the idea a little at a time is good enough for me expert proficiency is not my expectation here five stars
i love this series and plan to buy more it is well done the signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting , or watch the whole dvd the word is first shown , then a mom shows the sign , then kids demonstrate \( including some use of the actual object , if appropriate \) my child and i have both picked up signs quickly from this dvd
the bad sleep well is a forgotten gem from one of japan 's great masters , akira kurosawa his other two shakespeare adaptations , throne of blood \( macbeth \) and ran \( king lear \) , are much more famous and well regarded , justifiably so if you have seen them \( ran is particular is my favorite of all kurosawa films \) however , this sharp and caustic adaptation of hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition it may be the most bleak subject matter that kurosawa ever tackled the corruption in the highest levels of government in post war japan
the thomas crown affair gets better everytime i watch it i spot something i missed hear music which i heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie actually hearing the windmills of my mind this is an unbelievably good movie , although i prefer the original 's ending
gosh the other reviewer , who seems to me , only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that oh , and on the dvd covers this is n't the first anime to have 'fan service' on the dvd covers look at kiddy grade , an anime that this tweedledum65 reccommends over r o d tv i'm not going to get into details on this anime , for good reviews check out www themanime org , i'm just saying i liked it , and if you 're paitient , and like a good mystery , i hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do
i ordered this guide so that i could understand all of the options and functions available on my new nikon d200 since it is a video that i could watch , pause , then continue watching it was easy for me to understand the explanations made a lot of sense there are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the d200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos i highly reccommend it
jude is a very powerful film it is also very disturbing , but it is absolutely a must see this is an adaptation of thomas hardy 's last novel , the film is n't exactly like the novel , but if you can ignore that then you 'll find that this is quite a terrific film just do n't expect exactly what you got from the novel over all i give it four stars
i waited years for this movie to be released in the united states as far as i was concerned , it was n't about the acting , as much as it was about the feeling the actors wanted to portray , in which they , profoundly , accomplished
murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a regular don juan to his neighbor winston , a family man
this is one of my favorite movies and i find it unfortunate that not too many people know about it i think it is important for people to know this story everyone should watch this movie simply because it is fantastic
the medium instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005 i usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal , which tuned me in however , it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating patricia arquette who was in ed wood with johnny depp plays alison dubois her emmy win for best actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry , but the on screen chemistry with jake weber who was in meet joe black and plays her husband joe is riveting they fight , spat , try to mask conflict in front of their kids , juggle an impossible number of real life tasks , and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of alison 's psychic ability i found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show , i still wanted to watch them over episodes of csi miami that i had not seen when i bought the dvd , i was hoping there might have been an episode i 'd missed , but i 'd seen them all between nbc lifetime reruns several times i'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing alison 's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together what impresses me about alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing in a world of violence , it 's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points in the episode in sickness adultery her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her as she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife , she finds that her best defense is the truth the two older daughters are also jewels maria lark as bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream , mom , please stop doing that ! sofia vassilieva as the older aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing david cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with arquette miguel sandoval as the district attorney manuel duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show \( perhaps we will sometime see more about his family \) while it 's hard to pick my favorite first season episode , the complex plot of a priest , a doctor medium walk into an execution chamber is a jewel , with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder the dvd commentaries and introduction to the real life alison dubois really give excellent background for fans of the show this is one show that reaches the level of art for me its excellence will make it memorable for a long time this dvd collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection bravo
i was happy to see a 'romantic comedy' that did n't line up with every other formula picture in the genre really fun stuff and some solid acting
this video is amazing ! my 6 week old son is watching it right now ! i ca n't believe how entertained he is by it ! these videos have been proven to increase a child 's iq , so i do n't feel too guilty about letting him watch
while i 've always loved blade runner , the so called theatrical cut was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation harrison ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped but hollywood , in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience 's intelligence and artistic sensitivity , stuck with it anyway , on the assumption that we needed to be spoon fed with sophomoric incompetence
this was an excellent experience my movies arrived very promptly and i have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times everything went well the dvd 's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition ! i will definitely order from here again
i really like this video because of its time \( 30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment 40 min total \) and i like the instructor janice is really good , calm , cues well , doesnt talk a lot , and is not overly inspiring she clearly points out the person who will be doing alternative low impact moves and then continues on there is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn no hard choreography either i use this w a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one i enjoy to return to
an amazing film ! not only is it a fantastic adventure , but the story is well laid out just the right amount of special effects , great music and good actors when seeing this movie at the theater i was not too excited , but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is not nearly as gory as gladiator , but is similar in style 5 out of 5
i have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding robert kennedy , and i 've got to say that this is , by far , one of the best pieces of work i 've yet to see the movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience 's attention , allows for us to actually feel what robert kennedy is feeling , to sense the tension during chaotic times , and most importantly , to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for america
i just finished watching most of it , and it 's not too bad the thing that most struck me is it does n't take very long to see which were the eras for superman that had the most influence on bryan singer he spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get superman started , then we 're quickly through the comics and the kirk alyn eras , then it slows down for a long retrospective of the george reeves years , both in superman and the mole men and the adventures of superman , then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the 50s , 60s and 70s , then stops again for a lengthy study of superman the movie , then briefly about superman ii , superman iii , superman iv the quest for peace and superboy , then briefly on lois clark the new adventures of superman and superman the animated series , and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of smallville , and then it becomes a big commercial for superman returns
saw the names kathy bates , barry manilow and julie andrews , so had to give it a view best film ever best lines in a film ever as well ,
only the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention it 's up to word of mouth to save it and it 's certainly worth saving nobody does the awakening matron like kathy bates \( see fried green tomatoes \) , and her grace beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice she needs it her daughter in law \( meredith eaton \) is an acid tongued dwarf with no inhibitions , and dan ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the johnstown flood after being dumped by her husband , patronized by her son , and deprived of her grandson , grace has no choice but to look after herself grace goes to england to attend the funeral of her idol jonathan pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life and meets his gay lover , rupert everett after swallowing her shock , the unlikely pair returns to chicago to track down pryce 's murderer the performances are all fine , the pace is feathery , the music easy on the ear it 's all whimsical and preposterous , and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you 're sitting home alone the ultimate test of a comedy unconditional love passes the test enjoy it and spread the word
i love this video i get up before anyone else so that i can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long it 's a fantastic meditation , though , that centers me for the entire day ravi singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear ana brett does the poses very clearly , and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses i have already recommended this video to friends
this dvd is a must have for anyone interested in beginning kundalini yoga the moves flow into each other easily and you can go at your own pace this dvd has everything meditation , relaxation , mantras , stretching , wonderful music , beautifully narrated and professionally presented highly recommended ! ! !
office space is a very funny comedy many parts of the film were a delight in the beginning , when everyone is stalled in traffic , i knew the feeling working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons \( ron livingston \) besides having a job he hates , he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is then there is his boss lumbergh an arrogant jerk life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion and demands of his then girlfriend
\( 3 5 5 stars \) listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly , ashen faced with blank stares where is the horror in that \? sounds like a typical sunday afternoon at the mall to me in fact , dawn of the dead \( 1978 \) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film more or less picking up where night of the living dead left off , zombies are on the hunt for prey across pennsylvania four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies they take refuge in a shopping mall , which provides just about everything they need they work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure the walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and do n't bring much in the way of strategy it would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they were n't so tenacious the four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the tv of bombing areas of high zombie concentration they have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere what does fate have in store for them \? the night of the living dead took place , obviously , at night and in the dark , which provided a much more frightening backdrop it was also in black and white , which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make up this is not the case with dawn of the dead , which is in color and takes place during daylight the zombies are people dressed as they normally would , but with their faces painted grey the result is anything but scary tom savini 's effects are hit and miss , though always disgusting nonetheless , this is a decent film that features some above par acting and a decent script the anchor bay divimax dvd is also noteworthy , with a clean transfer and dts sound mix an extra star for the effort
kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular bloodsport and like bloodsport , kickboxer is no doubt a van damme classic there are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences , however the acting suffers worse than bloodsport in that department as for the plot revenge go figure but we do n't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie hey , it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action fortunately , kickboxer delivers it well the movie begins with a couple of good fights right away about 1 2 of the movie is training sequences , but many are enjoyable to watch the final fight is between the villain , tong po \( played by michel qissi \) and kurt sloane \( van damme \) its a rather lenghty fight , about 10 minutes , which is nice above all else , they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on , and yes the result is some blood during the fighting kickboxer is the only martial art movie i know of that used this ancient thai style of fighting \( with the exception of kickboxer 2 and a small scene in ring of fire \) i really enjoyed this i also enjoyed michel qissi he had maybe one line in the movie , but still succeeded in making tong po a great villain , who also will return in the sequal lastly , we ca n't forget to mention the van damme dance napoleon dynamite would be proud also keep an eye out for ong soon han \( main villain in both bloodsport 2 and dragon the bruce lee story \) , who has a short fight against tong po about 1 2 way through the movie
i have trouble saying how much i enjoyed this movie the plot was well worn , but it did n't feel staid or plodding visually , the movie is simply stunning absolutely some of the best visuals i have seen in years the jim henson company outdid themselves this time
maybe you 've heard that it 's all been done before gaiman and mckean prove that wrong with this unique movie it really is something new
i'm another of those who saw this at sundance , and all the things i enjoy about gaiman and mckean 's graphic novels were on display the quiet humor , the intelligence , the delightful weirdness , the astounding visual vocabulary except that in this case , the words are spoken by good actors , and all those visuals get up off their feet and move
i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find
excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda , bono se entrega a su publico , buen sonido , buenas imagenes , magnificos extras lo recomiendo dos horas de u
my hat 's off to sean penn for having the nerve to take this role , and then really committing to the role , he committed way too much though his performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the sydney olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this dvd to the judges dakota fanning is as precious as ever and i hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years \( todd bridges , jill whelan , eve plumb \)
i am sam is superb to the core excellent performances across the board , and an emotionally involving story sean penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged this is a veritable tour de force for him but not to be upstaged is dakota fanning , who plays opposite of penn and is named lucy diamond after the hit beatles song sean penn 's character has to fight for custody of lucy , and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer , played by michelle pfeiffer , for free she helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor all in all , a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness one of my favorites
this , as you may have already read , was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view the live footage is as good as it gets , and the sound is flawless to boot this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers every song is a favorite of mine , and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet the bonus features are splendid as well if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about 1 2 of your day probably , there 's that much on here just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs , brandon recording warning \( a lot of this song is a capella \) , and incubus showing how funny they really are the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this , which is pretty humerous
this is without a doubt the dvd to own if you wanna see how 5 1 should sound and how digital video should look if you own an hd tv and have a 5 1 system you must have this the crowd has been minimalized whoever directed this did a fantastic job , you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there \( glass , sounds great \) this is the best concert dvd out right no
i have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie most comments are so ridiculous , that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good well i hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others the movie was full packed with action the 2 t rex's attacking the man in the car , is just one of the many great scenes , the stegosaurus attack , was so good , the raptors scenes kept me attached to my seat , scenes on the cliff were so good , dinosours loosed all over the island was very intense t rex on the san diego , one of the favorite sequences for many people my favorite sequences were on the island though the movie is intense and full of action excellent sequel if not better maybe some people have not noticed but on this page you can find that the movie was a total success on the whole world whether you like it or not , it made 614 millions world wide on the other side , the movie was nominate for
hello vietnam , and greetings ! , says bruno kirby as lt steven hauk in one scene of this film it was this scene where he filled in for radio personality adrian cronauer \( robin williams \) who was on reportedly on special assignment adrian arrives in vietnam from america via aircraft at first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the vietnam radio airwaves but they discover that adrian 's brand of humor is outrageous , very much like howard stern in real life they also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing hey , this was \( set in \) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with the beatles and the rolling stones from the united kingdom when adrian and lt hauk first met , the lieutenant told adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself when the lieutenant first heard adrian on the air , the lieutenant was not pleased at all with adrian 's stint you oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music' , not wild stuff , lt hauk told adrian in a meeting the 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like andy williams , perry como , mantovani , jim nabors , lawrence welk , frank sinatra and percy faith would bob dylan be out of line \? , adrian asks lt hauk and the lieutenant replies , way , way , way out of line ! adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in vietnam and they hoped that adrian would permanently do his morning show there the brass decides to suspend adrian , bringing heartbreak to fans when lt hauk did his stint , many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted adrian back on the air one listener said in a letter , captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man 's balls another wrote to lt hauk , you suck , eat a bag of s t ! so adrian is back on the air but not for long because sgt dickerson \( the late j t walsh \) , the top man of the brass , demanded that adrian be cancelled sgt dickerson 's superior loves adrian and even demanded his reinstatement sgt dickerson is transferred to guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant 's abusive attitude the title of this film is how adrian began his morning show on the very last show done by adrian 's friend lt ed garlick \( forrest whittaker \) , ed began the show saying , good morning , vietnam , just like adrian ed tells listeners about adrian 's departure from vietnam we hear adrian saying , goodbye , vietnam in a pre recorded message adrian also left vietnam because of his association with a criminal who 's the brother of a vietnamese woman adrian befriended other funny scenes include adrian teaching the vietnamese how to use profanity , adrian doing a parody of the late richard m nixon on the air and adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield this film was a megahit for both williams and director barry levinson they were both at least nominated for academy awards levinson did win a best director oscar for his next film , rain man this film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like three men and a baby both films were made by touchstone pictures , a division of buena vista pictures three men and a baby was a megahit as well both films were still in theatres by spring 1988 three men and a baby inspired a sequel , why did n't gmv \? obviously nobody had any ideas , not even mitch markowitz who composed the screenplay
i remember seeing this film when i was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling i did n't know what the name of this movie was and i was looking for it in the video stores i stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that i saw 20 years ago , i bought it after seeing it again , this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago though , by today 's standards , this movie is rather cheap and cheesy , it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling this movie is original , having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings , that eats people like birds eat worms this movie is a hybrid of godzilla and slasher flicks this is definately b movie material , but it 's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories and that is worth more than the price of admission
i bought this for my husband , because i knew he liked seven samurai he was delighted with the gift , and i was surprised to find that i really like these movies too they are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch
the greatest show ever to hit t v you will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great , it always keeps you guessing and wanting more c t u \( counter terrorist unit \) and c t u operative jack bauer \( keifer sutherland \) try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time what i like about this show is that keifer sutherlands character jack bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against c t u or the president another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show , so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more you still reading , stop and go buy the first season right now hell , buy all 4 right now thats how good it is

tim burton 's ed wood , a surreal bio pic is one of the most entertaining , inspiring , and funny bio pics i 've seen no wonder really since it 's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio pic writers scott alexander larry karaszewski \( who , after this film , would pen the larry flynt bio pic the people vs larry flynt and the andy kaufman bio pic man on the moon \) it 's also got an amazing cast of actors , including oscar nominee johnny depp \( best actor , 'finding neverland' \) , oscar winner martin landau \( best supporting actor , 'ed wood' \) , sarah jessica parker \( 'failure to launch' \) , patricia arquette \( 'true romance' \) , jeffrey jones \( 'deadwood' \) , and oscar nominee bill murray
what can i say the humbler kinda says it all just watch him play
this movie sounded stupid when i first heard about it who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense \? obviously , ice cube could this movie stars lisaraye in her film debut as diana , who is known to the stripping world as diamond , a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school while working at a shoe store , she meets trixie \( adele givens \) and ronnie \( chrystale wilson \) they convince her into quitting her low paying job and working at the player 's club , a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named dollar bill \( bernie mac \) when diana 's cousin ebony \( monica calhoun \) comes into town , she tells diana that she wants to work at the player 's club ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of using what you 've got to get what you want this movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie featured in the movie are jamix foxx , a j johnson , and john amos the plot is perfect and the script is well written this movie has to be one of my favorite
i do n't think so , be it in the jungle , a new york high rise or at sea hepburn tracy were great , no argument but they were so modern urbane , not rowdy sexy , always fighting like harlow gable china seas is a fine example of this chemistry yeah , its a pretty good story too gable is capt gaskell , skipper of a passenger merchant ship running from hong kong to singapore harlow is the floozie , dolly , he had a fling with on shore the ship is carrying gold there is a terrific typhoon , a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while they torture the captain , but he does n't reveal where the gold is dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman , wallace berry , against the captain because she is mad at him she of course changes her mind the captain is trying to ditch dolly thinks he 's meant for lady sybil , played by rosalind russell , an old flame but he dolly really are in love unfortunately the collaborations between harlow gable was cut short at five movies with harlow untimely early death several years later

i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister , over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head , or when she accidently dyed her hair green , or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie , with gorgeous scenery , unforgettable characters , and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
it 's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was 3 , and it was played on cartoon network , they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they do n't play it anymore , i 've bought seasons 1 and 2 i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse
marc singer is a bloke from england who moved to new york city , saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets , and became friends with them they in turn trusted him , accepted him as one of their own , and showed him their secret living quarters deep underground in abandoned train tunnels , the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets intelligent and resourceful , they had hooked up to free electricity and had working tv 's and stoves
another reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film i 'll second that opinion
this comedy starring \( martin short \) , and \( kurt russell \) is pretty funny when i first watched it , i was n't really impressed with it , but now i find it pretty funny i think that \( kurt russell \) , as captain ron was pretty funny however , it was the antics of \( martin short \) , who hires captain ron to sail his ship in the caribbean , that was the funniest character in the film the story begins when a relative of \( short \) dies , leaving him a ship , which is moored at a small caribbean island the wife \( mary kay place \) who is not too pleased at going to the island , decides to go along with this mid life crises of \( short \) on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat

awesome college movie my only regret is that i did not see this movie during my college years alas , they have the dvd now !
based on the early movie cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters , george lucas created something special a re invention of the entire adventure genre these films waited a long time to make their bow on dvd , much too long for myself , personally i always loved these films , they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time each of the three films is very different from the others raiders of the lost ark , the first and best of the three , introduces us to indiana jones , perhaps lucas 's greatest creation premiering in 1981 , this film was a smash , also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture also starring was karen allen , perhaps the most even matched female co star for harrisan ford it seemed she could give as good she got , and never backed down in any scene second was the temple of doom , easily the darkest of the three , and the most intensely exciting this film is a non stop thrill ride from start to finish , and does n't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor the third film , the last crusade , is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor , and has the wonderful sean connery to steal every scene he 's in the interaction between indy and mr jones is wonderful if anyone was to ever play indiana jones' father , it was sean connery the forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features , which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves these films waited far too long to be released to dvd , and i lay the blame squarely on george lucas i 've heard he really did n't think dvd would take off like it did , that it was just a phase it 's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy as with his star wars trilogy , the indiana jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all dvd collections
i saw this on pbs' great performances this documentary is about film genius akira kurosawa the documentary charts akira kurosawa 's early life in pre wwii japan to the end of his life kurosawa brought japanese cinema to a world wide audience i recommend this dvd for anyone who is a akira kurosawa fan plus the dvd has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the pbs program and kurosawa filmography
dietrich bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey his books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues , but practical issues of the greatest moment there is a great line in kierkegaard , in the preface to the sickness unto death , where he writes everything essentially christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed even if only medical experts understand it , it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person what gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them , as he struggled to live out the implications of christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so
bonhoeffer was a very informative , very interesting video i first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor i watched the portion that pbs showed , and i wanted to see more , so i bought the dvd i am glad that i did
love this dvd i loved the live performance at the mtv awards
on hearing that warner bros was to issue a set of busby berkeley films , i ensured my dvd player was rendered region free and then i waited it was a dream finally come true having been entranced by berkeley 's films since childhood i could hardly wait for the box to arrive oh joy ! the quality of the dvds is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed , if some of these extras are not to one 's taste , then fair enough , but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature
this is a great video collection of her past videos i love it from the sweet 'i wanna love you forever' to the record label controlled image of 'irrisistible' and 'a little bit' i love the 'a little bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop but overall this dvd is awesome i like the footage from the dream chaser tour and the biography stuff this is the best dvd before jennifer lopez 's the reel me
look at my review for the movie soundtrack i had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie , but my mom sold it i hate that fact , but there is n't a thing i can do about it i wish i could get one back
this is the kind of movie i used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see , oh , about once every 10 years or so an incredibly interesting , odd , provocative movie , that does n't insult its audience the acting is phenomenal , the script is really interesting , and the characters are not people you 've seen 1000 times before although it 's sort of about baseball , it 's not a baseball movie it 's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this i loved this movie
videodriome is a movie i 've been a fan of for years i use the movie as a test to see if people are real movie and horror fans and not just posers the best part of the film is that any day now fox will greenlight a reality tv show where twenty somethings are killed in front of a live studio audience if you 're new to the work of david croneburg check this out asap and see what all the fuss is about the criterion dvd is stacked with extras and the transfer is a thing of beauty
yes , i thought the whoppi disclaimers were absurd \( how many generations have grown up with these cartoons , and now all of a sudden they 're bad \? \) i never saw disclaimers on cbs when i watched these cartoons on saturday mornings for years and years ! ! !
i grew up in hannibal mo , so i am very familiar with mark twain 's writing and his humor the make up is great as holbrook even looks like twain holbrook is a great story teller , and he uses the material well , and makes it wa wonderful program i saw a perfomance live in nyc years ago , and another one in my current home town each time i see it again , it is still funny and a great performance
visconti 's film is significantly different from mann 's classic story aside from the obvious changes \( aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer , etc \) , there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character for example in the book , aschenbach 's wife is dead , and his daughter is grown up and married away in the film , his daughter dies in childhood , and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits venice
i first viewed this film with a friend , in my home he and i are both lovers of beautiful music and art this film satisfies both categories the score is absolutely magnificent and the views of venice , beautiful the acting \( by main character dirk bogard \) is subtle but effective we found this film to be a totally soul satisfying experience
excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an f b i
liam neeson was wonderful to watch a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots however , patricia arquette was too teenage giggly not a terrific actress in this film , at least still , a great role for neeson
one of the best movies i 've seen in ages ! ! ! most movies put me to sleep , i stayed awake the entire time action , suspense , great flick !
upon watching the movie sick , i came to an all out conclusion of all other movies i had seen in the past they will never compare to bob flanagans true life experience of living beyond the expected life span of a human with cf this man truly took his illness by the balls and showed the viewer that pain can be an issue that is manipulated in an entirely different way i found it very interesting how bob chose to be a slave to the woman he loves rather than a slave to his miserable disease those who dare watch as bob experiences life through the vice of pain those with weak stomaches , beware
great plot ! a crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs a good hearted man named dave who thinks about others , and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while two of the presidents regular staff try to get dave to do things that is contrary to dave 's character so the story goes on from there who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the white house this dvd picture was good and clear , the sound was great , and the case was in excellent condition if you like warm hearted type movies , then this is the one for you i know i have enjoyed it over and over to me , dave is about character , good or bad , and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us
i was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses but then i saw the ending , and it was a beautiful one it always makes me happy to see love onscreen
my review of the village mentions the sixth sense more than it does the village , so here it is
i have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2 i ordered seasons 1 2 and they love it every night we turn daniel boone on before bedtime and we do n't have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show i hope they put out the next 4 seasons
i thought this was a wonderful dvd because of the following factors
denzel washington plays the legendary steve biko in this late 80 's film , while kevin kline plays a top journalist who befriends washington 's character in south africa denzel is my favorite actor , and although he does n't get a lot of screen time , this is one of his strongest roles ever \( and you know that 's saying a lot \) not only does he nail down the african accent , but he portray 's biko 's renown concern and persistence
i have heard both arrau and richter playing liszt 's b minor sonata and i am afraid i very much prefer the way yundi li had played this piece perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as arrau 's technique was always not that impressive
li is no heavy weight pianist neither is bunin or even zimerman and do n't foeget that chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all and judging from the steam and progess li has made , lang lang 's position is certainly under threat and any viewer who is interested in li or how chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this here we have to thank martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the chopin competition now in his mid twenties , and musically out of almost nowhere , li is already a full fledged musician
i thought beavis and butthead changed america their stupidity was a influence of a generation i , sadly , was not allowed to watch the show when it was on tv \( i was a child and in my elementary school years at the time \) , and because i actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode \( just like the duo themselves , they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and i do n't care for music videos \) , i really love the show however , like other people who also liked the show , i have to agree with them to release all of the episodes \( for goodness sake ! i ca n't believe they did n't put in the customers suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one i have ever seen when the show was on tv \) because we want to see and have all of the episodes , not just 80 of them and never get to see the other ones i guess this is still recommended but remember , we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back \( even if they have a lost episodes collection i do n't care , the people want them and mike judge is refusing to give us them !
this amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability the combination of puppets and live action works really well , david bowie is wonderful , and , all in all , it 's a great family film when i gave it to my two granddaughters , ages 8 and 4 , they watched it wide eyed and a little bit scared but then they watched it at least once a day for the next week
the professional reviewer missed the main point of jeffrey 's dilemma he 's not so afraid of getting aids he 's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it most people figure a 50 chance of dying before their spouse but taking on a person with a known , fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate , poignant situation
this movie was alright i give it five stars for being artsy , quirky
this dvd was more challenging than i thought , but within a few short weeks i can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different , so i guess that means the programs really work haha \) overall i have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available i easily recommend this dvd
i truly love this film and it 's one of my top favorite film of all time the cinematography is absolutely beautiful if you enjoy violence , beauitful scenery of brazil , a great gang drug related story this film is absolutely brillant
i first bought the dvd for my mother for christmas she let me borrow it i am glad that i finally watched it it is a truly great movie it is a funny movie and very entertaining i suggest either renting it or buying it
i really enjoyed this movie rose mcgowan did a great job as the villianess debbie my favorite line from the movie it 's a family thing the movie was , in my opinion , a black comedy and rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school brilliant ! you should definately watch this movie when you have n't got anything better to do
ever wonder where col kurtz would 've ended up if he had survived the end of apocalypse now \? well , now we know he exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals the horror , the horror
i bought this dvd because it was listed as an imax title , but it is also 3d if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer \( regular 3d glasses dont work with this title \) the quality of the graphics are terrific , the plot is a little strange , but basically its aliens who invade and ride 4 virtual roller coasters at a futuristic theme park the rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique my kids love this dvd , and its worth the price !
casts were chosen by the author hemingway himself that short comment on this film opening was really the miracle particularly gary cooper as american dynamiter roberto and ingrid bergman as hapless young girl maria could happen only through the number of miracles
i never bought the vhs tape , but when i was notified this would be coming out on dvd , i ordered it while i'm not an amateur , i am a professional , eric is a guitarist 's guitarist anyone who thinks he do n't need learnin' is a fool and only famous in his own little world , small as it may be i'm not that arrogant
sea of love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller , but it did n't really bowl me over pacino 's very good , of course , and ellen barkin more than holds her own against him , but pacino 's character can become tiresome after a while , and what i regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic i'm not saying the mystery is predictable it 's just not that shocking of a surprise
film noir at it 's best lies , betrayal , deception , sexual eroticism all through the movie you dont know who to cheer for , the cop , the dirty teacher , the trailer trash chic , the funny lawyer , the school tramp , the tramp 's mother , the cop 's partner , the tramp 's mother cuban lover you dont know who is who and what is up or down one big dirty camp of a movie to describe it with only one word it would be yummy
there are so many reasons to like wild things it 's easy to call this movie perfect although it 's not the best movie ever made \( or even in the top 20 for that matter \) it truly is a perfect movie for what it could 've been i borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it , it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity well , this movie does have a plot and it 's quite complicated some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes , but you ca n't argue that this is a damned good movie matt dillon stars as sam lombardo , a guidance counselor at blue bay high school lombardo is a lady 's man , in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he 's done half of blue bay well , lombardo has a student named kelly van ryan \( denise richards , who i 've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie \) who seems to be coming onto him lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in blue bay well , one day kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash lombardo 's car for the senior car wash and then we see kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face then , kelly says lombardo raped her lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer \( bill murray \) well , then another girl named suzie toller \( neve campbell \) says lombardo raped her as well another player in the plot is ray duquette \( kevin bacon \) , the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories now , this movie is one of those films where you think you know what 's going on and then they throw a wild card after that , you think you know what 's going on again and then s it happens even when the movie ends , you do n't know the full story until the credit sequence the sex scenes \( the most famous with denise richards , matt dillon , and neve campebell \) are quite nice , but surprisingly the movie would be good without them this is a really great movie and worth the 5 bucks it would cost to buy it
first off i agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie when denise richards sees matt dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like , is this just a game for the boys , or can anyone play \? she looks so sweet and hot that it 's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later however she pulls ift off pretty well in fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well i could n't understand why kevin bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual , but that was actually pretty good acting i ca n't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists , but it 's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing
this movie looks simply amazing ! the color , texture and detail provided by hd dvd are superb , this is a showcase title for the format first a word about my setup , which is nice but far from optimal the hd dvd player is connected via hdmi to a sanyo pl z4 projector , with an approximately 140 picture thrown onto a light beige wall the room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado 's but my family and i thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it
an extraordinary film , the vanishing , brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest
a great reality show , following a group of working class youths in england getting the chance to become cooks in a top uk restaurant for free it 's highly entertaining and well worth the price we caught this show when we were visiting australia and got hooked also check out jamie 's school dinners series , available on amazon uk
i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well i think the remake is incredible is it better than the original \? in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie now if he can pull that off \)
the premier american cinematic drama is the western , and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns this set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot , every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side there are n't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections
the first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of usmc boot camp i have ever seen , outside of actually being there i 've read that r lee emery , who played the senior drill instructor , was initially hired to coach other actors for the role but he did such a perfect job himself that stanley kubrick hired him for the job if the film had ended after the first half alone , it would have been phenomenal
i enjoyed the movie very much since i love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as merrick says when men still had honor , i wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime besides i'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs , even if it mea n't changing history i liked that they portayed lady clair as a tough , stand up to the bad guy , do what needed to be done , spy for her brother to win the battle , kinda lady
this is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s it 's an updated version on an old theme save the young heroine from the evil , blood sucking vampire
this dvd kick starts the longest running animated prime time show ever the first season was an experiement to the show there are many solid episodes in this 13 episode season like bart the general , call of the simpsons , krusty gets busted and some enchanted evening
this is one of my favorite movies of all time having it on dvd so i can select a scene just makes it better the only complaint i have is that there are no subtitles available \( at far as i can tell \) otherwise it 's great a faithful rendition of a classic story i think jane austen would be pleased
see how the creative process works when making the world 's best selling album ever great insight on the a band coming together as one interviews are great
ok , i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo
three stooges meet waiting for godot lurie , waits and benigni turn in great performances they 've been locked up in a lousiana penitentiary for being in the wrong place at the wrong time jarmusch gives you each of their sordid lives in turn before throwing them together in a jail cell benigni plays wonderfully off lurie and waits , culminating in a hilarious version of i scream , you scream , we all scream for ice scream eventually , they find the light at the end of a tunnel , only to have to escape through a swamp jarmusch gives his characters plenty of room , making for many amusing interchanges jarmusch provides deft camera work and his usual wonderful eye for detail to make this his most memorable film
okay , how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants \? unless you were one of the misery causing bee otches , you did n't this movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena , but takes a good crackshot at the mothers \( kirstie alley 's character is a real gem ! \) it also makes fun of the people in minnesota i see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film , but heard the term midwest used far more often we feel your pain , but i would have laughed had they picked my state \( which is very close to mn \) they poke fun at hunters , lutherans \( yes , i'm one \) , and lutefisk for lunch in high school \( i'm also of norwegian decent \)
art history has always been an interest of mine , and i'm a big fan of other art movies such as girl with a pearl earing and merchant of venice so when i found out about modigliani i was happy to take the time to go watch it not only was it worth my time , but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion was n't looked fondly on
i have both madonna grimes workouts dvd 's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts it was a great way to start my day , i was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same , but with disapointment comes satisfaction the other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts , and learn a workout that i never thought that i would learn and enjoy doing jayna 's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning , also great moves you can use for other reasons rania 's upper body is really fun , some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot suhaila workout i am intimidated by i have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it i have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks she can contract them one at a time some mornings i get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape they are really fun this tape has a bonus yoga , i had never tried yoga and this gave me an opportunity to try it
wm 2000 had 2 great matches witch were the trangle ladder match and the fatal 4 way match for the wwe championship wm 17s best matches were chris benoit vs kurt angle , vince mchmahn vs shane mchmahn in a street fight , the tlc match , undertaker vs hhh , and the main event the rock vs stone cold for the wwe championship match of the night for wm 18 was the rock vs hulk hogan wm 19 had 4 great matches and they were shawn michels vs chris jherico , hulk hogan vs vince mchmahn in a street fight , the rock vs stone cold , and brock lesner vs kurt angle for the wwe championship and wm 20s best matches were eddie guerro vs kurt angle and chris benoit vs shawn michels vs hhh buy this ! ! !
i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times , almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before
the movie was great ! ! but they left a few things out in the movie that were in the book ! ! there were more siblings in the book but this is still a must see and must read !
love the book could n't wait for the movie and was not disappointed ! i have watched it many times , and enjoy it each time the story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event , which is why it took two dvds or 3 cds \( yes i have both \) to show the entire story a great way to spend a cold , winter day
this is one of the best photography documentary i have ever seen i love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets i love the story narration that this dvd succeeds in james nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal you can feel the pain , agony and raw human emotion in his photographs he is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger it needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed
the seventh season was the season that got me hooked to south park specifically episode number 712 all about the mormons that was the first episode that got me into the show , and i have n't stopped watching since the season list includes the following
absolutely brilliant ! if you are a south park fan , this has got to be added to your collection matt and trey have lost none of their wit and i ca n't wait until the eigth season is released ! i had to purchase it from the usa \( i live in england \) as it 's not yet available over here and it actually cost less to buy and have it shipped over than it was to buy the previous six seasons in the shops
i really enjoyed this dvd it was sent through the postal system in very guickly thanks
if your not already hooked on the story of these interns you have some catching up to do its not your typical medical drama and certainly worth watching
movie was pretty good coming of life story about a boy from jersey trying to make it as a bartender in the hottest club in the city addresses teen issues such as , drug abuse , sex , betrayal , jealously and family
i owned this movie in full screen on vhs the quality of the transfer of apollo 13 with the wide screen and the incredible clearity 0f hd that was never possible before , makes this movie a true cinematic experience one of tom hanks' best movies !
great movie ! make it part of your collection good story , beautiful video and great sound turn your volume up on the blast off and you will feel the power !
this movie is a real departure for the director , akira kurosawa , in that it blends his humanistic inspirational type movies , like ikiru with a bit of action and drama yojimbo , sanjuro the majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of japan under a domineering senior doctor naturally , everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour midway through the movie , out of nowhere , one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission it is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief , confusing , and brutal toshiro mifune and kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director 's work changed radically still good , but i 'll always prefer the b w epics the two of them made together
ahh remincing about the old days of youth this dvd is great for the young and the old w comedy that surpasses all generation its a great gift
i bought this only because i loved the first one , hoping it was n't as terrible as the second after i watched it i was so impressed first of all i loved that it really did n't have anything to do with the first , aside from cassidy being katherine 's cousin , and sharing the same last name \( there is only one reference to katherine and sebastian in the beginning \) it is much better than having different actors playing old characters , which drags a movie down alot i thought the story was great , with good twists the whole cast is very attractive , which ca n't hurt either the bad characters are all pretty likeable , aside from one , and all is well in the end the best thing about this movie is the character cassidy i sarted out hating her , and ended up really liking her for her realness , and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b tch this actress does a particularly good job , pulling off both loveable , and complete brat at the same time i would definetly reccomend this movie
goal ! is a well done soccer version of the road to glory in athletics it is a true cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom
i ca n't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars i do n't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews , but this is certainly not a bad movie i was in 7th grade when it came out and i remember how popular it was back then everyone , and i mean everyone loved it no one said they did n't like it even my dad to this day says he would n't mind watching the movie a few more times , and he never wants to watch a movie more than two times
this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out an excellent and energetic movie from the start plot is cutesy it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences however , i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes \? i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me
now , this is a rock n' roll show from rock 's good guys pearl jam is probably the most important band ever in american music they are to the us what led zeppelin was to britain this concert is a fantastic representation of their mature post millenium shows no , you wo n't see a lot of crowd surfing or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings , just a lot of great music , and wonderful lyrics mike mccready is quite possibly one of the world 's most underrated , soulful guitarists , and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing at first , i was not a fan of adding boom gaspar to the shows , but i have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band , as i do matt cameron , who filled in a revolving throne back when jack irons left due to back problems after yield
wonderful show , fun episodes , great actors dvd boxset comes with confidentials with behind the scene footage however , the confidentials are shortened versions from the full confidentials shown on television but only footage of the old series of doctor who was removed
what can i say , on a scale of 1 thru 10 this movie goes to 11 !
most people does n't realize that this band suck's ! ! ! !
this is a fascinating look at the journey through the first 5 books of the bible it 's a visual foundation for stories that all three major religions , the jews , the christians and the muslims , hold sacred to their faith and their traditions as a documentary , the journey takes place today in the midst of the modern day struggles and misunderstandings that make it realistic and thought provoking for our faith today
i love sandra bullock movies in this movie she is so innocent and falls in love with a man she has never spoken to but saves his life on the cta in the time that he is still in a coma his family , thinking she is their son 's fiancee , fall in love with her she inadvertantly falls in love with his brother i jus love the cinderella story line she is fantastic as well as the family and especially bill pullman
while roman polanski was avoiding authories in america in 1988 , he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller it stars harrison ford in a rather unique role that of a doctor , an every man type such as jimmy stewart in the man who knew too much without the indiana jones hype although filmed 18 years ago , it seems more contemporary that ever a fine thriller that even hitch would approve !
nice movie with a resonable story and a keeper for anyone looking to add in his collection great nude scenes with angelina jolie
this is a great documentary alex jones is not a nut , just very passionate about the quality \( or lack \) of our governments
the replicant proves that van damme can really act he again portrays two people as in double impact he is both a villan and his dna duplicate hence replicant van damme displays a great range of emotions as the replicant like a child discovering the world as the villan he 's truly psycho the feds make the replicant of this serial killer called the torch in hopes of learning how to catch him the story line will keep you watching , in suspense and guessing do n't look for all of the usual martial arts scenes here
everyone should see this movie it does not matter if your gay or straight
after much debate , i decided to view this film with an open mind the performances are outstanding i really liked the music composition , as it flowed gently with the story in a way , i'm glad this film didnt't win best picture for one reason the on location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch maybe its too perfect later on , we find out it 's not wyoming , but it alberta , canada take a star away ! overall , this is a movie that will advance gay right in the united states for those who do n't like it , the train has left the station !
astonishing you have to see it to believe just turn off the lights , seat back and have fun and amazon delivery is realy great
this is one of my favourite christmas movies along the lines of it 's a wonderful life modern style cage is perfect in this role surprisingly ! tea leone is a great supporting actress and the little girl is adorable all around a wonderful movie some mature content though so not for the younger viewers \( robbery and sexual nature in parts \)
the documentary was really , really good they left some stuff out of it , of course , but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense one thing i did not remember was the prodigious mullet brian sported back in the day man , i think that thing was more impressive than jagr 's cup winning mullet of the early 90s !
thank you wwe vince for making another great dvd box set and also stone cold i got it this morning and popped this bad boy in and love it a must buy if your a old school wrestling fan or a new one i do n't regret buying this at al
i'm new to the world of pilates and this dvd is very helpful the instructor explains everything clearly so that you can be sure of doing each pose correctly the great thing about this dvd is that now that i'm getting comfortable with pilates , i can continue using this video because it lets you chose workouts for beginners , intermediates , and advanced there 's no need to buy any additional dvds ! and days that i do n't have time to fit in a whole workout , it also gives you time ranges to choose from this video is worth buying for those wanting to try pilates i 've recommended it to my friends , and they all use it now
a movie not geared for morons ! what a rare find there are n't many movies that ca n't be figured out half way through this film is great very clever never saw the ending coming
skillful direction , screenplay , camera angles , acting \) i could n't understand benicio del toro 's mumbling it turns out he did that on purpose , as he said in the special features
a family oriented film that is humorous , fun , exciting and very entertaining ! after seeing this movie for the first time , i had to own it ! it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean this is a must own for the family
this movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres ! i think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts , which is when vivian tells edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best friend roommate and runs into her pimp boyfriend carlos the extras are fabulous and could n't be better so pick up a copy of this movie toda
pretty woman \( 15th anniversary special edition \) has to be considered one of the most classical , romantic comedies made throughout the years julia roberts and richard gere are excellent actors together and without them i do n't believe the movie would have been the same this classic fairy tale movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest this is not your typical romantic movie and i believe that is why so many people love this movie pretty woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there
armageddon
i never thought yoga could be so easy and beneficial
wow this a great series have to strongly recommend it yep has the feel of sienfeld with over the top humor clever , awkward , somewhat vulgar
over the years , people have grown tired of natural disaster movies why \? because they all appear to be the same here 's an example of a typical storyline everything starts out nice and calm , the story focuses on one family , the family starts having problems and they split up , and then a volcano , tornado , hurricane , or whatever hits , and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger just so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie
personally , i really enjoyed premonition it 's got solid acting , a fascinating \( and often heart wrenching \) story , and some decent scares however , do n't expect an all out fright fest or you 'll be sorely disappointed this is a story driven film , with a plot that progresses fairly slowly patience is necessary when viewing premonition , as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and dream like logic in a film but for those of you who possess those qualities , and are looking for something a little different \( particularly if you 're a fan of the genre \) , premonition might be for you
this movie is fantastic ! it is defo on my fav list one of the best !
setting theme \( s \) castlerock , smallville , summer friends' adventure , life 's lessons , solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown
i'm a colin firth fan , but that 's not the only reason this movie was a great ride it 's because it is a great ride just enjoy you will find yourself in stitches the contrast between new england dry humor and brit dry humor it 's just too funny oliver , colin you guys are the best ! ! !

half light is a movie my wife would like , if i can convince her that it 's not too scary for her she is the most timid of movie goers , and refuses to watch horror movies with me but half light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense there are some scares , but at the most tepid edge of today 's horror the movie is much more about the grief of a mother \( have the kleenex box close by \) , and has a big love story \( with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse ugh \) in the middle of it just the kind of thing my wife might like , when she 's willing to see something on her scary side unfortunately for me , this is not my kind of movie at all
the third installment of our favorite wizard has him meeting a new defense of the dark arts teacher along with some rather scary gatekeepers as the magical world hunts for sirius black harry 's godfather who has escaped from the dreaded azkaban prison meanwhile hermione discovers a way to time travel with a special locket and take more classes it is definitley getting darker and darker but this third in a series sets the tone for harry 's destiny
just like it used to be my son has enjoy every minute of i
these movies are just as great as i remembered them
csi miami , having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons , reaches its high point in season 3 anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio , unlike gil grissom or mac taylor , is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining , but the show is truly about him this dynamic , when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul , make this for me the csi that is above the rest
this dvd has footage i had never seen before on tv it has some of the best footage of the second plane hitting the towers it not only covers the new york disaster but also the penatgon and pennsylvania plus the war in iraq
hey richie , get a life
what 's not to like about the character of jack ryan \? he 's honest , ethical , modest , smart and rising like a shooting star in the us government wish he was real
great video , it will be a classic in the coming years as these entertainers are dying at a fast rate they are still as good as they were in the old days considering their age
dustin hoffman , arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s , is in top form here but this time as a woman sure , there have been other films with similar setups victor victoria with julie andrews and mrs doubtfire with robin williams , to name just two andrews , however , is n't believable as a man , and while williams is exceptional in doubtfire , that movie seems to lose its edge near the end in tootsie , jessica lange , teri garr , and dabney coleman all provide laudable even outstanding performances lange won an oscar for best supporting actress , and garr was nominated in that category dustin hoffman was nominated for best actor , sidney pollack for best director , and the film for best picture why did n't it win any of those three \? one word gandhi nevertheless , tootsie looks as though it were fun to make , and it is certainly fun to watch this is an absolute must for dustin hoffman fans

rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence , teenage angst , sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon 's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality in his screen debut , chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon , and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she can carry out his divine plan campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to , while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings \( especially his large penis \) and telling god he knows the best candidate will win
the film shows us the reality that is wal mart , many common criticisms , and many common misconceptions it successfully shows that all of the criticisms against wal mart are outright lies , half truths , distortions of facts , or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business it shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job it also shows how wal mart has actually increased america 's standard of living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least skilled amongst us able to attain high quality health benefits and a decent wage
on december 14 , 1944 , as american troops under general douglas macarthur slowly advanced toward the island of luzon , japanese guards at the puerto princesa prison camp on palawan committed a terrible act herding their allied war prisoners into trenches , they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive
ok , so it may not be in the 5 star league , but it 's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting my scouts think it 's too funny
a short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape !
cinderella ii dreams come true is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original cinderella and a few new ones the animation is amazing it 's filled with lush color \( except for muted color when the story calls for it \) and the animation looks very polished it 's really a sight to see
i bought this set a couple of weeks ago and just finished getting through it it is well worth the money you wo n't be sorry you bought it funny as it gets
where did this guy come from \? my daughter rented this eddie izzard dvd i was blind sided with the sophisticated , mime style humor of eddie izzard \( is this his real name \? is he really a he \? \) from hearing about genesis to wondering why noah had to get two of everything including ducks , eddie izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy nothing was off limits the queen mother , death , hopscotch , speed archeology , toasters , and achilles it is all here !
i was totally taken with this new rendition of the broadway musical the only downside is that i'm not much of an alec baldwin fan , but he did ok ! i encourage anyone who enjoys a heartwarming musical to see this one
what i enjoy most about this movie , is not what i particularly enjoyed when it first came out being 11 when it came out , i was attracted to the urbanism of which i was not too familiar with i did n't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood , but it was no inglewood either i think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film the urban youth seeing for the first time , thier lives on a film of this caliber , and the suburban youth somehow glorifying this life while i still enjoy the entire film , what i particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film the story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders , ca n't be tamed by her she sends him to live with his father , who is in many ways her equal but he is a man and one of her lines in the movie is i ca n't teach him how to be a man , that 's your job how true this is not to sound sexist , because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother , \( because of an abusive father , etc \) but you need a man to teach you to be a man larry fishburne 's charachter in this movie does this perfectly one quote , i know you think i'm being hard on you tre , but i'm not what i'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility your friends across the street do n't have anyone to do that , your'e gonna see how they end up , too i loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents \( while divorced \) raise their son the way they know best , and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal i 'd have to say that my favorite character is furious yes , reva \( tre 's mom \) played an equally strong part , but i loved how real furious was young tre i thought played an excellent part better than gooding jr \? maybe overall a great movie it 's success made it harder for corporate america to ignore the reality of inner city youth as it exists today
a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation \( many called it a ripoff \) with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work \( and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes \)
dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is one third of the films that are considered stanley kubrick 's masterpieces \( the other two are 2001 a space odyssey a clockwork orange \) it 's a satire , released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today whenever you look at a list of great movies , it 's on there it holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 \( 26 \) ,
this black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all this is a not just a courtroom movie , but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other reginald rose 's original play reads like a powerhouse , even in a highschool english class , but given the direction of sidney lumet , the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film
i feel this movie should be seen by all it 's awesome , and really makes you think you get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling i highly recommend it ! awesome movie
it 's really refreshing to watch series such as bones it 's witty and suspenseful unlike law and order , this show has more well everything
i have n't watched the first season i just started watching the show so i'm a very brand new viewer but i 've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show its subject matter is grim , yes , but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry , especially david boreanaz \( buffy the vampire slayer , angel \) and emily deschanel the stories are interesting w out being too scientific so anyone can follow along and i never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone 's bones \( okay , maybe only in tv land \)
`sophie scholl die letzten tage' \( `sophie scholl the final days' \) follows the last six days of the life of sophie scholl , member of `the white rose' small anti nazi organization that protested against hitler through the non violence method in the war time munich her life had been filmed in germany twice before `the white rose' by michael verhoeven , and `the five last days' by percy adlon both in 1982 unfortunately i have n't seen them , but the fact proves that this anti war organization during the wwii in germany , some part of which still remain mystery , has been always a very fascinating topic in that country

we own three baby faith dvd 's our favorite is god made music , followed by god made me god made animals , while still a good video , is our least favorite for one , the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing \( but judge for yourself , i 've posted some pictures \) the frog was creepy since when do frogs have lips \? the visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too and the undersea clips at the end looked as old as cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year old son , who is entranced by the other two videos but does n't seem to care much for this one my suggestion watch before you buy , if you can if your kid likes it , go for it if not , try the other videos you may get a different reaction
i do n't care what people say , i got it right off the bat , what the movie was about i joy it as well alien predator kids , it worked just fine for me you got to love predator kicking butt those cool look aliens it 's fun watching i 'll enjoy , years to come calling spaceship earth thank for the trip thanks for dropping me at back home based more on comic books alien vs predator not so much on passed alien movies or predator movies
i'm not a big fan of tom or demi , and jack even wears out his welcome in some films , but not here the supporting roles are superbly done , the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end , and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a half hour or so here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict , and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years i enjoy the script , because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force
i have been a fan of csi since the first season has come out i am an avid collector of dvds and i'm way behind , i'm on another show right now as we speak anyway , i love the sound , and the special features are always low , but i do n't mind that there is just one thing that i did not like part of the cover case on my season four dvd , came off it still fits into my dvd collection , and i obviously wo n't buy another copy because the dvd 's are working fine , but the plastic may come into a problem
had this movie on vhs and my family wore it out ! an unexpected gem in the harry potter tradition
this was a wonderful story telling about the hard working italian immigrants that started their businesses in new york their determination , long hours , and love of family represent the values those immigrants brought to america
could n't believe that this was the same john lithgow who starred in third rock from the sun , an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on nbc john plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by denzel 's character
seeing hearing a movie such as this in the german language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic
i became interested in this movie after reading the book ishmael by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ishmael there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization takers are mentioned but it comes across more as you just do n't know what you are missing by being one not that all of nature has had it heck , the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees but of course that was the main point of ishmael if we do n't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature , then nature has had it and so have we
this is a good cold war drama after a soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place , the race is on to recapture the film as was pointed out in the film , the soviets used their german scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from england 's german scientists using a special film developed by the us 's german scientists the film has the location of both side 's missile installations and both sides want it neither side will give an inch
i had to replace my video with this dvd version this movie is spectacular beautiful photography , excellent acting , and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time it is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in europe artemesia , whose father is an artist , is forbidden to draw or paint the human body her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure especially when trying to get her into the male only art school he finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an unlawful relationship he files rape charges and everyone suffers a brilliant social commentary
before i saw this sequel , i had heard and read that it was a terrible film however , be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it 's not as good as the original it 's full of so much self deprecating humor that you ca n't help but cut it a break i laughed quite a few times , and there are a lot of fun moments
so i do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena i have watched them all , marcus welby right on through er scrubs is the most realistic , albiet tongue in cheek representation of our professions you cannot take everything seriously , but , if you believe an emergency room can function like er 24 7 and still have people standing , you 're out of touch w reality as well
this is a must have dvd , not only for wrasslin' fans , but for all of mankind you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well
this dvd is hilarious ultimate warrior was a pretty cool character but legally changing his name to the warrior that is downright weird christain is too funny in his impressionation
this was my first exercise ball tape i bought being a larger size person , i found that this was a help to getting started i can do most of the exercises right away i like that it has exercises with weights also i find this a help to getting back into shape , even with my bad back
lots of good exercises and lots of helpful hints good dvd ! would recommend it to friends
director richard donner \( ladyhawke , superman , lethal weapon i , ii , iii , iv , etc \) leads an ensemble cast of stars gerard butler , billy connolly , frances o'connor , ethan embry , morton csokas and david thewlis back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist ! \( yeah ! i wrote those words ! not another critic yet it 's a true analysis of this fantastic film ! \)
this bbc miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce \( here the source material is not just one work but several works of dh lawrence \) than most literary adaptations for english television also , while most bbc productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward thinking characters in this case the sultry and sophisticated , and somewhat libertine \( in a 1920 's kind of way \) , lady chatterly the earthy and irreverent and smoldering \( smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class \) oliver mellors both of these factors can be attributed to director ken russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the bbc 's best programs \( many of them about musical composers \) russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking of course most of us in the states know ken russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as tommy \( 1975 \) , altered states \( 1979 \) , and , gothic \( 1986 \) all of which feature lurid dream sequences and , some would say , gratuitously lewd situations but ken russell is actually a director with many facets , and russell 's interest in dh lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best dh lawrence adaptation on film , women in love \( starring glenda jackson , oliver reed alan bates \) he then followed that up twenties years later with the rainbow \( starring amanda donohoe , and sammie davis \) both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books his additions , however , were tasteful and even added clarity to the material
sure , i could have compared phantom quest corp to a lot of other animes out there , but the basic premise is the same we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci fi mysteries and there is definitely nothing wrong with that
to be honest , i think i found this by looking at listmania lists when i was searching for other anime titles i had never heard of it , but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so i decided to give it a shot , although i did n't really expect too much boy am i glad i bought it ! the only thing i did n't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes i know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews , but i figured i should throw in my two cents anyway
when i saw this i though why not , it does n't look overly violent boy am i glad i tried it while there are the usual fight scenes the overriding theme is a wonderful sense of humor as a night owl , i adore the morning scenes using different , highly original , method to awaken the heroine a real keeper and i just wish it was a long series
this is the best way to spend the evening with your children it is very well done , and the actors made this a neverland not to forget we have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it , buy it , but most of all watch it
i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity , he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time , and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs , and you 're infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint , and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again , they come up with this idiotic scheme , which ended up in disaster \( both the hilton and auto world closed within a year \) moore in recent years has become a political celebrity , in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it 's not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them are n't really interested in changing anything , as it might interfere with their livelihoods i do n't know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent , darkly funny film about real class warfare , and the dismantling of the working class in america
leftist anti establishmentarian
a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast , great performances , great story , just a great film unique approach to the subject , characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion , characters played by julianne moore , don cheadle , heather graham , william h macy , and burt reynolds respectfully , are great to watch this is a performance piece
i love this movie how can you not with such hilarious diologue \? one of my most favorites is when yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of kuzko ending with a hilarious i 'll smash it with a hammer ! but diologue aside , there 's so much more to this movie the characters are so wonderfully individual , from self absorbed kuzko , to evil yzma with her secret lab , to dim witted kronk with his shoulder angel and devil
wonderful to find in the sale just as my tape was wearing out delightful movie , well acted by all but especially wonderful performance by bridges as the human alien hybrid a superb print too thanks amazon you did it again
frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound this is due to its subject , its star , and its director , julie taymor , who also gave us the astounding titus \( if you have not yet seen titus , do so before finishing this review it is an art director 's tour de force on a par with brazil \)
we enjoy listiening and watching this dvd on our hdtv we play this when have friends over with the volume low and find them humming or singing along
of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of allah on that day , this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching because of this , those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events and perhaps none more so than caesar in his review of sept 17 , 2006 if only he found at least as troubling the carnage , bloodshed , and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his islamic buddies against civilian populations but , more on this in a bit
wow , i watched this on the national geographic channel and i was so astonished at some of the details , that i had to buy it it should be a must buy for any library across this country i encouage every american to watch this
if you have never been introduced to thora birch this is the one to see i do n't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film if there were ever a star born this is it she is just unbelievable griffin and johnson are really great too this movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone
somehow denis leary and peter tolan managed to improve on an already amazing show rescue me continues to be the best show out there
i have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie i just know that i had to buy it b c i rented it so often napolean is such a loser his brother kip could have a huge l on his own forehead
falling in love 1984 is one of my favorite romantic 80s movies , i have two laserdisc copies one new and the other is used and i have it on dvd too , you gotta give it a try you will love it too
in all of the other x men dvds , they show very little on the couple that i like the best kitty and lance the first episode joyride , is when lance joins the x men not everyone is pleased , but almost all are scott is the one who hates lance and doese n't believe that lance is doing this out of truth well when cars , jets , start mysterisoly getting very dirtty scott blames it all on lance but is it lance or is someone else having the joyride \? \? and walk on the wild side is a episode very good towards girl power jean , boom boom , rouge , magma , kitty decide to become the bayville sirens stoping crime and wearing leather in the process the other two epsiodes are worth getting the disc after all , any x men dvd is worth it
now with the release of the '38 version of 'a christmas carol' i can once again enjoy the antics of the grumpy old ebenezer scrooge as played by reginald owens in my opinion not as good as the later alastair sim version in '51 , but all in all a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the whole family
this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch , even if it does n't feel as audacious as i'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby , it is the epitome of all opposites attract love stories as a twenty year old depressive connects with a 79 year old life loving woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death , as they keep showing up at the same funerals however , the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive , while the hearse driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all
this presents us with a visual voyage into music that , in my opinion , excels that if the original fantasia not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid , colorful , and highly diverse from segment to segment , but the representation of the music is , in itself , sheer genius as i have come to expect from disney , at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure this much , i believe , is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music
i have to say , it took me a while to getting around to seeing this i thought silence of the lambs was good it featured a great performance by anthony hopkins , and the rest of it was good but that was about it , as far as i was concerned it just did n't really click with me , and it was n't anything near the great movie i 'd been hoping for , so when its sequel was released i did n't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released a bit surprisingly though , i thought hannibal was really great once i finally did see it everyone said it was more geared toward horror than silence \( which is fine by me \) and it may have been , marginally but much more than that , it was just a better horror movie than its predecessor , and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie , in my opinion hopkins is just as good , if not better , than he was as dr hannibal lecter the first time around , and while i usually do n't like recasting roles in a movie \( unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you do n't see their real face or hear their real voice , and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong \) julianne moore did a great job stepping into the clarice starling role originally played by jodie foster
we just got this dvd last week , but ever since that time it has remained in the dvd player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter , cassidy she loves this dvd and all the planets that come to life she sings along and has really learned her planets the songs are top notch the dvd is enjoyable for adults , even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful a

the five people you meet in heaven is a powerful book with many mixed emotions this film was a constant mystery as i never knew what would happen next the story is all about the people who affected eddie the most in his life the people he meets in heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking some people he knew , and some he had never met this was a great idea

very exciting and will keep you glued to your seat i have just watched \( 2006 \) for first time
federico fellini 's 1972 film is not his best , when he has 8 1 2 , la strada and la dolce vita to his credit while many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring and phantasmagorical it is simply fellini 's version of rome and not rome , the eternal city itself to risk sounding negative , i shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970 's rome the scenes in which the hippies and american tourists invade the city , the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off \( though saying some pretty vulgar things \) and my favorite scene the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old roman patricians fade into oblivion but mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot it starts off alright , and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences fellini is himself in this movie , as well as gore vidal fellini envisions himself as a young man studying rome in his youth in a strict catholic school \( the slide projector shows ancient monuments like the colliseum , the apian way , trevi fountain and vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman 's behind \) and later as a young man journeys to rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless , vulgar and long winded i found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage ! it bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women the cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film and for a film about rome and italy , there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater the pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous only serious , hardcore fans of fellini will want to own this dvd it is a perfect follow up to his equally absurd and sexually radical satyricon , loosely based on the old roman epic
this dvd is the bomb ! why \? prince puts on a show from morris day and the time \( a must see \) to the lenny kravitz and prince jam session true prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity
if you 're even showing an interest to vol 2 then you most likely own or have seen vol 1 even then i recommend this one as much as any of them , since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end anyways , vol 2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol did , but unfortunately when compared to vol 1 you 'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all any sword fighting that actually occur usually does n't last long enough to be considered a fight but this dvd makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol so enjoy it , i know i did
you gotta get the whole series you ca n't just get one or two dvds you need the whole thing , trust me once you start you gotta go all the way to the end
this movie is worth owning it 's a classic tale , well done and very entertaining
this is a great kid 's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot it 's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices \) i would suggest not over thinking the story line , it 's a kid 's movie after all and no its not all about the flying cars , believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more !
this is a classic musical that i grew up watching on network tv it has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys i bought it to share with my kids and they loved it
i did n't watch this one before
wow , i was so excited to see this available on dvd this is from the era of cartoon geniuses these cartoons are good for all ages and will never go out of fashion i can not wait to have kids and show this to them it beats the violence and tone of cartoons today this is my choice for a cartoon lovers collection a must have enjoy
i was just gonna watch the film because i think robert de niro is one of the greatest actors ever , but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of being black that truly adds another factor to this film it 's a trip out film
this movie has recieved several bad reviews and i can understand that this movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical first gay love movie , but if you like movies that are not , this one if a must have the movie is not a hardcore sex movie , in fact there is only one scene of sex , in the movie the positives of this movie are , it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love , one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray again , i only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex
i love this movie while the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film , she 's all that does n't go overboard and , surprisingly , presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata
what more could a true parrotthead ask for than jimmy buffett live at wrigley field \?
i have always enjoyed watching this movie , with so many great stars , some whom are no longer with us never owned it on video , now i have it on dvd , great price too ! ! it was worth it
if there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides saving private ryan , this is it
this is like the classic that killed other classics for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime so anime was never the same around this time based off the manga loosely i mean some parts are changed or edited over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh a very hyper violent film lot 's of action !
this film was originally titled the testimony of taliesin jones it is named for the hero , a little welsh boy whose mother leaves his farm family for a life in town his experiences are touching , and seem to involve a gift of healing
this dvd is the best dvd by far for how to dj awesome interviews and 2nd disc does excellent job of showing you all you need to know about how to dj do not waste money on other cheap and cheesy dj dvds like i did , spend the extra few bucks and i knwo you will be happy with this purchase
i was given the special fan remix edition of this film last christmas , and i must say , the so called bonus features only detract from the wonderful original so stick with the original
after buying the original the fast and the furious i found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it however , i can now say i am a fan of the trilogy \( all 3 films are good \)
michael par \( into the sun space fury \) , nancy allen \( limit up robocop \) , two famous star in 80 's , made this a five star sci fi movie but no subtitle or closed captioned , so i will give it 4 5 star
i am very disappointed with this movie the philadelphia experiment that have no english subtitles , due to my deafness i was planning to buy this dvd
this dvd takes some of the funniest episodes from the series the dvd is put together quite well and episodes are taped better than vhs the only problem is with 1 or 2 episodes it splits for a quick second , but i would recommend to anyone who like any lucille ball items
i love leslie sansone 's videos she 's quirky and a bit ditzy , but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun this is no exception there have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough , but i had absolutely no problems even on my first try if you do n't want to miss a beat , pay close attention at first you 'll hear the directions
excellent pay per view one of the best of 2002 here 's the matches
i found the movie to be very creative and unique i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set up for a play would be i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words message there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed greed true love spirituality determination self esteem issues and jealousy i am not a prince fan , but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day , and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman , who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them \( clever \) i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic , morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
sybil is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public the performances by sally field and joanne woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter \( child abuse \) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques , both the book and the movie became musts for students of abnormal psychology at that time and for decades afterwards
this is my first watp video , but i started at the highest mile because i am an intermediate advanced exerciser so i knew i needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going , but mostly i was looking for variety in my workout and i must say , i just love this video it is the only video i own that makes me want to do it i truly enjoy working out , but when i find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up , i know i hit the jackpot this workout can be perfect for most exercisers , although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the super challenge leslie is a good instructor , but as most have mentioned , she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh but its about the workout , not the sound of her voice , and in that , watp super challenge accomplishes alot i hope to buy more of her videos in the future
as an american i find this video showing the incredible distruction and the first responders who are operating at the scene of this enormous tragedy compelling to think that this terrorist attack actually happened on our soil is truly unbelievable another reviewer from france states that the footage is nothing special ! that is the furthest from the truth ! i guess the he believes that the terrorist attack never took place ! this is an historic document that should be seen by every american !
this is a great video , my daughter learned all her abc 's with the letter factory and now she is learning words and she is not even two yet ! go leap frog
i had no idea what i had missed i bought this set at sam 's club for 18 \( now i see what a deal i really got \) i watched every minute and loved it if you have n't seen it do ! and , maybe check out sam 's club for your own copy at an incredible price
very entertaining ! except few scenes , i really enjoyed this movie \( but hey , nothing is perfect , right \? except maybe lotr \) you should buy this dvd or at least rent it , watched , and then decide i watched it few times and i will more in the future ! good romantic comedy !
this is easily one of the best films of the 80 's kevin bacon is a god in this movie he plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil when the footloose song comes on the radio , my co worker tom and i cant help but busting into dance its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet ! ! buy this dvd for your collection and you 'll be bursting into dance before u know it !
an animated family of x men complete with spandex it all turns out pretty well incredible
it 's interesting to read some of the other reviews i ca n't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie it 's imaginative , as was nightmare before christmas , but goes beyond that movie with even better stop action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving i loved nightmare , but corpse bride takes all the things i loved and made them better the voices of all the actors ring true the mood is gothic and yet comical the score is rich and defines the movie perfectly \( the dvd allows you to watch the movie with only the music , and that 's a real plus \)
awesome ! bought for my husband for valentine 's day ! even our 8 year old son loved it excellent condition
great story great actors beautiful scenery and colors my favorite movie
student of history is a student of christian biased history there are plenty of qualified scholars , and current book like that of theologian bart ehman for one , who show that early christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree , but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in judea were about \( not paliestine ! the romans named the region palestine after the war against the jews in 70ce \) the fact that one man \( constantine \) sought a single authoritive finality was a political move , not an act or miracle of god authority of apostles is more christian myth and power assertion , not historical proof of the varacity of the bible and christian claims objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father \( probably iraneus \) forged copies of josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to jesus it is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then ! handwriting is sort of a give away , especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about jesus what is known about the gospel of thomas and other second century altnative christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner it might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts people with no authority like iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult he called arius of alexander for example , a heretic but he had no authority to do so he forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future , others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers paul called it lying to bring you the truth but a lie is a lie and historians ca n't make lies facts so the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth
i have loved this movie since i first it back in the early 1990 's in all honesty it is pretty crudy but that 's what i love about it the music is fantastic and the costumes are unique divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and ricki lake was perfect for the role link is pretty hunky too
i never tire of this film the acting , the marvelous filming locations , the costumes perfection i ca n't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing in fact , i once stopped the video , baked scones , and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa try it i now own the dvd also
i have no idea why i had never heard of this movie before because ronin is a whale of a good film i can take or leave most action films , but give me a taut , intelligent , suspenseful thriller filled with great action , wicked twists , and some of the best car chasing footage you 'll ever see , and i'm happy throw jean reno and the one and only robert de niro into the mix , as well , and i'm happier than any clam has a right to be director john frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone does n't make for a good action film , and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene
the bells of st mary 's was a shrewd move by paramount studios and director leo mccarey , whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical catholic priest father o'malley , going my way , spawned the 1945 release , which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict irish catholic mccarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed going my way and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the catholic world inhabited by father o'malley
i really did i would watch it almost everyday ! it was my favorite movie back then ! i held this tradition until \( sob \) my mom threw away our copy ! i do n't care if the tape was old ! i still wanna see it ! \( i'm gonna buy it on dvd soon ! \) fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy it 's an original story that should make you cry it even has a pretty funny ending ! i ca n't wait to see this movie again anyway , this movie is about a man who dies in a car crash and gets reincarnated as a dog i know a lot of peeps out there that do n't believe in reincarnation but just remember , this is fiction anyway , as he grows older , he wants to see his wife and kid even more he decides to find them he one day sees them in a parking lot \( and ca n't remember what they did , the last time i saw this movie was a couple years ago \) and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife she told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away \( i think \) i sadly ca n't remember what happened after that but i know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet the mother agrees , reluctantly i dont remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends and uh no ! i need to watch the movie again ! ! ! i just bought the book , so after i read the book , i plan to watch the movie bwa ha ha ! ! ! anyway , it 's a fun filled movie watch it
the guy shirtless , tied up , abs muscles so vulnerables to let the punisher to torture this guy until he cant almost breath and cry for mercy just an upper stomach being beaten to make this guy suffer a pain he will never forget
the story line was very moving anthony hopkins and morgan freeman are always fantastic in any movie they do it is well worth the price and well worth the time to watch
how many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy , perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat , lazy slob \? or maybe it was an arrogant hollywood trainer with that fitter than thou sneer these instructors just do n't seem like real people with real lives outside the gym , do they \?
witch hunter robin is a great series which i enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series the visuals are first rate , the music \( when there is music \) is beautiful , and the storyline is intriguing
season 1 of millennium featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made the x files look sunny by comparison unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a murder mystery of the week fare thankfully the second season , supervised by former x files producers glen morgan and james wong , changed all that the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end' , where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two , computer hacker brian roedecker
one of the most maligned movies of 2004 is not that bad in a fine example of how critics and hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it , oliver stone delivers an epic take on the life of alexander the great not up to par with the great hollywood epics , but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe
this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film
this movie is going to bring you down that 's a fact but it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves
seriously ! at the end of fat eliminator minna says do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change it 's true i have been doing this dvd and only this dvd for about a month now 3 days a week is fat eliminator and 2 days is strength and grace and my body is firm ! i have abs now , biceps and definition in my thighs and buns extra flab is gone this is a fantastic workout combination fe is tough , particularly the first three cardio circuits those plyo jumping jacks are killer once i get through that third cardio circuit though i feel like i 've already had a good workout and i'm only halfway through ! i work up a sweat i ca n't even answer the phone because i could n't talk even if i wanted to it 's definitely focused on your lower body with lots of jumping and plyo and core work but the circuits are quick and they really do go by quickly the workout is also fantastic in that just when you feel like you ca n't do one more plyo lunge , she changes the pace to something more less impact the 15 minute blast the fat toning section i always add onto the cardio days it 's nice , quick and effective and in one hour while my son is napping i get in a total body workout
the movie one of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90 's , and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved , this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind and despite the whining from some , usually hardline christian , corners , it 's not anti christian at all what it is is simply great , imaginative and clever film making , and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from mimi rogers , ably supported by the likes of david duchovny , will patton and patrick bauchau
there are many reviews here and i believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree my main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once if you do , it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place daniel day lewis once again makes this film you feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the wrong woman \( pfeiffer \) after being engaged to the right woman \( ryder \) he is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film due to circumstances beyond his control , he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman there is a palpable , underlying eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by day lewis and pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair
after the original , herbert west \( jeffery combs \) and dan cain \( bruce abbot \) have returned from medical miltary duty in south america as they return back home as they have perfected their re agent formula to continue experimentint but herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of cain 's old girlfriend meg to create the perfect re animated woman , however dr carl hill \( david gale \) has been re animated back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what west did to him
this show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal from the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i 've been a huge fan of the series i was so sad to hear it 'd been cancelled but i was n't surprised it was one of the shows i loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air now that the dvds are out i can relive these 13 fleeting moments in tv that are , to me , some of the funniest things i 've ever seen apart from the hilarious , oddball performances from michael michael and david the series was packed with guest stars including edward norton , paul rudd , and a whole lot more really , anyone that is a fan of comedy ala strangers with candy will find this funny it has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts
excellent series the court room scene is hilarious i am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti americanism of this series \( i refer to the portrayal of the american guest \) as well as in upstairs downstairs \? in both series , as in other british tv dramas , americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic what about the henry james edith wharton type aristocrats who toured england in the 19th century \? mr hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them
if you 're a fan of vampires , werewolves , action , or gothic suspense , this is probably a movie you 'd be interested in checking out while it 's not a groundbreaking film , it 's a highly entertaining one , and one that , for me , is something i can rewatch several times per year
this is the best animal movie i have ever seen from a child 's point of view this has been our daughter 's favorite movie for the last one year or so \( she 's 3 now \) and after watching it almost every day \( sometimes several times a day \) she still enjoys it as much ! we 're surprised that even we are not tired of it the animals are fun to watch , the story is interesting and the music is great we 've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them the production is superb , the animals did a great job and it all seems so real a must by for everyone who has small kids
as i understand it , police squad was one of the most requested titles for release on dvd it 's taken a while for it to happen , but it finally has ! it 's great to be able to replace my vhs tape that i recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a police squad marathon having now watched the dvd , i now know that for almost 20 years , i 've been watching heavily edited versions of the show but not anymore !
the full frame version is just that , the unmatted full frame of the filmed image the widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen \( this is how it was originally shown in theaters \) in two spots the dvd lies about the full frame version , saying that it 's a pan scan trimming of the widescreen picture
season 1 wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit , incredible acting for a tv series , and classic plots all around a great opening season for a classic show
dark atmospheric telling of the tale very decent ! it is a simply told ancient tale the scenery is gorgeous there 's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time it 's a good movie , a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end
i loved this movie for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done in the american version all it was was sarah michelle gellar 's face the japanese version was much better \( considering it was original and made more sense \)
this film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it the plot is not very intriguing , and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life , so it lacks this sense of reality a dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer , which is exactly the point of this movie
in all fairness , this film is advertized on the package as a docudrama and not as a drama the problem is that it is n't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary as a documentary about the reenactment , this is a fine collection of footage , interspersed with some \( thankfully \) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides \( actually , i thought the actor portraying longstreet did a fine job the others were less convincing \) as a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle
watching once and again is one of the most painful television shows to watch , let along watch again this is not because it is a bad television show , but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date i would like to be able to identify with rick , but my personal situation is more like that of jake , and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them watching once and again the complete second season on dvd , the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning there is a moment when she reads her parents , lily and jake , the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace , but also ending up with less years where the family \( scribbling rivalry \) anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again if you have been spared that particular experience , then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through
this was a blast from the past for my husband and i we purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it it fits right where they are in school , and they laugh while they are learning often when we are doing homework , i 'll say that 's what they said on the electric company or remember what the electric company said this letters sound like \? and they do it 's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them it 's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school plus i have to admit , seeing morgan freeman and bill cosby in this is quite hilarious \( mistakes and all !
using the g8 summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed \( at least to me \) like a recipe for disaster , but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy , the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem do n't miss it
this is a very enjoyable , laid back film about the music and spirit of one of our greatest rock musicians i love neil young 's music , and i love this film
i went into this dvd with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it maybe enjoy is n't the right word , it is intense , it is political \( and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics \) and it jumps around from subplot to subplot in fact , i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks but i found it very plausible and that is what a good movie should do give a plausible thesis and play it out it succeeds here it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence sure , it makes the gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them , but that usually makes for a good starting point , since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and or greed anyway i once heard a history professor say it is n't about the struggle of good vs evil , it is always about the struggle of good vs good both sides always think they are right and god is on their side watch it , you will come out the other side thinking
this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from mr gore , but this movie gave me a new realization that being in office would have held this man back his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do mr gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes he gives a website climatecrisis net for more ideas and info if you think this might be too boring for your taste , give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish
i thought this movie was pretty good i 've seen a lot of nicholas cage movies \( 8mm , the rock , con air , etc \) so maybe i am biased towards him
i enjoyed ice age , and this movie is good as well thankfully , all of the cast from the original ice age returned , and the comedy as well and , besides the characters , the story is another original idea , and a great stand alone movie by itself , and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one the ice age is coming to an end , and our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for higher ground before their valley gets flooded manny , along the way , begins to question his own mortality and the fact that he is the last mammoth or is he well , that what everybody thinks , until they run across a family of opossums do n't see how opossums and mammoths tie together , just watch the movie queen latifah was a good addition to the cast great film , one for the collection
star wars , in any format , will always be the greatest movie of all time
what a great story and an ending ! i was so excited about the conclusion of this 2 hr program that i coud n't sleep at all
wonderful
monk is quite an interesting show it is about this character named adrian monk \( played by tony shalhoub , wings \) , who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias he is also incredibly intelligent he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly , provided that he has all the right clues the most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words , which , for some of the most intense cases , will really shock the audience i 've solved the case however , for some reason , the best part always seems to be when he says , here 's what happened
i did not see john carpenter 's original version of assault on precinct 13 , but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake i was paying attention so i knew what the set up was , both inside and out of the precinct , as we went along but being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in james demonaco 's script \( i made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters i was sure would survive all the bullets and i was half right , which is a polite way of saying i was half wrong \)
maybe better than the original i liked that they focused on wonka 's childhood throughout the film that was something that really added to the storyline they really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal , too i guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original was n't anywhere to be seen in this one , but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it
having seen stella 's live show in hollywood , i had a sneaking suspicion that i was going to love their comedy central show , and i was not disappointed these guys have mastered the art of genius disguised as idiocy , and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end i guess i'm not surprised it did n't last this kind of humor is n't for everyone but come on we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include mind of mencia and blue collar comedy , both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer these guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years , and i hope to see them in another show or movie soon until then , i 'll be enjoying stella on dvd
that is really what a b c said when they took this , the funniest show ever on t v , off the air in less than six shows my friends in high school and i watchedcthis show every time it came on it was a parrody of all the cop shows from the 60 's and 70 's and was falling down funny later the group who gave us airplane would retool their baby into the naked gun movies and make a mint at the boxoffice each show could be watched many times just to catch the jokes you missed i'm so happy that they have all six shows on dvd now , and i can get rid of the old cut up copy that i had on vhs and remember smoke , yes i know , but what happened
this film is a gripping true life portrait of the path poverty takes when it \( poverty \) decides to destroy life and hurt those who cannot defeat its ties of depression
i really loved this story ! each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding
the thing i like about this movie was that it was wholesome , something the whole family could watch together without having to worry about bleeping the bad parts out ! cute , entertaining story with some romance thrown in for interest
stagecoach is significant , along with destry rides again , for redefining the western for adult audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes \( the gambler , the prostitute with a heart of gold , etc \) but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah , dallas , and thomas mitchell as doc boone , for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless
i watched this movie and once it finished i decided i had to log on to amazon and buy it up this film is so well done , from the characters , the actors , the dialogue and the stories a pure enjoyment to watch i hope everyuone sees it at least once
this film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted occasionally the film lets itself down with it 's editing i sometimes feel disorientated thinking wait slow down will you having said that this film is well acted , and really puts you in the netherlands of the 19th century it may not be as hard hitting and exciting as turkish delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching
i love good underrated movies , they make you feel like you 're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs i'm not a movie buff , but deep cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic great acting , memorable lines , interesting \( and logical \) plot and a decent ending
where do i start \? jack nicolson is a magnificant actor he can play anybody and his performance in this film was top notch i recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out i guarantee you will be satisfied
spider man \( 2002 \) the first spider man film
i saw this movie for the first time when i was 5 i'm still watching it at 65 they will never be another movie to surpass this one
the movie was terrific , and the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars , was because there was quite a bit of spanish in the film , and the subtites from spanish to english did n't seem to work on my copy english subtitles appeared for engliish , and spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke spanish ! strange fortunately i know some spanish , so i could sort of pick it up , but i do n't know why the sub titles did n't work anyway , bogie was very good and the story was too three men set out to find gold , and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey besides all that were the usual bandits and indians and so forth but it kept you watching and that 's what really counts wo n't tell you if they got any gold !
i thought this was a very good film well written filmed cast and acted very dark humor i myself would have used lawyers guns and money by warren zevon and knockin' on heavens door , bob dylan on the sound track
this movie is so touching i loved the determination of the girl it 's been a while since i 've seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters' names my children got hooked on foreign films after watching this movie with me a great family movie or just a clean chick flick
i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it ! ! ! !
ellen , the young boy 's stepmother , gets involved in this frightening story quite by accident in the shower it is necessary to actually tear apart the shower door to attempt to save her the pulse is in the tv , the electricity , the hot water everywhere naturally nobody believes them when they try to explain what it is i have watched this video several times and i'm still not sure myself a real thriller get it while you can exclusively at amazon com
i ca n't wait for this second season to finally be released i bought the first set on a whim and wow was i pleasantly surprised i never knew alfred hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro 's and exits during each episode
what can one add to what 's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time \? citizen kane has been analyzed more than any other movie , in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as kane itself it 's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary the battle over citizen kane and the hbo film rko 281
fred astaire plays a dnacer returning to england from a trip abroad in the customs shed he meets ginger rogers in an embarassing predicament he tries to find out who she is , but she refuses to tell him , and he spends ages searching london for her until he finally tracks her down and begins to awaken her interest ginger goes down to brighton with her friend dithery much married alice brady , and astaire and his dithery lawyer friend edward everett horton go in pursuit ginger has gone to brighton to try and obtain a divorce , she intends to spend the night with a professional co respondent somthing astaire says makes her think he is the co respondent , which puts her right off him fortunately the real co respondent , a diminutive italian , turns up \( your wife is safe with tonetti , he prefer spaghetti \) and the mystery is sorted out but what will happen when ginger 's husband arrives the next morning \? will she get her divorce this is a wonderful film , with a silly but extremley funny plot , and some wonderful dialogue , particularly between horton and brady , who somehow manage to end up married to each other , much to their surprise an absolutely delightful film
this dvd set was outstanding the 5th and 6th seasons of seinfeld were at the height of the show great extras !
the legend of zelda complete animated series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children 's cartoon should be , right there with teenage mutant ninja turtles , street sharks , and recess the legend of zelda was \( and still is \) such an exceptional video game series for all ages , and the tv show followed in its footsteps it combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one liners , and some jokes that still today make me laugh lookin' good , princess ! 'specially from this angle ! as children we see link yell that to zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences but later , that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee , and wonder how we ever missed it before
this is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor i really enjoyed watching it i think it has great replay value as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness i found it more reminiscent of the old 60 's films like 'monte carlo or bust' or 'those magnificent men ' jackie chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action packed foil to 'fillius fogg' played with brilliant english reserve self deprecating humor by 'steve coogan' there 's no comparison to the original the film does n't even try to copy rather , it takes a silly story with silly character 's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action adventure comedy movies you 'll see because this is n't a typical 'martial arts' vehicle for 'jackie chan' i found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline check out for instance the fight scene in the art gallery which goes to show why 'jackie chan' is probably the best action comedy star in the world right now there 's much that 's chaplain keaton like in his performance all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts the guest stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices , most notably 'it 's a mad , mad , mad , mad world' \( what i think is the best comedy ever this is by no means a comparison \) anyway 'arnold swarzenneger' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a turkish prince no less \( possibly the poorest arabian impression ever , which is of course why it works so well \) and 'rob schneider' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice miss 'cecile de france' is a beautiful comedy foil manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent i hope to see more from her you might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but i found a lot of it to be nicely restrained , this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set , check out the extras all in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy action adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing
the main character , lebowski , is a bum of a person living in los angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by john goodman and steve buscemi suddenly lebowski 's life is changed when he is mistaken for another lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters
the dude , that or , uh , his dudeness , or , uh , duder , or el duderino if you 're not into the whole brevity thing those are the dude 's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other jeffery lebowski you 're probably thinking what is he talking about , who is the other jeffery lebowski \? , well i 'll tell you in just a moment , i 've just got some things to clear up first joel and ethan coen have made some of the most loved films of all time , and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos team of all time these fellows bought you the cult favourite blood simple , the hillarious raising arizona , the decietful millers crossing , the crazy barton fink , the hudsuckers proxy , and the blood drenched fargo , and now this , one of the finest films they 've done , the big lebowski jeff bridges is jeffery lebowski or in this case , the dude john goodman plays the vietnam veteran walter , steve buscemi is not in it too often , but he plays the loveable donnie let 's just go through the character sketches \( only the dude 's bowling pals \)
i was a teenager in the 80 's , so i love all of the old 80 's teen movies , but some kind of wonderful makes my top three the performances were believable the actors became the characters , not the other way around eric stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks \( literally \) who wants to pursue art instead of business mary stuart masterson is his best friend , a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him lea thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty and her boyfriend craig scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend and the only off note
based on historical events which are still poorly undertsood , this movie depicts werner heisenberg and niels bohr the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the 1920s and 1930s caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to heisenberg 's famous uncertainty principle \( which demonstrates mathematically that you cannot know both the exact speed and position of a single electron \) drawing from the tony award winning play by michael frayn \( who also wrote noises off \) , the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men \( sometimes together with bohr 's wife \) who meet in copenhagen in 1942 when heisenberg , the german , who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb , visits his mentor and colleague bohr , the dane who is living through nazi occupation of his native land there are deep unresolved questions about the motives of heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue , the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow , including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and bohr 's home note i enjoyed the movie as much as the play in an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers , this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance
i enjoyed the first season and got it eagerly awaiting season 2 see it for sale overseas in the uk but not here \? tough waiting so long sigh i can do other formats besides north america but it 's a pain c'mon guys , i 'd rather spend the money here
the grapes of wrath is a great movie , perhaps one of the best i have ever seen however , having read the book , i notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out by taking out these crucial , yet quiet scenes the movie has a faster pace than the book
why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release \? connery in a remake of thunderball is this not a relesae by the same production company \? it is a mgm release , so why does n't it ever get included \? any light that can be shed would be greatly appreciated
there simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than frank gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work he has both his passionate lovers and haters i am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle i really love some of his work , while i find some of his work to be quite off putting the person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of gehry 's work , art critic claude jencks \( the person who popularized the term postmodern \) jencks , for whose deceased wife gehry designed a memorial building , states bluntly that gehry has made some ugly buildings i think with gehry more than most architects , one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition whatever else one may say about gehry , he is n't like other architects
we love these movies ! they entertain the child as well as the adult ! we went through a period where we watched these every night before bed ! much better than the baby einstein collection ! we 've made this our designated baby shower gift ! everyone should have a copy ! they are good for parents as a stress relief you do n't even need to watch them , just have them playing in the background , the music is absolutely wonderful i love when i catch my kids humming the music as they are playing perfect for any age , boy or girl ! thank you hbo
i loved the movie it has a lot of hidden symbols , like almodovar is accustomed to doing however , the music was the best
warner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore and or polish up their best movies and again they do not disappoint ! warner home video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time ! the set is well presented with excellent digital transfer , wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras
the great dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director , charlie chaplin the movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of world war 2 and at the rise of the nazi party the similarities between dictator adolf hitler and the comedic genius that is charlie chaplin is quite interesting both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year , same month , in the same week chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing hitler for this film he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film
every film in this collection is a gem annie hall and manhattan are both top notch , followed by bananas , everything you wanted to know about sex , sleeper heck , even interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice but to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are stardust memories and love and death these two films are probably woody 's least talked about , but really , i think they are both fantastic films love and death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his earlier , funnier works but you can see in the dialogue of love and death that woody was maturing and stardust memories , my favorite woody film this film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an artist who is trying to figure out what they want to say and how to say it maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these dvd 's but for the money , you ca n't beat the price of this set
these movies are beautiful and intense , one of those you must watch and enjo
if you 're looking for a silly movie with no content , this is not a collection for you the series is a great insight to a range of human emotions and finding your true self i recommend it to anybody who loves good movies just beware this set has english subtitles , so if you do n't like that you can think twice before commiting to a purchase
i don`t like it a whole lot , but it`s pretty good ! i liked the older elmo movies better than this one

i'm not one to go in length about films on amazon , but i 'll write a short little bit for this amazing film i first saw this 10 years ago when i was in my teens and have never forgotten it , it really touched something inside of me , much like a great piece of art would affect you after seeing it up close for the first time
hal hartley never fails to entertain , never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level simple men is no exception the seemingly simple plot two brothers in search of their missing dad provides so much room for character growth that i wish there were an entire series of films centered around them
not being familiar with yoga , i chose this dvd because of rodney yee 's reputation and the low cost what i found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed , and yet energized , after the first session there are no bells or whistles , just a great workout i 've purchases two other titles in the series , power yoga strength and power yoga stamina , and i switch off each workout some of the moves are more difficult than others , but it gives you something to work up to if i could n't do a stretch , i would go as far as i could and hold it it was a great feeling when i was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly i was unable to do aside from these video 's , the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain i do know this for a fact
if you love adam sandler 's comedy , you 'll adore this outstanding snl compilation of the best of adam sandler it features all his best skits , and outlines how great and wonderfully talented this actor comedian is also featured in this dvd are skits with the great chris farley , mike myers , and other great snl stars
when daryl deever \( william hurt \) tells tv reporter tony sokolow \( sigourney weaver \) he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor , he gets more than he bargained for deever is a good guy , smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms he 's sort of engaged to his best friend 's sister , but he 's had a crush on sokolow for two years when the man in the building gets his throat slit , sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her , so he tells her he may know something she goes after the story and he goes after her sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated , capable man known as joseph \( christopher plummer \) , who is good friends with sokolow 's parents it becomes clear that her wealthy parents , their rich friends and joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for jews to escape from the soviet union and to journey to israel and it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement , too before long , the man 's associates learn of deever 's gambit with sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing more lethally , the real murderer learns of what deever said to sokolow and believes deever might actually know something he goes after deever
most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult that 's why i love melville 's le samourai , not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles this film does n't require many lines of speech the main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect while trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him my first melville film and i loved it if you like this one you should also see le cercle rouge and especially bob le flambeur
there is n't one wasted second in this film not one ! ! ! you 'll be sucked in , and surprised , within the first two minutes , and there 's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading you can tell there 's a lot of influence from american film noir in this film , but le samourai takes it to a level of perfection i wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch le samourai they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done brilliant
spoilers
this is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s jessica lange truly deserved her oscar and tommy lee is excellent and of course powers booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies i ca n't even tell you how many times i have seen this movie and i will watch it again and again

all monty python movies are a must see i think my generation has seen them all i hope the younger generation \( less than 40 \) watch at least one the humor is at many levels , so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing like all good humor , it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general , as well as , politics and religion \( without getting nasty \)
everybody knows the plot of this movie so , i ca n't add anything in that respect however , i can tell you that the quality of the dvd is very good clear picture and sound great buy
a very good film staring cary grant and grace kelly cary plays the part of a retired jewel thief someone begins to steal jewels and the local police think its cary grace plays the part of the daughter of a rich amrican widow the film then covers how cary grants finds the people who have copied his mo a fun romp through the french country side well acted and directed a must see if you are a cary grant or grace kelly fan

what a truly stunning film , this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry , more of these should see the light
this film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters however , its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful , the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences , and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul although i have recommended this film to several people , i caution them that it can be pretty disturbing i thought about it for weeks after i saw it the first time , and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again definitely not a light hearted evening of entertainment
i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very much most of these movies are from the 30 's and 40 's , the hayday of movie mysterys the transfers are ok , but not great and some of the movie have sterotype 's of all kinds just keep in mind when they were made , and if they bother you do n't watch a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio
introduction
well at least its in my top 5 o \) i'm not the biggest chaplin fan more of a keaton and lloyd kinda guy but dang if this movie dose n't do me in everytime i never fail to fall into hysterics over the feeding chair scene or the gibberish song and several other scenes and i always get teary eyed over the plight of charlie and his little love gamin this movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next ! do n't be botherd by the hype about this being a social commentary or a commie film or whatever ! its still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order ! ! now i have this wonderful new 2 disc mk2 version from the chaplin collection box to pull out every christmas holiday season along with city lights as i'm want to do and check out the little cuban documentary on the second disc about the traveling projectionists who take the movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first time the tears in these peoples eyes as they watch tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film
it have a plenty range of glould 's legacy personally i hate the contemporary music , honestly i bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic partita no 6 in e minor it have a rear romatic influence , and definitly it do n't have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957 nonetheless you will see the great personality of glenn and its lively interpretation
if you can get through david 's boot camp video with moderate effort , this video may be a bit too easy for you that said , this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser david does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form he is very encouraging throughout the workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used \( two dumbbells needed \) there are a few innovative moves thrown in as well
i was reading some reviews of the quiet man earlier this year and a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time , entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children , grandchildren and i imagine great grandchildren
this is an outstanding dvd i highly recommend it if you have seen riverdance live you can relive the great moments if you have n't seen riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this dvd from the comfort of your own home
you should see this because it has an eary appearance by america \( yes , peo ple , that is her real name \) ferarra ! ! ! who , you ask \? \? oh \( casually \) only the star of ugly betty \( looks up , says ala pulp fiction \) oh , do i have your attention now \? \? \? \? also in this movie is roary from gg \( gilmore girls for the ignorant \) the only thing i didnt like was the blonde who had sex with the older man , not only was it innapropriate , but also illegal ! ! ! ! wso , parents be aware of this if you 're daughter 's want to watch this movie it has sexual content ! ! ! ! especially if they are under age ! now , peo ple , i am a male and also over 18 so i can watch what i want , but i'm just saying that for young girls they should n't watch this one ! ! ! but we all can watch ugly betty ! ! ! !
i thought this was an excellent coming of age movie very poignant in parts love the soundtrack as well ! these days is an especially beautiful song
for all true dream theater fans , this is a must have dvd ! the only drawback to score that i found was that they did n't play never enough , but that should n't prevent you from purchasing score i have watched the dvd over 10 times already and it has n't gotten old for me
for those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired , all i can say is that you wo n't be disappointed this series is one of my all time favorite tv shows when i discovered it was on dvd i snapped it up right away the picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version i originally saw this is the first tv series i have ordered on dvd and i was afraid the picture quality would be vhs boy was i wrong , this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd i have ever purchased if you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series
my kids just love this movie barbie in the 12 dancing princesses it is a very clean movie it is not scary except for the mean duchess but she really is n't scary , just mean it teaches about honesty and family , and how they care about each other which is really good for children to see plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch
before we first rented one of the barbie videos for my daughter , i was expecting them to be trite , over commercialised , and over sugary however , i have been pleasantly surprised
one of m g ms brightest , cheeriest musical astair and garland are most engaging screen couple the uplifting irving berlin score is first rate and used to perfection strolling along 5th avenue in turn of the century or going on the bum as a couple of swells , judy garland \( 1922 1969 \) and fred astaire \( 1899 1987 \) lead a parade of music 17 \( irving berlin 1888 1988 \) tunes and an academy award winning adaption score arranged by johnny green \( 1908 1989 \) and roger edens \( 1905 1970 \) and gotta dance fun \( including drum drum crazy \) in this neverending delifgt co starring ann miller \( 1923 2004 \) performing a knock out shaking the blues away and peter lawford \( 1923 1984 \) gamely crooning the fella with the umbrella with garland dont let this colorful easter parade pass you ! all new digital transfer from restored picturre and audio elements super tehnicolor and super sound highly recommended
a french coming of age art film that i rented while on vacation despite rave reviews all over the packaging , this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable , even a bit tedious jet lag set in and we gave up two thirds of the way through the film , and took it back the next day in all fairness , this is probably a fine film if you 're in the mood for serious art , but i found it a bit dreary
this is a really scary movie i 've always put ju on on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever , but this movie surpasses that movie i did n't expect much , seeing the title of the movie which does n't sound scary at all , but was i wrong , dead wrong if you are a horror fan , you got to see this movie the terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck asian horror movies do n't rely on gore , but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops contemporary american horror movies do n't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks asian horror movies like this one , which is korean , is not an original idea , but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better other asian titles i recommend are ju on , dark water , and the red shoes
a fun musical comedy , the trouble with girls is n't the usual elvis presley film but it 's completely charming with it 's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast
i really enjoyed this movie death warrant was filled with supense and action jean claude van damme portrays officer louis burke who goes undercover to investigate murder and corruption in the prison system eventually officer burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars
fargo is a very good film the cohen brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film the film stars jerry lundegaard \( william h macy \) as a car salesman in dire need of money when he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom , things go from bad to worse i could n't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers the father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom , and decides to act on his own jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess moreover , he has a saavy police chief \( mcdormand \) on the case
i thought the film was great , it has a interesting storyline it also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on
i did this workout for the very first time today and i do n't think i 've felt ever felt this good about myself this dvd works it 's not high impact aerobics , but i do n't think i 've ever sweat that much in one workout before and i totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy i'm not in very good shape , so i need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout \( i did n't think i 'd like this dvd because it is one of the longer ones ana and ravi put out \) i am really , really looking forward to getting the other two fat free dvds to add to my collection
i think this is a great film many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it 's running time \( 128 minutes \) , insisting it 's too slow almost all of clint 's films \( the ones he 's directed \) run long the running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours \( the longest being bird , at 2 hours , 40 minutes \) sure , the film is n't pc , but it was made in 1975 , when you did n't have to be pc but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic clint did all his own stunts in these sequences , and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences and they are very intense to watch , because you know the actors are really up there no cgi in those days this is one of the reasons they work so well cgi looks fake anyway it makes movies seem like cartoons people know it is n't real cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood , as it takes the tension out of action scenes
recently realizing that jackie chan and jet li are about done with movie making for the most part , i always wondered if there was anyone who could take over chan and li are one of a kind and the best out there fortunately , tony jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own the first thing i like about tony jaa is he is an expert in muay thai fighting , something new and original for the good guy in a movie the next thing i like is that he fights like jet li and does stunts like jackie chan , though once again he adds his own originality quite often
a friend of mine told me about this movie and i went to the local video store and rented it crazy ! ! ! i thought that the cgi and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real however , after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie live ! ! jackie who \? \? \? bruce what \? \? jet whatchamacallit \? \? \? \? he is the martial arts star for the new generation for those that see the decline of martial arts movies , this kid gives us hope
a hilarious movie , made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you 'd find in the object of it 's spoofing , top gun the film is loaded with abrahams 's usual sight gags , puns , slapstick , and quick wordplay there 's always something going on in the background , making for fun repeat viewings the overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience besides that , it 's educational , too ! you 'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is
the product is a1 but why arewe penalised for late delivery in the form of warfage ! ! ! ! ! shurly this is wrong \? \?
this dvd was better than i could have asked for it uses footage from the tv show this week in baseball twib , and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of america 's pastime it goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including tim hudson , ryan dempster , select phillies players , many others , as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as tommy lasorda and yogi berra if you love twib 's how 'bout that section of the show , you will adore this dvd
this is a sad little gem of a movie i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love the story had as much to do with issues of identity , community , and fidelity in my opinion , there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved , especially when considering the quality of the performances the slight quiver in weisz 's voice was right on target as was perez 's accent the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable considering the type of story and the setting , i ca n't help but think that a three part mini series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character
i have watched the first disk of the tick , and i laughed my ass off ! ! i am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to comedy central , and requst that they air the first season on their channel i think that fox screwed up by cancelling this show , and that comedy central should pick it up it is by far the best show i have seen in awhile , and deserves to be resurrected ! ! thank you
i'm the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club i use it 's so bad that my so called friends would n't even go to the range with me anymore because i embarrassed them too much i was the butt of all the jokes at the office too
martin short joins the cast in this volume , securing this show 's enduring genius and originality the cast , brilliant as always , never fail to deliver
tales from the crypt theme music plays , as the camera shoots through a spooky haunted mansion the camera reaches the basement , out pops the crypt keeper with his menacing cackle tales from the crypt this show is one of my all time favorites i used to sit in front of the television with my father every saturday night when this show came on the stories in this show were so amazing and so well done , that i could n't help myself when i became hooked on the show , and i was only four years old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989
visually aurally this is a feast ! great musicianship , excellent lighting , colour , camera angles etc etc if you know like pat know the piece you wo n't be really disappointed but the reason it 's 4 not 5 for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star first , there 's no intro \( the first note is struck with the title screen still showing \) no pictures of the band standing taking the crowd 's ovation \( the credits start rolling straight after the last note \) i always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere , location occasion before and after the music starts playing second , those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary guitar trumpet interplay closing out part two well , i'm not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth great of course but could 've been even better ! this said , 4 for a pat product still means a must buy !
'the bunker' is one of three films that deal with hitler 's final days as the soviets encircle berlin and put an end to the third reich in april may 1945
this is a fantastic video i use it regularly for teaching it gives a wonderful sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist , as well as a glimpse of the other artist 's work who are interviewed in the video it is filmed in a very immediate and personal style there is nothing stiff , boring , or disconnected about it , common faults of many art videos anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck 's event very moving , and not at all sappy
bergman first introduced us to johan and marianne in his 1974 masterpiece scenes from a marriage , one of the cinema 's most exacting dissections of our all too human failure to connect bergman and the splendid scandanavian actors erland josephson and liv ullmann took us through johan and marianne 's marriage , divorce , and post divorce reconciliation in the end , they live apart , but still make room for the bond between them
the enduring legacy around fran ois truffaut 's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from henri pierre roch semi autobiographical novel and in showing that elusive rapport , oskar werner , henri serre and especially jeanne moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the french new wave fortunately , the two disc criterion collection dvd set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic , although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times
i 'll tell ya if i read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing bakshi , i think i'm going to start kicking rump and taking names do people diss disney \? hardly , until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch
trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept they did it in saw ii , house on haunted hill , and then there were none , and i'm sure quite a few others but that plot seems to always work it does for me house of 9 is no exception it does n't follow a storyline that 's predictable , even though the plot is not unknown there are surprises , suspense , thrills and tense moments believe me , you wo n't predict the ending i was very satisfied with the movement of this film it 's an interesting watch
samuel jackson and kevin spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances jackson is always great to watch for his intensity , and this role suits that to a tee spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance this film and its settings supporting cast are slightly dated by today 's standards , but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it highly worthwile
spider man 2 is better than the original spider man i feel i should get that out of the way first , since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one however , i feel spider man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade spider man , it should naturally be better that 's what this sequel feels like , a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there it 's a good film , but it 's not really the way i thought a sequel should be
had just enough tasteful sex to satisfy and oh yes , the movie was good too
old boy is the second film in the revenge trilogy by park the first is sympathy for mr vengeance and the final being sympathy for lady vengeance
an absolutely wonderful film by clint eastwood thelonious was an amazing man he said things on the piano that we wordsmiths are n't able to communicate his unusual character made for an interesting subplot this film is footage of the man himself , usually playing his music i'm just sitting here being stunned
the thin man movies were funny and sophisticated when they came out and remain so it seems rare today to find such rich dialogue
anchor bay has come through again with this wonderful set of paul verhoeven 's early films all of the transfers are top notch and the subtitles are very clear and concise as the individual titles have already been reviewed seperately , the big draw to this collection is being able to collect all of these brilliant films for much less than their retail price the collectible booklet that 's included provides plot summaries and quotes from the director and or cast member \( s \) overall , i highly recommend this collection for even the casual filmgoer who is looking for that unique film experience
great acting and development in the multi linear plot movie very heavy movie however , that may be out of some people 's reach as to understanding and appreciation strisand and nolte were both brilliant
the tale starts out with a historical reference to chaucer for a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected and then you see the michael powell and emeric pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid evil times to present day \( 1944 \) england
this documentary is very concise , and very straight forward it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir it features interviews with some very credible sources , all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together this documentary makes a great point and i 'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics
one of the best movies i have seen ! ! ! the subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal' boundaries after watching this movie , you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does
monty python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever they made a tv show , monty python 's flying circus , and several hilarious movies
we have both of these , although we purchased them seperately save yourself the time and money and just get them together the magical halloween adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides , pumpkin patches , carving pumpkins and making cider there is a cute songs about monsters not being scary the elmo says boo ! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has elmo all over it we have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that in my opinion , they are not scary also , we watch them year round especially the elmo one she will pull it out and ask for it who knew you could have halloween in july \? \?
i spent ten years working various scenes at the trinity church hellhouse yes , it is a bit campy , and yes , it is often over the top , but i can say that the people are well intentioned , just a bit off target i attended trinity church from birth until i was 22 years old i do not attend their anymore because of the close minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary i stopped doing hellhouse when they added the decision room my last year i just felt it was an un biblical scare tactic i now feel that way about the entire operation the worst feeling i get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves i know because i was once one of them i have found that a growing number of former trinity youth group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons i listed above this movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist christian churches
this is a movie you 'll want to watch over again a number of times for a number of reasons for one , you 'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go round \( perhaps the second and third go round , too , and even beyond \) as the legend goes , with the exception of a few brief , well timed breathers , director howard hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film 's sleek 92 minutes , with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once
i do n't usually like romance films , but 2046 is brilliant !
i have ever seen what to say for this film great acting , great story and great music do n't hesitate go get it this will be one of the gems in your movie collection
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame , i love a good suspense horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
if you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child , pass on this one this movie has so many drug references , i ca n't even begin to explain \( trust me , i just so happen to have taken acid before \) this is a movie that never should have been directed toward children
fun to watch but my 9 1 2 yr old daughter could not follow the moves neither could i for that matter we tried to learn the moves through breaking it down but there is just not enough repetition too complicated
every review i 've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and i just do n't get it no one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it , and by then you 're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters , it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next if you like extremely broad slapstick humor and find that totally charming , then i guess i can see the appeal everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases i have to wonder what they could be damned melon ! or i passed out when i broke my wrist , and when i woke up , the cast was already on ! \? \? \? i will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor , because they say completely different things , or omit speech altogether in sum , do n't waste your time
the acting was very good the pace was adequate however , the plot was predictable the movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome clive 's character kept calling this the perfect robbery the characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters ca n't possibly know what is going on i'm still not sure what jody foster 's character brings to the plot
wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself , wo n't enjoy two womanizers fall in love , one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin , like first off , what does virginity have to do with love \? second , who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin \? then owen wilson 's character fall in love with rachel 's mcadams character and well , that 's the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it 's not that funny it seems to think it 's better then it is i do n't think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course , because it 's this kind of film , he ends up being gay and of course , he tries to hit on vince vaughn 's character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay guy is prob one of the worst actors i 've seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell , alot of people i know find this guy so funny but i do n't get it it just was n't funny to me u know , i loved the classic , american pie that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy ! this film was n't so much funny as stupid for the most part , i'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it 's just an average film
it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology , from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification this is a very dull , shapeless , stilted movie i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds , but since it is above all a piece of propaganda , i'm compelled to condemn it as history what it presents is the war between the states version of the civil war , in which the gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills and dales , their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north there are only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters otherwise , slavery is beside the point the generalship of lee and jackson , of course , is idolized , while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools the battle scenes are perfectly predictable guys charge on foot , other guys shoot , the fields are littered with bodies would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting \? how real is it to show only one train , and that southern , in a war won more by transportation than by musketry \? if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession , if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing about slavery by william lee miller , a professor at the university of virginia it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives , over slavery , in the 1830s , twenty five years before the election of lincoln the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought , and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides , blue and grey
maybe for some people , to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal , but in matt sullivan 's case , it could be a total nightmare
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
editorial reviews
i'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really was n't much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap you 'd expect from a family friendly movie , though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just does n't do comedy all that well , at least for a lead role jame garner , the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character
this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen its not sad its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96' but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television
i was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and ghibli studios previous works all the greater the disappointment then , when less than half way through , the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original , several key characters are lumped together most confusingly , and others lose all their complex charm what a shame
along with the nanny , the stepdad , the cable guy , the 14 year old girl with a crush we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes , everyone is out to get us or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe
well , i sure could have skipped this one i well remember the critics raving over this on television , but why is beyond me mostly , i was just plain bored there simply was no depth at all , just bunches of short takes and wise cracks bush was just downright dirty , making insults and slurs all over the place , something i do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be president and it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that mary matalen , the deputy manager of bush 's campaign and very acid tongued \( maybe she wrote some of the slurs bush used \) , is now the wife of james carville , top strategist for clinton 's campaign , and basically the star of the movie but all the scenes were focused on the funny quip , the bon mot , no long scenes of the nitty gritty work , or any answers to any questions about clinton either , for that matter
so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing
from start to finish a total waste of time i viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman , we were all appalled at how desparate this pamela was note to the director not all women waiting on god are that desparate the so called christian principals in this movie were laughable at the end of the movie i found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time
this movie was so horrible i do n't know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly , i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi christian plays , why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore , i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery fornication this movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of god if you 're in love in fact , christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice by even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where ce ce peniston 's character says seductively , i'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus yet she 's dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing , why did ce ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she 's dressed one way , by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition , the soundtrack , it was just annoying at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly , it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate \( although some are \) however , having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just , well , almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall , this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity
this has got to be one of the worst , most unrealistic movies to date i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks rarely are they done well this one , however , takes it to a whole new level what was courtney love thinking \? !
this movie did n't do anything for me did n't care for the characters or the plot the ending was disapointing also
cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today
this dvd gives documentary coverage concerning such da vinci code topics as rosslyn chapel , the priory of scion , the knights templar , the gnostic gospels , le dossier secrets , da vinci paintings , and opus dei
i saw this at the library and brought it home , thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the 1950 's , but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable , and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran , we did n't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography , and for the most part it seemed like the costumes , hair , way of speaking , etc were accurate for the time period \( so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when \) but something just was n't quite right , and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children , because of the nudity
i'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming , but i feel ripped off just the same
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement , highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and , conversely , what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica \( kim basinger \) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery 1 what is it \?
this is the worst transfer of a movie \( that is not a tape to tape before dvd bootleg \) that i have ever seen many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights , or so it appears , and lines dance around with the sound it was so bad i thought it was in individual damaged dvd , until i read other reviews here and on imdb
i unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time this was the best of them the others were pure wastes of money while this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point if you 've seen what the bleep dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds
wow ! practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and woo woo sounding phrases , change your voice , and you , too , can be a channeler ! for money ! i'm definitely in the wrong occupation has anybody ever thought to question ramtha on a few specifics that a 35 , 000 year old being from atlantis should know \? did ramtha 's ancient society speak indian accented english \? what an amazing stroke of luck ! what did ramtha 's people do for agriculture and diet , how was his her society structured , what tools did they use , and where was atlantis precisely located \? i'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia or how many years precisely , and in what reckoning \? could ramtha show us some writing samples in atlantean script \? linguists could help here or is it just possible that jz knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we want and need to believe \? is n't that a more realistic explanation \? what does that say about those who buy into this \?
even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the true story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess \( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character \)
this is the worst workout tape that i have ever purchase , the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do i am personally gonna smash my copy of it only reason i gave it 1 star is because the ratings dont go lower
maybe because i did n't like porco everything was sub par for me animation is definitely not as good as his later movies not enough weirdness , tried too much for the plot everything was just too ho hum as if he tried to carry the whole movie on porco 's shoulders but once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and porco was a pig there was n't anything else there
i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police aspect and less on the science , which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle
this was not very good , in my opinion the ring scared the bejeezus outta me this was not scary two weeks afterwards , i still find my mind wandering about one thing why the heck did n't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room \? if i walk into my house and see a half naked boy meowing and hissing at me , i'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief , i had a very hard time doing so with this movie this movie was just plain stupid they should have kept this film story in the states once everything moves over to tokyo , the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i have n't seen in a long time i would have respected the film 1 , 000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan
i'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon , due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it , and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all , this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back
many of these shorts on this dvd \( as well as the other dvd 's in this series \) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these dvd 's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you 'll see on the cartoons
this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25 postitive and 75 negative
considering the sensational cast \( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy and brock peters \) , the euro western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot , ace high is a major disappointment the plot is uninvolving and incoherent , the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style , the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife after the first ten minutes , i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it a boring 120 minute piece of junk , ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series save your fistful of dollars for a better film
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of martha
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been material for vh1 's the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film , television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple , and when she does have more than 3 lines at once , the complete lack of feeling , expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile , like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang nails that is all i can say , i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again

normally i love documentaries i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all however , outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
con express has lots of action in it , which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately , the action is n't enough , and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs , the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality , so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this , i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is , for the most part , pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted , but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over the top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , and speed if you liked those , you probably wo n't mind this one too much just go easy on it
i was trying to think of the best short description of what this is sure it 's a propaganda film but that does n't mean much to most people however , most people have seen attack ads around election time that 's what this is , a very long political attack ad , full of all the things we commonly see in such ads distortions , sarcasm , scary close ups , mood music , mocking tone , glaring omissions , out of context quotes , etc
the dvd for the golden coach is for the most part fine , but the final minutes , which are crucial to the full impact of the film , are ruined by deplorable mastering the scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening i believe criterion made some kind of mastering error , because martin scorsese 's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film criterion should withdraw the dvd and offer a replacement
i was very disappointed with steve's performance eventhough it took a lot out of him to refrain from swearing , his material towards the end of the show began to dwindle to the point that it just became plain ignorant , especially in the part where he was expressing how he would kill someone , etc , and gloating bout it after i bought it , i later caught it on a cable network god may not be through with him yet , but it will be up to him \( steve \) to repent on his own this may be good humor for a more complacent christian audience
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time but now it is over , definitely i disliked this novel , and the movie is obnoxious rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently , in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one \( why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies \? \)
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not , having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much touted play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , is colossal torture , like status elipticus it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up , that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums do n't take my word for it , watch it yourself and see
susan ward , coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv , gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures , it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward , then give this a movie a try , if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future , don t find it here
i ordered these , and several other movies from the tyler perry collection , only to find that they were not actual movies but on stage plays i returned them and was charged a high restocking fee not ok ! no where in the description was mention of them being stage plays i will order my cd 's and dvd 's from another source in the future
this is a pure rip off from the cover of aerosmith 's live bootleg album from 1978 where 's the shame \? too bad twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover
shame on talented actors like maura tierney and jerry orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it star co writer john romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time , and this is his only film , and i can see why he plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by tierney , who also works in a local factory run by orbach dennis christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator and june lockhart and lyle waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as tierney 's estranged parents the movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it 's so shoddily included , it makes no statement at all
cesar milan , the so called 'dog whisperer' , bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status , and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it
i agree , these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason , they are not that good ok , there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying i love charlie murphy and the ashy guy and i think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny dave , come back to tv
the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects , making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs , on which the sound is perfect , so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd
this review is more about the superbit transfer of the movie to dvd than the movie itself the movie itself is great and i highly recommend it
i got nothing to say was this supposed to be intense \? was this supposed to be a thriller \? it was boring horrible acting , except for forest whitaker but even he could n't save this one pure fincher \? pure trash horrible , horrible , horrible quite possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i am just too upset to type , i ca n't believe i actually waisted my time with this
terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue , it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid
the film deserves 5 stars but the dvd only gets 1 why no letterbox format after waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on dvd , why would they give us full screen pan scan \? yes , the quality and color are great but oh , what we 're missing on the sidelines
many people had reccomended this movie to me but it failed to live up to its reputation the quality of the film making was aweful , the acting bad to the point of utter ridiculousness , and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers it gets some credit toward the end for showing some self awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was there were some cute moments , and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big l word ladies , but do n't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product
i love leslie nielsen , but this movie is not funny his better movies are wrongfully accused and the naked gun movies
the hospital as well crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean spirited one i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's network and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness i'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole if george c scott 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding , drinking , or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant \? diana rigg is completely wasted in this film her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini skirt and be ravaged by scott 's character the film is also not helped by the lead footed direction of arthur hiller the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years ago thanks to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family , each of whom is brilliantly cast i have series 3 4 and now want 1 2 do n't wait any longer , 24 episodes of absolute delight await you
betty hutton has a colossal amount of energy she seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining she 's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers her voice is sturdy , durable , indestructible
i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob , the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense , few laughs , and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more
michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great b movies as this , q , and it 's alive 3 island of the alive how awesome is he \? \? anyways , i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously , thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you should n't because not only is this a b movie , but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that \? \? i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie , just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth , do n't be too critical on it
i love jeff goldblum , but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck ! \) and the ridiculous , lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) , the storyline , and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better
i am a big fan of frank miller 's work and i loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from when i saw this film i was blown away by the visuals it had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything i had seen in a movie before
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book i'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning , that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny , not scary , and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns , do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit , but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world dont even rent this , i dont even know why you are considering the film
i read some good reviews about this movie in adition , i respect french 's cinema , they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies so , i bought spanish apartment
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school they also discover that they have been cheating on one another the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters i would have expected better from these two
for several reasons apparently , the other online reviewers are extremely over analytical in their critiques of this film the dvd 's jacket has a quote from rolling stone think 'sex and the city' with men ! well , i say , think again as an avid watcher of sex and the city , this film has little if any comparison to satc firstly , this film is not a comedy there were very small instances when i kind of chuckled , but could barely muster a real laugh actually , towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that i kept hitting fast forward on the remote \( those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what i mean here ! \) the characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person 's life these disjointed glimpses do n't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters yes , they are all bored whether they are in their 30 's or their 50 's yes , they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs i usually enjoy movies with this breaking away from boredom type of plot for example pane e tulipani \( bread and tulips \) , facing windows \( also starring giovanna mezzogiorno and a much better film \) , under the tuscan sun , shirley valentine , a month by the lake , etc the last kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do , however the viewer is left with no warm feelings about life 's decisions , only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film
i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004 i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie , but it was really lackluster
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius , he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro , awesome ! hoffman , awesome ! streisand , awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless , and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie , these a 1 actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film , and i recommend it to every and anyone to see , but wear your depends , because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya 99 , you do n't know what in the friggin' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an anti social loser , that complains about going out to the movies \? stay home , i'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
this truly is a horrible movie 7 seconds , huh , yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it the acting is horrible , the plot is horrible , the filming is horrible everything is horrible ! i was hopeful because of snipes , which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie ! snipes could n't even do the fight scenes and make them look real the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love ! huh , they were a romantic interest \? they hinted at it , but never showed this happening
i loved the original movie , and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome wrong wrong wrong ! ! first of all , the child actors were horrible , well the charlie and mike characters were ok , but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp \? he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater , and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
the books are witty and charming this , in stark contrast , is formulaic schlock americans and much of the world 's consumers prefer their entertainment predigested so it does n't require chewing , so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly
when i purchased this dvd , i was hoping to get the complete picture an unbiased presentation from scratch i could sense what was to come bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this dvd it is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted what little was discussed appeared to be very tainted
though i'm still a big south park fan , i do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons this season has its standouts , most notably the truly demented christmas critters episode , but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes
i hear this is a good movie , but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged so what about quality control \? this disc should never have gotten out the door , but the odd thing is , i ordered 2 dvd 's from amazon different titles , both damaged are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us \? f
i usually trust amazon reviewers on movie reviews , but this time no way ! this silly , totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment , hoping the movie would liven up sadly , it did n't to those who rave about the film you must be in another dimension or something thumbs down
i liked the shows when the 1st ran on tv the unrated did n't quite live up to my expectations
another product of hollywood 's karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind , we have in u 571 an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war , we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting , camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies \( german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors \) and absurd scenarios \( an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit \) put this ridiculous movie in its own category u 571 is just another thin , over promoted , throw away movie you 'll forget the day after you see it
sat down and saw this one on televion
sure , this movie is a classic but is it any good \? frankly , i found it to be tedious in the extreme
not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special , but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which anti homosexual groups been touting for years if you 're thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship , do n't the lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end
the shows themselves are wonderful , but the people who put together this dvd set should be ashamed of this paltry effort ! there are no cast or staff interviews about the ending of such a wonderful series no commentaries no english sub titles no john spencer honorarium of any kind they did n't even take the time to include the 1 hour re showing of the original pilot they aired before the finale ! the only extras are two not special at all special features dealing with the debate this dvd set is definately not worth the money to buy it brand new
unfortunately this ms collection is not compatible with european dvd players the cover of the dvd actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the us and canada' save yourself a lot of trouble and do n't buy this if you are from the eu !
cheesy instructor
i have always like denise austin , however this was tape was way too fast for a beginner i thought it was for beginner and on up denise went way to fast and she did not explain the poses at all i will not be using this tape i was disappointed because normally i love her videotapes and her
i hated this movie so unrealistic sure , maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating but i am a teenager in a city nobody acts like this !
margarett mitchell must be rolling in her grave she wrote a masterpiece in the 1930 's , then alexandra ripley bought the rights to her book by conning margaret mitchell 's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative alexandra ripley 's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush , even worse than a barbara courtland romance novel
i 've loved this movie ever since i saw it on cbs years ago so i was really excited to own it on dvd unfortunately the experience was ruined when i discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene i was very dissapointed
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)
the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened do n't even buy it , it is a waist of your money
whatever ills are in the world , it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one sided and totally non objective movie for example , instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work , they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and , if they chose that job freely , it must be their best option , no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise , as opportunities increase over time \( by having more corporations and not less , to create more competition for these people 's labor \) , and as the country becomes wealthier , these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact , the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where anti child labor laws , at the urging of the un , turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs , as sad as it may be , were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process , but all the industrialized nations went through that process government mandated shortcuts usually produce results which are even worse however , the results speak for themselves in very short period of time , for example , hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china , india and around the world thanks for the evil capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also , cost of living is very low there , so these pennies really can go a long way , do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people \? i guess to let people starve to death , then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! \? other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes , and may act like a separate being as far the law in concerned , but does a corporation have a nose , feet , stomach \? can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis \? of course , not , than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it \? \? several of the main spokepersons in the movie , chomsky , michael moore , rifkin and others are renowned for their off the wall comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie , you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie , you 're basically bombarded by one sided arguments with very little of the other side presented , despite the director 's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1 2 1 2 , it 's more like 80 20 \) just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid , they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes \( hey , let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! \) , dvd players , or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need \? chomsky , of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want , according to him he says that you should do more important things , like perhaps studying lingistics \( which he teaches but which very few care about \) the movie does make some correct and good observations , especially regarding polution , however , i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess , just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie , it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples , how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the u s government do so many things for private companies with public funds \? just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies , forbid government corporate welfare of any kind , forbid subsidies to companies , cut the suffocating red tape and regulation \( esp in developing countries but in the west too \) , cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 \( and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing , give people all around the world a better life , increase competition , etc \) if these and other governments \( and not corporations' \) problems were eliminated , the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile \( spoken about with much admiration \) , people with no understanding about economics , how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it the dvd we just purchased was horrible they chopped out so much of the movie it made it un watchable it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
she 's built like a 12 year old boy give me vida guerra anyday
i was thrilled when i first read that mlb productions was finally issuing a dvd version of highlights of the baltimore orioles' three world series victories i already owned the vhs versions , one of which \( the 1970 world series \) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization \( watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film \) finally , i could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 world series
the movie directors in the me , particularly iranians , are responding to demands by the west for certain type of movies they produce what is demanded from them in turn , they receive awards cultural industry empowers these demands they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded there is no single me movie which depict the story of western imperialism in the me and then awarded for doing so me movies must show that me women are in need of emancipation me cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized civilization itself is presented in vertical sense there is a civilization somewhere out there all measterners are expected to reach yet , it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them \( no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country who deprived them of education and knowledge the west is represented by beautiful , blonde nurses , a nice american guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his everyday western knowledge of medicine in the midst of total ignorance , and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs such a nice way to civilize ! \)
in the film commentary , director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying , 'i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it ' \( that 's a paraphrase \) and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad the director did n't know what it was about
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces , but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased , and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information pre 9 11 and post 9 11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond , we are truly in trouble the truth is out there , and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd , but this dvd is maybe worth a glance , but not a long hard look
this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing , the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny , and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee , another movie with a fast talking , potty mouthed , black guy \( hello eddie murphy \) who , because it 's perfectly fine in ultra lib , pc hollyweird , calls charlie sheen \( and everyone else who is not black \) a host of nasty , racially oriented names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist \( tucker \) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop killer , is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a co star , but like most of his other movies , he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter hey bob , what will we have tucker do next \? hey i know , let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names second screenwriter hey , great idea fred , i sure do n't have any ideas apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip off of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor , i pity you
this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly , painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses
i have only one question about this movie and that is , why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book \?
first of all , 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks second of all , i missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain also , regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises , it is still moderately difficult
saw this as an inflight movie boy , did i pray for engine trouble , so we 'd have to land and i could get away ! sucks or what \? i liked smith in 'i , robot' , 'independence day' , etc , but this was awful it 's a one joke movie problem is , the one joke was the one plastered all over the tv spots and trailers \( the jet ski incident \) the highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool wish that 'd been the main storyline instead far , far superior ! will not be adding this to my wishlist
i cannot get thru this one i started fast forwarding but there did n't appear to have any good spots when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this , i thought , this has to be good i had just finished a movie where he starred ca n't remember the name of it i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it tori spelling is well known , but not to me someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start she does not play a flake very well , and i do n't know what to call her except a flake i stopped this dvd in about the first 1 2 hour and will go back and give it another shot , but with tori spelling as one of the leads , i already know this one does not have a prayer i would say save your money on this one unless you are under 13 i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that do n't this one falls into this category one that came with this one was the broken hearts club and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage
the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus , everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something
wow it 's rare i consider a movie absolutely horrendous , but this one qualifies we are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy , and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie , i found myself yelling die already when he does n't kill himself in the end , all i wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him a dumb stupid awful indie movie that is a waste of film , time and effort
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly , his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with ice t mcginly 's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world , he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast \( which included hacks like paul rudd \) was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and ice t who have graced some of his previous work please sean , stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff , leave that to idiots like capra , wenders , scorcese etc they are not in your league
i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good
saw the previews of the first movie , but i was n't expecting too much from that i tried to finish both the first and the second , but that did n't work out too well i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie , and that includes the first all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this a has been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer , down on his luck the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property , and hides his car trying to escape a finance co the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine in one early scene they have a funeral , casket and all , for a monkey yuk
i just opened a box with a cesar millan book and this dvd imagine my surprise i do n't like the pairing of this book with cesar 's stuff either ! now i have an extra errand and cost to ship back if anything like this ever happens again , there are other sites to order from online i do n't want it to be too much work to browse and study the copy i feel a bit cheated
director gary fleder
what is the deal cant hollywood leave well enough alone how many classic animated movies are they going to ruin with sequels \? let me think , their was balto 2 , little mermaid 2 , aladdin 2 and three , secret of nimh 2 , land before time 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 etc enough already next thing you know they 'll be making a lion king 2 , and a buity and the beast 2 o wait , they already did that did n't they all the movies i have named were great originals but god awful sequels adgth 2 is just as bad if you loved the original , stay away from its sequal
this movie is one of cinema history 's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success saturday night fever from a few years before is another example , but that movie could actually stand on its own jennifer beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside , i do n't think this one could
believe it or not , i actually wanted to watch this movie i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then
this is a remake of an affair to remember with cary grant and deborah and it does not work some movies just should not be remade the only thing good about this movie is katharine hepburn 's appearance get the original
first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan therefore , i tried to like this really , i did
talentless people and garbage music torture you in this turkey in no time flat , you 'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! out into the yard do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense
man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs old , but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book i'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning , that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
i went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of northern america having only really seen pocahontas through the eyes of disney , i felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events
the new world is the least of terrence malick 's limited filmography to date , and could be best described as a monotone poem it 's not exactly bad , just mundane and rather forgettable even while you 're watching it , more of a self indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired , while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s p o k e n v e r y s l o w l y i n h u s h e d t o n e s against selections from his classical music collection , which does n't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific colin farrell , a nice enough lad offscreen i'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he 's given true to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions the bambi caught in the headlights of an oncoming car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he 's not been getting enough roughage in his diet the fact that he 's outshone by q'orianka kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy , although to be fair he has been worse indeed , among the male leads christian bale does much , much more with much , much less in the last third of the film , as does a typically underused christopher plummer in the first third
me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films and we do really like the thin red line but this was a real boring piece of film making the whole film was just one huge poetry reading and i prefer to read poetry from a book it just does n't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by george lucas even the battle scenes were just poetry readings watch thin red line instead if you are interested in this director 's work that film is a masterpiece this is n't
this movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of christian bale and colin farrell to date it was boring , overblown and incessantly long it 's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better , but it never does and then it just ends do n't waste the time or the money
off hand , i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey , he 's making a buck , here \) that 's all 1 32 star , if possible
i never received product as they never shipped it amazon sent me an email stating that they could n't complete my order as it was non deliverable not sure what that means if every other item i purchase is deliverable
this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version
before i review , i 'd like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim , ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show , and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie , which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name , \( which i have not read , so i do n't know which is more accurate \) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way
it 's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film how could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy \? if this film is considered groundbreaking then i fear for our republic
am i the only one who found the basic workout difficult \? the pace was too quick for me to get the right technique in the poses and even though i have done this workout several times now , my back almost always is very painful for at least 24 hours afterward i have found that , apart from a few exercises , the intermediate workout is easier
i will not watch the movie andersonville until they make a movie called elmira \( the camp in elmira , n y , the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate \)
i gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore , but choose not to one the other hand , rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone
therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain
stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic not one single fact about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film i had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won what a crock
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his her dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his her mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich \? do we wait until then to change the moral \? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music , making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me , god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !
who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm \? chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too , although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies \? they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters this movie was somewhat good , but it did n't feel all that great so far , this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra , the incredible hulk , xmen 3 , daredevil , and the punisher i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies , but after seeing what hollywood does to them , i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding special effects were good in this movie , and so was the story michael chiklis as the thing was great , and his the thing character makeup was done very well , and he played the character well too , as did ioan gruffud with mr fantastic jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie
the central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920 's robin hood and his band of gangsters unfortunately , even the rat pack cannot save this movie the script is slow , dated , and dull barbara rush 's scenes are especially confusing her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie nothing comes of her apparent interest in sinatra or martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut the main actors seemed to be bored , and with the exceptions of bing crosby and peter falk , walked through their performances \( maybe they were hung over most of the time \? \)
well folks , looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here \( crash comes close , but that film has a lot more detractors than this one , and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined , somehow , that it would change the world \) my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse , nor do i find it overly depressing fact is , it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying , sometimes at different moments , sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film , against my better judgement still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend a streetcar named desire , kids , last exit to brooklyn , and traffic
the only reason why i saw this was because of susannah york this shows she was more capable of the dix she played in the killing of sister george and was a fine actress otherwise this movie is blah it 's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting the men in this movie are so disgusting one ca n't blame her for getting mad anyway for another pointless film of this caliber see secret ceremony
he thought the columbine incident was about gun control it was not it was about anger and bullying that is the problem that is what would have fixed that problem we need to help children be better to eachother or problems like this will keep going on it is worth seeing because it is interesting , but he is wrong on this one micahel moore is a good director but people are not always right
you want realism of the old west \? try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they did n't have tissues try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair , and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste , so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black
ok , the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long \? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters
i hate lawyers
okay , the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen , but i like the actors \( especially ben 's best man \) so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot , such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones \? or at least , why do n't they use them \? oh no , much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee , he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up \? and uh , they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gonna get busted \?
simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin \( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince \( why \? \) \) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so , a kid dies , which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around , why , no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship
i rented this dvd because of the glowing reviews here and because i wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the middle east overall , i was disappointed by this offering because it did n't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject \( it also seems to me to be a bit biased in israel 's favor vis a vis the palestinians , but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately \)
other reviews rant about ms judd frankly , after double jeopardy and high crimes , i'm not seeing the superb actress , but that 's aside the point this movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else search for truth , not innocence especially if you are an attorney
ashley judd 's \( normal life , the locusts \) husband , played by jim caviezel \( the passion of the christ , frequency \) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in el salvador a bunch of years ago so , judd hires the always superb morgan freeman \( unleashed , million dollar baby \) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment judd then has threats on her life after the opening sequence pulls you in , the thrills are a mixed bag \( car crash scene for example was good \) and the outcome , well , i really saw coming anyway ashley judd 's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband \( double jeopardy \) twisted and kiss the girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin also starring bruce davison \( x men , dahmer \) , amanda peet \( the whole nine yards , the whole ten yards \) and tom bower \( die hard 2
funny and very inspirational good way to encourage young teenagers to build self esteem if there 's a will , there 's a way anyone can dance
i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film , against my better judgement still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend a streetcar named desire , kids , last exit to brooklyn , and traffic
ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film
these plays were okay , i'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice , the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre \( definitely no tyler perry quality on that note \) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he did n't
in good company goes on and on at the end a little bit , and the ending especially is not fulfilling character plot wise if it had ended 15 20 minutes before it actually did , i would give it three stars instead of two
i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring , i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever rea
the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far fetched , it is actually completely false the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered \( or is otherwise the victim \) , but what you did , in distinct criminal incidents even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone , if you go back and murder them again then that is a new incident , and double jeopardy does not apply
this show deserved to get cancelled , and there 's a very simple reason this is supposedly dry , subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry , subtle comedy it 's a show that was presented to the fox audience , an audeince that normally likes the most inane , low brow kind of humor , that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it
four brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story , reeking of artificiality , features mark wahlberg , tyrese gibson , andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery , the quartet launches into action , seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced , through their investigation in the neighborhood , that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe
i do not understand what the hype about this dvd is i baught it according to reviews , but unfortunatly , was very dissapointed i def felt a burn in my upper abs , but you are laying on your back the entire time there is no changing positions and targeting the abs from diferent angles to me , it was basically crunch after crunch after crunch would not recommend it unless you want buldge in your upper abs
while i 've been a big fan of ghost in the shell , these stories are the worst yet \( i 've watched the first three episodes on cartoon network as the dvd is not out yet \)
personally , i found this workout extremely difficult to follow the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand , i grew frustrated other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition , as i have obviously tried , but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill , both of which i believe are integral to any workout and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output one should n't have to teach themselves the moves
thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low budget
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes , then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what 's up with that
the movie title itself says a lot , the movie itself is a total scam , fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing , script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie
strengths soundtrack by christopher franke , performance by andreas katsulas in 1st half interesting idea of weapons system
denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults this video is n't kid friendly , and does n't have a good feel for kids to be honest , it is very close to most of denise 's exercise videos for adults what denise has forgotten , or may have never known , is kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly , and that means with exercise videos to
sixth sense unbreakable are so much better than signs , and i'm sorry to say whatever m night shyamalan originally had , he 's lost when sixth sense came out , he was tipped as the next big thing , but i'm sorry to say , it 's no longer there in my mind , he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of sixth sense
i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a middle aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life , so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor , a crush is pursued , a wife gets jealous , hires a detective , and gasp his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie , just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual , which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end , besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance never had contestants who mastered it
i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored , i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking , and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said , oh , it was okay but did n't elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny , with jokes or punchlines that fell flat , horrible acting , totally predictable , and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you 're really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then , you 'd be better off to go home empty handed there 's not even much eye candy to recommend , which is a nice fallback if there 's nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling just because you like a movie should n't mean you give it 5 stars , especially when it 's as bad as this one i mean , i liked freddy vs jason , but there 's no way i 'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars this is bottom of the barrel
as an environmental scientist , i find these soft science hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful while they rally the convinced , having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful to wit , about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage
dull , dull , dull
\( it is really random the selection they used as you hardly have a great cage match in every choice and for the millionth time that wwe lies to us , snuka backlund was not 1980 ! it was june 28 , 1982 ! the date they claim from 1980 was backlund patera in a texas death match a company with that much money has no excuse for such a continous screw up ! snuka was not working for vince sr in 1980 , he was in the nwa feuding with ric flair as part of gene anderson 's stable ! \)
being a fan of cesar , i expected something new and informative
the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow , tepid , and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie , i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great \( i 'll try and remember that next time \) the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward , you 'll know what i mean when it happens , the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere , very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it , happy viewing
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently , i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought , ok , i did n't see the whole thing , it might have gotten better , so i 'll give it another chance bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what \? that 's about as boring as this movie so why the 1 star markup \? cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen , of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the rings and i do like viggo i did not , however , like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried , never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap , watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time
i have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the kids channels i was hoping the dvd would show each of his songs as they are performed on tv instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons this would have been a better cd instead of a dv
it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame
susan ward , coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv , gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures , it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward , then give this a movie a try , if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future , don t find it here
i was really looking forward to this , i 've seen cheap trick live , and they really put on a good show i do n't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio it is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse muffled audio , and underpowered vocals i have a 5 1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert dvd that i 've ever heard i'm giving it 2 stars because i think it was a good show to see live \( if you were there \) , but the audio quality \( or lack of it \) ruined it for me
let me start off by saying that i have higher degrees in art , art history , music , and romance languages so i am an admitted art snob having said that , i would recommend that you try the baby einstein baby van gogh , world of colors and baby mozart videos instead of this brainy baby video
the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
my friend bought this set and so i was able to view it before purchasing it myself , and i won't be purchasing it i had seen the long , long trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies i have ever seen one of those films where you ca n't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do we enjoy most of the i love lucy series , but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows the aggrivating ones , and this film was just an overly long aggrivating i love lucy episode there is funny humor and aggrivating humor and this was definitely the 2nd type
i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too to this day , i pray i do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average mexican american again as a mexican american who has worked hard to take the right road in life , i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race \? prison sex \? babies drinking beer \? young kids doing a drive by \? mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa \? please ! ! ! ! wake up mexicans americans ! we need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message what message \? that doing the things shown in this movie are bad \? i think we knew that already ! what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made , it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful p s let us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual \( s \) out there who found the movie offensive edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie adios amigos ! ! !
i watched about fifeteen minutes before i got enough it was so un biblical it was insulting besides that , it 's a bore
maybe it 's just me , but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production \( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film \) , with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker , but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest , either \( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie \) if you are an alan rickman fan , chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly , alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned , the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star \? sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood , killing , and the like it was totally historically inaccurate , and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow , without even aiming the canon , he knocks his 'friend' off his horse

this straight to video 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison , this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion however , leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off , \( though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around \) , and there 's a torture scene , \( modeled on the one in lethal weapon \) , in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks mr thomas' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell
pinocchio 24 50
and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake the narritor 's voice was monotone i wanted to shout at his pompous , snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples with the narritor , granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko when you take people on a educating journey \( such as nine hours long \) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying check please
i was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between the gospel and the fighting temptations i would not recommend purchasing you are better off renting
i 've been waiting for this season , literally , for years it contained \( notice the past tense \) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show it was in the emergency clinic in the episode my sister , my sitter where the scene pans around showing the patients smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down when i first saw that , many years ago , i literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like i needed a padded room she did n't even understand the joke when i explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of hiding the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable this dvd cut has been cut and makes smithers reply about not letting lisa ahead of him make no sense one of my favorite things about the simpsons was that they did n't care who they offended well they went pc and now i'm highly offended ! if they had n't messed with it i would give them 5 stars , or more realistically i would n't have bothered to write this review quit tampering with the show , fox ! !
please think this dvd is recorded in 1986 more worse , this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of company \( same , worst sound quality documentary \) , i suspect the word concert or soundtrack in dvd title
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of martha
dull , dull , dull
how high is a film that lends nothing , i repeat , nothing to the film community at large i have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the cheech chong of the new millennium with the redman method man pairing while most seem to agree that this is a horrible film , very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be when i use the word racist , i mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich s that african americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society while there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring , what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing method man and redman must be to both the film community , but also to their own culture i have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films , but this one left my jaw on the floor several times the blatant swings at african american stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director jesse dylan , but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film nothing was original nothing was exciting
i'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia i had not seen this movie as a child those that say it 's faithful to the book must have read something other than lewis carroll 's alice however , the kitsch value is considerable cheezy music and costumes , pure 1985 that being said , the jabberwock was pretty cool in that godzilla man in the rubber suit sort of way also , the set design was very handsome it 's too bad that the lighting technology of the time could n't have been more varied everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional the film that comes closest to tenniel 's original alice illustrations is the 1933 paramount b w version it 's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on turner classics
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which , i guess , is the point
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces , but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased , and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information pre 9 11 and post 9 11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond , we are truly in trouble the truth is out there , and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd , but this dvd is maybe worth a glance , but not a long hard look
a tribute is defined as a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude , respect , or admiration that is what you have here
well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy or out of the ordinary or made by that great director its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless
having been a teenager once , i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however , in pump up the volume , the movie 's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero \( well played by christian slater \) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth , he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he does n't use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim , he treats the caller as someone who is n't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure , but is n't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise \? the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry , folks , been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives , as none of these teens do , merely escalates the generational gap , and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
roger ebert , a review i greatly respect and normally agree with , raved about this flick roger , i love you , but you missed the boat on this one
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant it was n't a bad movie it simply was n't a good one boooooooring zzzz zzzz zzz
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives , it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
i never saw this movie until i was 16 the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments , well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now
did nicholson read the script before signing for this movie \? was he broke that he had to act \? has he reached senility to accept to play in such a poor scenario \?
i turned it off after 20 minutes
if they 're releasing 2 volumes per season , does n't that mean that there will be 18 sets since the show was on 9 years \? at 35 a volume that 's over 600 00 !
i do n't know how this skunk got 4 and 1 2 stars on amazon let alone one ! i could hear hepburn , bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford 's linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that , while the original sabrina was about her transformation , this version was about linus' transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end there was a merger , and you were in the way no hard feelings is very cold compared with bogart 's would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it \? in the original , you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you do n't get that here at all
for what purpose these lies about the life of this man \? are the liberal film makers racists who do n't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie \? if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man
not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes , it 's tantamount to watching old batman episodes as soon as something develops , in comes the cheesy music
the movie is one of my favorites , works on both a romantic level , and a comic level but where 's the widescreen \? todays consumers are more educated \( thank god \) and they 've almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen , you lose the top and bottom of the movie \? ! they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd \? it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who 's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it \? buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible
this movie was obviously made by japanese fans of several american films it then tried to mix them all together in one film
hart's war had potential the last months of world war two as a backdrop with demoralized gi 's crammed into an overcrowded pow compound if this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the battle of the bulge , then it could have had a chance instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny , not scary , and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns , do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we 've seen in films like baby boy almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word he did n't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance i do n't know what this film was about there are parts where there is a long silence with no talking the whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house
how anyone could rate this movie 4 5 stars is beyond belief this was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere as i watched this movie i could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama it was never very funny and both lead actors , playing one white and one adopted black brother , had scenes in the movie that were terrible romany malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body he jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings , runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them , in his drawers \? he is talentless and idiotic as a brother in france that no one can relate to paul rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and grossly tells off everyone people he has known for less than a week ! the servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well but ca n't make up for the dismal rest ludicrous a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama this is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints
the movie dead life by director william victor shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as night of the living dead or at least it tries to be unfortunately it 's a stupid attempt and being original through looking old , which in itself is an irony
okay i admit , they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends heres my problem , they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera , most of the scenes were blurry , every now and again the focus was clear , i mean c'mon , when i was fourteen i made a short stop motion animation film using an old bell and howell super 8 cam and even then i paid attention to the focusing okay enough of that , now for the pros of the film the make up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most men wince , the outdoor and some indoor settings had a notld feel overall i recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds , at least you can say you saw it rent if you can , if not , buy used
for years , i 've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low budget horror movies , but i 'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is dead life do n't be fooled when i say this movie is shot on film it seriously looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera it 's perpetually grainy , dark , fuzzy , and shaky , and not in an artsy way my 200 video camera looks infinitely better than this the video quality is appropriate , however , as it 's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink fest the sound is murky and undecipherable , the acting is strictly amateur hour , the characters are paper thin with no distinction or purpose , the story is non existent , the dialogue is a completely worthless bore , there 's nothing remotely scary , and the special effects \( including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a commodore 64 \) are laughable or , at least , i wish they were laughable that would 've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this \( high school \) student film it 's movies like this cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy , but which get cherry spots on blockbuster shelves because they 're packaged with slick cover art that give horror movies in general \( and zombie movies in particular \) a bad name , and that make horror fans so wary disgraceful !
unfocused , repetitive , and worst of all boring ! what should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame ronnie earle , the district attorney at the center of the film , says , this is n't about democrats and republicans , this is about cops and robbers if only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say instead , from the start , the big buy feels like a film you 've walked into thirty minutes late following the theme stated by earle of cops and robbers , the big buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic , but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely wo n't notice somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story , to bad it 's not being told here
with the exception of disc 6 this collection was very disappointing it was obvious that the show lost its charm after season 3 and was well on its way out before paul reubens little incident however , if you liked pee wee herman the first collection under playhouse 1 is excellent it was fresh and innovative my 3 year old loves the first 6 discs disc 7 to disc 10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase they should have included disc 6 with the first set anything after that was simply not entertaining the quality of all the discs still is excellent
leeches is a terrible movie dude , i have never seen anything so gay in my whole life \( except the director 's other film speed demon \) when the guys were less clothes than the gals , thats not a good sign the video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director 's work
the o c has got to be one of the most overrated , overhyped , shows that i have ever seen , this side of friends this show makes me ashamed to be from socal their is nothing appealing or compelling about a bunch of rich , spoiled , suburban , white teens \( sorry , i mean 24 , 25 , 28 year old acters playing teenagers \) and their so called problems i admit , i tried to give this show a chance , i tried to watch a few episodes , and really , i could n't make it passed the half an hour mark w out turning it to adult swim or some nick at night re run or something and speaking of white , is o c suppose to stand for orange county or only caucasians i had no idea , that their were no black , mexican , or asian people that lived in the o c peter gallagher 's character is suppose to be the bad guy huh \? please ! how about i snatch this chump off the o c streets , toss him in a trunk and take him to long beach , compton , crenshaw , or watts and then lets see how bad a guy he is then the bottom line is , i ca n't stand this gay , fake show and i ca n't stand all you losers that praise it even more ! and by the way , this show do n't even belong in the same zip code as b h 90210 ! now put that in yo pipes and smoke it !
i expected alot more from richard harris he was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of abraham also , there was n't enough vocal input from god , expecially since his promises to abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant there were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible i was somewhat annoyed that the movie had god saying that sarai 's name means princess and that he would change it to sarah which means queen this is not true ! ! in hebrew sarah means princess such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability
in dr yang 's dvd i expected to find a good reference for my practice of the yang 108 form , but i am very displeased with the quality of the dvd for the price that i paid , i expected a least good video quality when dr yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor there are close ups of the upper body and obviously , the movement of the legs is not seen you get lost with changes of camera angles at some point , you can see people in the background and the stage is not properly set up also , and with all due respect , his movements are weird i have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed definitively i do not recommend this dvd to any one who wants to use it as a reference , you can use it as a movie
i have been a long time radiohead fan and , like many others , have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old !
the original candyman sucks so bad , but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself , am i missing something \? so , i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it , so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series well , after watching candyman 2 , one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish again , the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme the villain in candyman makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary if you want a good laugh , watch the candyman series , but if you want to be scared , you would even do better to watch ren and stimpy in all seriousness , watch halloween and halloween ii if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and does n't try to send a social message lol some people call candyman 2 farewell to the flesh a horror movie i just call it rubbish
love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
my son loves airplanes and jets ! i bought this dvd based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video if you want a dvd that shows airplanes jets flying , do not buy this dvd ! the name of the video should be , watch the blue angles get ready to fly , because that is what this video is in the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying then the next 25 minutes is no flying just talking and showing the blue angles getting ready for their show in the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show my son has never made it to that point he wants to see airplanes jets fly and i'm now on a new search for a dvd that will do this for him

1 make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something
well i went to the concert and the whole time while i was watching it , i was glade they where coming out with a dvd because dvd can hold lots and lots and lots of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why i would be 100 i do n't care i want to see it all and well i waited months and months , wondering waiting for it to come out , i went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time then it was time the p t dvd of the century thank you emi for destroying a historial document so you can get all your signed contracts on to your dvd well now all i have to do is use my time machine and get a tape ready and tape the damn concert wait time machines doe n't exist well now i am going ot have to go underground to get it but wait i still 100 will emi release all the videos on dvd or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it all i can say this is why the internet was invented for information exchange if they keep information paticularly this historical document from people , they will share it over the internet the video does n't belong to 1 company it belongs to the world , the world created this and who does emi think they are by limiting this i am so sick and tired of this utter b t no one should settle for this , i demand more and everyone should demand more also 3 billion people watched 1 million spectaters and what does emi tell you , they will put the crappiest dvd together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website i believe i shall find them all and put them up on wikipedia because it is n't 1 person who owns the worlds creation anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them every extra cent of this dvd should go to africa and it doesnt it and its a bloody shame all i can say is i am making sure this goes on to every review for this damned dvd untill something is done about it
well , i guess i should 've read more reviews of this dvd it is strictly for beginners i do n't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up \( if i do breath of fire it helps \) when i want an easy day i 'll pop this in and do both sessions very simple but i'm sure it 's good for a beginner a beginning beginner sara ivanhoe is soothing though , and encouraging but seriously , this is a very easy workout
there 's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book , but it 's mostly emotional it 's an extremely multi layered novel and the work of a true master the film on the other hand is just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful to look at , with lots of skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice ripping nonsense , etc and next to no substance it has no artistic integrity whatsoever , as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did
the novel of wide sargasso sea was decent book a re writing of jane eyre 's bertha but the film is really hard to tolerate it starts out ok although it seems to start deviating from the book early on past the point where antoinette marries rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too
the lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real edward r murrow , and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the `50s , but otherwise i 'd did n't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short , boring movie that seemed much longer maybe i 've just seen too many biopics lately
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade , with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind , but it was a mess
i was hoping that socermania would be on the extreme sports fun dvd but no ! instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures this also goes for the other two dvd 's extreme music and adventure fun , allthough 'pluto 's blue note' , 'donald 's dilemma' 'no sail' 'old sequoia' and 'trailer horn' are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities and the chronological donald volume 2 \( which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration \) who needs these dvds , so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd 's and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration
film 4 5 stars dvd 0 stars
tyrese gibson , for worst actor ever up to this point , i 've been a huge paul walker fan for his comedically bad acting he 's made a career of it in this one , his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word bro at least 75 times \( to give his character street cred \) , and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops it 's clear walker is deeply considering his plight but really walker ca n't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of tyrese gibson my god where did they find this guy \? the movie would 've been ok as a standard , mindless action film , but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
do n't let the cover fool you , this film is n't half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it 's my own fault , but i was expecting something more like groove , or at least something interesting to watch and it 's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands , i often listen to joy division new order happy mondays , and more from that scene however , this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory , than it did about the music , and almost came off as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom , but saw it through anyway now i would n't call this bad , it had it 's good parts , just not many
24 hour party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung \( if best in show was not enough \) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the 2nd brit wave , and michael winterbottom could have exposed the goings on in a much better way
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story
all these shows are the syndicated ones there are at least 3 min cut from each show sony sucks big time for releasing edited shows not the first time \( see soap , other seasons of good times \) brought mine back and got a refund
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by 9th gate this film is tepid , there is none of the satanic intensity ambiance that you find in 'rosemary 's baby' it 's too hollywood , surprisingly , considering the maverick presence of depp polanski film opens well , with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence , but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 , which i was equally disappointed in , at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it , but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball , considering he was the producer director co screenwriter , and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible , so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film , rent it only buy angel heart instead
to borrow from a previous reviewer a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering
i am a fan of historical fiction , and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public , who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have , will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history , when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
i 've been a fan of the who since i recieved my copy of tommy on vinyl in 1970 for christmas
what were they thinking \? ! there are actually scenes deleted from the original theatrical release ! ! the extended edition is an abomination if there ever were one
this may be entitled warner bros classic holiday collection , but warner bros had nothing to do with the production or distribution of boys town , men of boys town , or the 1938 christmas carol louis b mayer may return to haunt the christmases of those heretics against the one , true religion of mgm , who purloined spencer tracey , mickey rooney , and ann rutherford to enrich the reputations of harry , jack , abe , and ted
absolutely terrible the most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of dane cook
i think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy i do n't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim , especially about how it 's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character \? but being in a liberal arts college i have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following the characters and the situations remind me of the short stories i would write in the sixth grade when i was around 12 years old , where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb , absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you 're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating , inane nonsense the whole movie feels like ones 12 year old self trying to write about adult problems that they 're distanced from yet infatuated by this movie appeals to the type of people who like to read catcher and the rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain smoking , wannabe depressed but more like i'm so sad 'cause i do n't have a girlfriend indie rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring i think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing , it 's unfortunate he ca n't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic subtle messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say hipster drivel look for something else to watch
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard \( of sports night fame \) was scowling hard , trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said , why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee \?
seriously , i am an expert , and this movie sucks but , imagine for a moment yes , stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound , strikingly engaging , and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals , those `experts' , whose tastes , likes and dislikes , decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all \? besides this interesting question , which is put forth explicitly , without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry , and in about 60 seconds , the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs
the only extraordinary thing about this film is how ow could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it i found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through \( after i dozed off \) do n't be fooled by the other review here they are the true fakes \( if you know what i mean \) save your money and save your time
following live 8 i have to wonder if live aid justifies the euphoria that followed it most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its aims well that 's debatable what it did manage to do was make bob geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name , knighted by the monarchy and very , very rich the same with u2 pushed them into the statosphere and made bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet same with queen pushed them into mega stardom so do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity , push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time sounds pretty good to me one ca n't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money' there was a shot \( deleted of course \) where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving another example of there hyprocrisy madonna singing 'imagine' on her latest tour ' imagine no prosessions yeah right ! i ca n't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that mccartneys version of 'let it be' was stomach churning \? face it the only musician \( peter green ex fleetwood mac \) who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified proves a point
capote , directed by bennett miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace , was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005 it is based on gerald clarke 's 1988 non fiction book capote a biography the film starts by capote 's \( philip seymour hoffman \) interest in the kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime his knowledge of the criminals , especially perry smith \( clifton collins jr \) , which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship the writer is sympathetic and sees in smith a strong resemblance with himself , yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it in cold blood was his most famous novel the one that established him as a legendary writer he was left overwhelmed , confused and unsatisfied , however the movie is quite ambiguous , though characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive at many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations for instance , people are always laughing heartily at what capote has to say , although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter the setting and the music were both barely significant although philip seymour hoffman 's performance is highly remarkable , the actor 's resemblance of capote is questionable hoffman is 5'10 and more stout than the slender , barely 5'2 truman capote
this movie is utterly unremarkable actually , scratch that this movie is actually very remarkable because of how bad it is first of all , the protagonist is pathetic it 's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful , weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems all she does is cry and moan second , the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i 've seen in any movie third , there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered , which disrupt the movie 's flow and continuity for example , the protagonist gets hit head on by an 18 wheeler truck , and her car is absolutely mangled , but she walks away without a scratch someone care to explain how that 's possible \?
i 've been had is all i can say , after reading other reviews i really thought this would be an interesting , exciting movie instead , the story is lame , the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so not scary or at least gripping i watched the whole thing as i thought maybe i am missing something , but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end sorry guys , but this is nowhere near , audition , tale of two sisters or even whispering corridors
if you 've seen tortilla soup , there is no need to watch this movie this is just the chinese version of the said movie the similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both same characters , same plot only in a different setting
this movie is no heathers it 's not even mean girls as hard as it tried to be witty , shocking , dark , and satirical , it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i'm just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless and the craft until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push , i just did n't get it the movie was n't funny \( which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses , carol kane , could n't even elicit a smile out of me \) , the plot was full of holes , and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers , but i was at least hoping for 1 1 2 hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately , the entertainment piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless
my wife and i ejected this dvd after half way through and planned to throw it out i later figured i 'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it the last guy is good and i wo n't throw this away now he does a bit on throwing up that is good most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no , not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids , that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack , a travesty to the nth degree
there are 2 types of people who like black and white films old people and clever clogs know it alls why watch this when you can buy picture perfect with the lovely jennifer aniston for the same price the emperor 's new clothes
rent it but by all means do n't buy it you wo n't watch it more than once this movie is not for those who have invested 25 hours into the tv show although you will better understand what 's going on if you have seen the show , none of this will really seem new or interesting to you you learn some new facts about bob and the man from another place , but nothing important for the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show , adding only pointless and unrealistic new occurances \( bobby kills someone , donna is replaced by an new actor , coop forsees all the future comings of laura 's murder , etc \) all of the twin peaks charm that you have come to love is gone and the movie really suffers from that you ca n't only give coop 10 meaningless lines and expect the show to succeed i think lynch 's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series , focusing on the complications of coop being in the black lodge , harry having an emotional attachment to coop but being forced to bring him down , etc
this is the classic ww2 submarine war movie , and most ww2 submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie i greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action , based on what i read about ww2 submarines the special effects are a bit cheesy , you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships but if you overlook those items , you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of
i hated this movie it is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does stupid plot too many holes and stupid ending
i suppose if you never read the book , you might think this movie is good maybe even charming but having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel , i was so grossly disappointed i ca n't tell you
this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen \? the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town \?
dont get me wrong , i'm kinda young but i love 80 's 90 's movies specially the horror ones i had great spectation for early geoge romero movies but both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad gorge romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry , but for today standars they are not , even they are not that good for most of the 80 's 90 's movies
this is by far the worst moive i 've seen i love the first secret garden no one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl it 's a classic but this sequel is terriable it controdicts the first moive it takes the magic away if you liked the origanl , first moive do n't watch this , it will take the magic out of the first moive
the slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy unintelligible at time not what the books are about
if your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of end of the century or filth and the fury this ain't it ! picture taking 40 hours of bad home video \( really awful sound \) and editing together and calling it a documentary no current interviews , no voice over making any sense of the chaos no thought to flow or storyline , just a mishmash of stuff banged together a real dissapointment the saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it , this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance i 've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due its a shame this is what its been reduced to shame on everyone involved
i picked this set up despite reservations \( reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show \) because of the creator j michael straczynski unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible , horrible film mindless , drawn out banter , and weak story line our copy eventually broke \( stepped on \? \) we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star seems like a generous rating
well , i wrote the review about this set , and boy was i disappointed when i got it i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse come on guys , at least try to put some effort into it ! ! ! i got the set , watched it lt and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use what a waste of money ! !
gina is just like the protesters she just does n't get it ! the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it ! whereas africa 's problems including poverty aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down ! as long as more babies are born than people dying , their population goes up very bad the only way to eliminate poverty is less children ! ! send money for that but nothing else
the concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded the girl in the cafe turned out to be a left wing political message i wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character gina \? gina browbeats the members of the g8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world , particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows does the thought ever cross her mind \( or the person writing the script \? \) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of hiv aids , all varieties of venereal disease , children born out of wedlock , etc \? maybe gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly
this should be called the john ford tiny collection , as most of his major films are not included even john ford the early years would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of ford 's work
for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this 0 stars the infamous fake o scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable
trinity collection is a bootleg picture is extremly poor 3 movies for 10 too bad , i like trinity , she 's cute ooops , wrong trinity
this film is definitely not a masterpiece i found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly over rated yes , the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak to make matters worse , the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere perhaps i missed something gigantic because i was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but i would not attempt to see it again however , there were a couple of memorable scenes
i would love to review this lions gate dvd , but i ca n't catch one word in ten it is not , as advertised , closed captioned , and the characters' speech is too casual and british for me to get drat ! i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version
i was not happy with this purchase this video only taught 10 min of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end the teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds , i could have used more teaching and less of a porn show this was a waste of money ! there are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise
i do n't know how i managed to see this gory splatterfest twice in college it 's a terrible movie \( next to that other awful movie wild wild west which also stars salma hayek \)
how could mr cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody \?
when i saw the movie , it was so predictable halfway into it , the broadcasts were so lame as well as the so called live footage total rip off of war of the worlds reminded me
i am pretty easy to please when it comes to movies low budget , high budget , doesn't matter this movie is actually the worst movie i have ever seen in my 45 years of viewing was totally not believable and the writing and directing was shabby at best don't waste your hard earned bucks on this lemon ! ! ! !
into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites having seen the pbs presentation of this , i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction , this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close ups this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play the staging by forcing the viewer 's perspective , this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath
i purchased this movie because i love chris cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive i played the movie yesterday and boy , was i disappointed
this is a horror movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage i do n't mean the acting is garbage , though it is i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage , such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a one man murder wave , then bingo i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat blow away the cast
i generally admire jennifer aniston 's work so i picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn sadly , watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie if you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes , you would't miss much since nothing really happens if it 's a comedy , it is n't funny if it 's a slice of life , the lives are deadly dull the emotional level is so low key you suspect the entire group is on valium jenifer aniston especially , seems to have phoned this one in
dull and pointless how could jennifer aniston read this script and think that doing this film was a good idea \? we had to turn it off about half way through shallow , boring , superficial take your pick it 's like a contest which character 's life sucks the most if you 're going to depress people , at least make it interesting would it have been so hard for the writers to mix in a plot with their nihilism
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50 's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man , with firth as the anchor of the team off stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives but i found truth confusing and unengaging i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo and as several have noted , lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible give this one a pass
the human race today is in a really bad state , mainly because most people do not want to wake up they want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power miceal ledwith in the great questions in the hamburger universe , vol 1 of deep deceptions
chamber was always the worst entry in the harry potter series , but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse choppy editing , horrible humor personified by the untalented rupert grint , smug acting by the equally untalented emma watson , poor screenwriting by that hack steve kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack chris columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience
perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln 's various works , such as the sacred place , the messianic legacy , and holy blood , holy grail , or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books
i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i did n't want to leave the house i was a little disappointed in this dvd i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising the routines are broken down into four separate workouts the only one that involved any effort on my part was the pilates inspired section as for the rest , the other sections would have you do too few reps , i felt , to get your muscles warmed up , let alone reshape them i think this dvd is great for beginners its simple enough to follow and it wo n't scare you away too soon but if you 're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine , this probably is n't the abs workout for you
i looked at the name \( groovaloos \) and i looked at the cover and my gut told me not to get this dvd i went against my gut and believed the reviews i wish i 'd listened to my gut for those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey , you 're right on the money they can all dance , but compared to what i expected , they seemed mediocre here 's the lowdown \( 1 \) the sound sucks they 're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine , but the music is n't loud enough to really feel something that makes you want to move , \( 2 \) they just seem like a group of people who do n't naturally have a rhythm , but they 've learned some moves it 's so not inspiring , \( 3 \) it 's not edgy enough , and \( 4 \) it looks good if you 've got a group doing it , but when someone 's doing it alone , it 's just okay overall , this dvd was okay , but not great get it only if you 're truly desperate
i was a huge fan of the books growing up , and a lover of the period and jannette oke 's books i had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series well , i just finished and could hardly stop from yawning while i watched !
viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time many of those films that stand the test of time are from the fantasy genre , including labyrinth and dark crystal would i add neverending story to that list \? hell no the dubbing is atrocious \( funny germans \) , and the costumes and effects are flat out bad labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days , and easily trumped neverending story when it was released two years later the story and plot had the potential to be interesting , but the execution makes neverending fall flat and sure , neverending story may have advocated reading in the mid 80 's , but labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics , which is the next step up for mind expansion
unwatchable ! ! ! ! ! over rated poet singers who sing off key aggrandizing this mediocrity is ludicrous
i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5 in my mind this is a whole new venture , one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley 's a great hero
francisco was right , this film is about as well conceived as buttcrust
there was one scary moment in this movie the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she dies now that was creepy i then awaited more moments like that nothing nada lame tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb and that young boy what is up with that \? \? he 's trying to be like the kid in the sixth sense \( who was brilliant and totally believable \) this movie did not scare me and the idea of people being afraid to use vhs tapes after this \? come on
i have not seen this movie , nor do i ever want to i 've only seen the previews on tv and read about it in previews why do i think it 's probably one of the stupidest , pointless movies on the face of the earth \? , because i bet just about every guy who 's had trouble getting girls watched it , took notes , and believed each and every single thing that was in this movie , and believed every sentence that was in this movie where you got to hear the woman thinking out loud in the movie i bet many guys took this movie way too seriously
having enjoyed lost in translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i ca n't fathom the entire plot is self serving , shallow , and unrealistic i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values , and while i do n't condone those , the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it , and it does n't mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! \?
i bought this dvd for my collection i do not buy full screen format dvds amazon described the dvd as anamorphic , closed captioned , color , dolby , full screen , widescreen , ntsc with an aspect ration of 2 35 1 however , when it arrived , it was full screen only with an aspect ratio of 1 33 1 consequently , i returned it my recommendation , if you only want widescreen , do n't believe the description that this dvd is dual layered and do n't buy it
julia roberts plays ed harris' young new wife susan sarandon plays harris' ex wife ex wife does not like new wife new wife does not like ex wife ex wife 's cutsey , but bratty kids make new wife 's life a living hell ex wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo new wife thinks ex wife is a nagging battle axe new wife and ex wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum how does the film solve this conflict \? ex wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer everyone reconciles , ex wife and new wife suddenly love each other , the end this is one of the most cliched , saccharine , hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by hollywood in the past decade if you like julia roberts , susan sarandon or ed harris , please see erin brokovich , dead man walking and the right stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe
it is a shame that american film classics \( like l and h \) get more attention and love outside of the us than in it
personally , i found 8 1 2 to be one of the most boring films i 've ever seen it was a pretentious , self indulgent trip down the director 's memory lane i understood the plot , and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end , but overall was bored silly by stilted , pointless dialogue
okay , this is a really bad movie that said , there are some moments here that are so over the top bad that they 're funny the fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving sandra bullock is outright hilarious and very embarassing how she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery , but the acting in that scene is ridiculous , as well however , it is certainly memorable sandra bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film , but her role is essentially a throw away part then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor steve buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in his character never returns to the story after that by the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues the acting is bad , the budget is obviously low , and the script , which invokes the occasional giggle , is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel avoid this film
what do we do
not a bad movie not a great movie ellen brustyn was great
i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective film fans and alec baldwin groupies \( a k a my mom , my stepfather , and me \) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment baldwin , who also served as co producer , brought james lee burke 's new orleans ex cop recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy tough guy gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things
i'm not going to write too much if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here
after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast , carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well \? my reasons for asking , the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen , yet in the original film selena , alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school , also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there 's selen'as boyfriend \( whose name escapes me at the moment \) in the original film he stood by her , through the murder charges , the revelation of the rape , and the miscarriage , yet in the sequel i'm suppose to buy that he could n't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena , yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast \? i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film was n't taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all
this program is evil it is easy to get sucked into watching gantz , because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters , who have all died , find themselves in they have gone to purgatory , and purgatory is like an all too real video game one feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries
i would n't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that i had to when i saw what christiane schmidt had to say
let me just start by saying that i do n't own the chosen collection but that i do own the original releases of all seven seasons
this movie is the most boring , uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever
director turi meyer
the saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series i can remember the first time i watched the original created by clive barker , i luv 'd it , the same ca n't be said for this film caroline is last living descendent of the candyman , and he wants to end it all by ending her all who watch this film and the acting of donna d' errico will wish for the same thing one would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of baywatch for the film and for that reason only , or maybe it 's because a little fragile thing like her ca n't take on candyman head on get a real actress like kathy bates in there and she 'll kick his ass misery is a classic
maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking , but i doubt it since vanilla ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie , the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new i went to high school with kids like this and i 've bought the eminem cd and there 's a little more to them than the stupidity but let 's discuss the movie
this is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub plots because there are none there is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie , so it makes for excellent escapism , which we all need now and then since all the characters stay together , it is easy to follow along , so you can turn your brain off , it wo n't be needed since it 's all about the ship , acting was n't necessary you can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of russell and dreyfus i felt pity for them as actors , and hope they can rebound the movie is shorter than most , so there will be minimum impact on your life you will remember nothing about it soon after exposure
i am 38 and considered obese , however i work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy this dvd would be great for the older generations i still need to loose 45 pounds and i am using denise austin 's burn fat fast
i think denise austin does a decent job in some of her other videos , but this is n't one of them she lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she 's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot the moves are not well choreographed and very awkward some may find encouragement in the times denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says we 're burning butter yeah but i found it annoying i think there are much better workouts for the money out there
definatly one of the worst movies ever the dialog is so boring i had an a d d attack trying to watch it i usally never turn a movie off in the middle but i had to do it with this one i tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it , so i would never have to suffer through this again the characters are so lame i did'nt even care about who was threating his life i wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it it fu in sucks ! ! ! ! ! and it is really dated
love the movie , but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off , wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain , so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title , so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here , years later , when i'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
this movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre , far less interesting than pulp fiction and even below the level of reservoir dogs it is said that in the violent late middle ages street shows were often staged in european cities where fake blood flowed like water , heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines during an evisceration delighting the crowd it seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come full circle from barbara tuchman 's gripping account of the awful fourteenth century despite the abundant gore if the film had been better handled it could have been quite good there are glimpses of its failed potential at different points for instance the scene towards the end where the prison governor 's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct copy of an actual event at the bastille during the days of the early french revolution in sum , as a special kind of disgusting art form it is interesting , as entertainment though natural born killers sucks i admit some people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend public executions if they were available for viewing
i felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer after about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so i turned it off
i was on a plane from shanghai to bangkok stop drooling and i was reading a book on the tv , i saw tim allen chasing an orange cat in the course of the chase , he dropped down from two legs to four the effects , i 'll admit right up front , were great this looked far better than the old 70s \( i think \) version called the shaggy d a , which i have n't seen but even so , it sucks i did n't need sound or subtitles , and i did n't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks true sucking is like that \( yeah , i saw the bit with the scrabble board i am dad whoop dee freaking doggy doo \) it 's possible we underestimate tim allen 's ability as an actor , perhaps because the santa clause was so unforgivably bad but even so , this movie sucks sometimes life is just that simple
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival , and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is the whole cast is wasted in this movie , and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better like pretty much the leads in this movies , i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in , but this one , they might as well if your a tim allen fan , please do yourself a favor , and get either the santa clause movies , or the toy story movies , and avoid this movie at all costs here are 99 minuts of my life , that i wo n't see again , and i am trying to make sure that you do n't waste your time on this dud who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog , in some scenes in the movie , ore pretty much the whole thing i have n't seen monster house or cars , but i hope that these will be 2 better movies , or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this dave douglas \( tim allen \) is a lawyer , that dislikes dogs , and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester \( joshua leonard \) and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant strictland and he does n't much of a family life , since he is never home , and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie \? his wife is rebecca douglas \( kristin davis \) and they have 2 children josh \( spencer breslin \) and carly \( zena grey \) and he has an appoontment to josh 's pta meetings , and even through he is reminded at work , he forgets carly is not only a is both forrester 's student and a budding animal advocate herself , and her brother is trying out for football like his dad , even through he secretly hates it , and did n't sign up for the fall musical and then there is a mad scientist \( robert downey jr \) , trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300 year old dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery and carly even kidnaps it from grant strictland , and brings him home , nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas , that gets him starting acting like a dog too , and even looking exactly like him at times the movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old , which would be impossible , since neither dogs or people live that long , all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes , and this is one to avoid at all costs
it 's a disgrace they charge money for this dvd producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold
this was purhcased by accident but still one of the crapiest movies i ever seen story wise , well it 's bad to see what situation young girls could have with whores for mothers and growing up just like them it 's actualy very sad to see young girls throwing away their life away other wise , movie had bad ending , good quality packing and dvd from amazon com
mccully 1
this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package ! ! ! ! ! ! amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens !
i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics , or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i cannot compare the character to other sources therefore , coming from someone that did not know darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment !
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even boring to my friends so it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me it is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me it was n't the violence \( in short bursts \) it was n't the acting \( the acting was pretty good actually \) but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure i did n't care who was sending the tapes and i did n't care what would happen with the main characters they were unrelatable on just about any level this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 4 's of the way in and you 'll think , wow i wonder where the story will go next and then it does n't that was it very disappointing i do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's some kinda payoff in the end i really do n't understand all the acclaim that this movie got as a suspense movie or as an art film it fails pretty miserably the premise was a good idea that went nowhere slowly viewer beware
this movie sucks ! it is fake , everything is staged chicks dont laugh when they fight , nor do they dress like strippers !
this dvd sucks , all the fights are fake , retarted , drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time i 've ever had in my life i am now stupider for watching this dvd and buying it is on my list of regrets i have in life i wish i could say the only good part was but there was no good part no shirts ripped off or good hits thrown , nothing i am a marine stationed in japan looking for a dvd to enjoy and this is what i get where is the love
killing me softly has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break not only does it set up an improbable situation , but the big twist at the end is also mind numbingly predictable \( unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life \) the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned , he 's an inexpressive bloke , while heather graham is all too expressive she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera besides , she 's not even that attractive even her co star in this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out of the water in that department the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth , sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did , i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly
whatever possessed jessica lange to appear in this mess will never be known the payoff at the end is a huge disappointment jessica lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in gwyneth paltrow is unbelievably bad but i think this is not their fault the screenplay and direction could have been better this could have been a very good movie along the lines of misery or fatal attraction but it fails in every department as i said , the payoff at the end is a real disappointment this film is a waste of time and money stay away from it !
kelly preston and tcheky karyo are a new york city couple who come together after preston leaves matthew broderick and karyo uses meg ryan in order to get a visa now broderick and ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex 's the problem is , the offenses they 've endured \( being dumped and being used \) do n't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people , especially karyo which is probably why first time director griffin dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles after all , how can we not root for ferris bueller and harry 's sally \? unfortunately , it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive , the pace of the film is so uneven , and the script is n't particularly funny
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism
i have been a beatles fan since 1964 , and i have distinct memories of the band 's influence on my young life i saw hard day 's night , help ! , yellow submarine , and let it be in the theater when they were first released this film has always been the holy grail of beatle fandom
upon its initial release , the attention that otto preminger 's anatomy of a murder attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems when watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock , its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center
there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound , then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash , but at least that was \( somewhat \) assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours , and as much as i \( usually \) enjoy george clooney , i might never forgive him for this drek
viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching , waiting , hoping ! ! ! , the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough , must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture my advise is for you to save your money and buy comos \( the best imo \) to be honest , i could n't wait to sell it used at a 10 lose through amzn the following week \( they get a commission for sold items \) nonetheless , i am content i no longer own it next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn just so you know , cosmos i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn the late carl sagans cosmos blows away the astronomer
i am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good ratings ive been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like because this movie stinks !
george sluizer 's original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version , you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head , but the film had plenty more to offer than that , playing with chronology , subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes' plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself , but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered
while some critics can argue with dan brown 's research and reasoning on certain historical points , one thing these da vinci debunking presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity , primarily by the catholic church , and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago 1969 nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light , when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago , with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still , quite frankly , shocking and debasing sorry , but upon this rock of male dominancy was built the church
i enjoyed the movie even though i was only able to watch it in segments the first time i tried to watch it , after about 20 minutes , the screen went to digital gibberish and my dvd player hung up so that i could n't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power i had to unplug the dvd player , wait , and replug the power cord to remove the disc overnight , i decided i needed to replace my dvd player however , the next morning , i tried a different dvd and it worked fine it still works fine on all my other dvds i complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of showgirls unfortunately , this one has the same problem it plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my dvd player i gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without showgirls i use my dvd player almost every day and it works fine except when i try to watch showgirls
i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common i ca n't say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire taught me about roman a clefs , of which devil is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor in chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second \( or third \) made over princess role the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend lily , are mostly wasted
i was under the impression that this was the entire series i finally , after many issues , got my set and unwrapped it , and my heart sank audibly when i saw complete collection i i popped the last disk in and lo and behold , it was n't the full series afterall
the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is reservior dogs this has great actors in it i enjoyed seeing , f'instance , dame dunaway but , she , sinise , dillon , mantegna , and perpetual co lister faison had a poor dialog to work with imagine if qt had written it or , my favorite tough guy screenwriter , david mamet fortunately though , spacey will have something to build on develop a director 's repertoire
during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically , the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was spot on , and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd 's characters and keeping in form , he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film , but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries , and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however , his contribution seems way overstated to me he does n't have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think , jar jar blinks i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that 's it flat and mechanical
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie , i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander , got my tickets in advance , and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater
enjoyed leary 's rescue me and the job so much but was really disappointed in his stand up not funny and over done
this must have seemed like a great idea at the time , cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor the problem is his range is all the way from a to b
even though i would agree that erin brockovich is an entertaining movie , julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath story , but this movie has such shaky roots in reality , it is more of a tall tale , than the true story of a historic class action suit that , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it did satisfied ones however , as the movie title implies , this is indeed erin brockovich 's story , in the same way that the xena character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess \( though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character \)
there are no words to describe how awful \( ! ! ! \) this movie was from beginning to end , but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day evening from being ruined the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is touched by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle need i say more \?
this movie is not vulgar nor does it rate nc17 dont believe the hype check out pink flamingos instead , now that is a vulgarly righteous movie by waters and the with the goddess of filth devine
i watched this movie all the way through only because i paid 22 00 plus shipping and felt i should give it every chance to redeem itself it is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings i would give it 10 ! ! rated r for what \? language \? adult content \? i have seen disney films more deserving of the r rating this movie was silly , definitely not entertaining in any way and i threw it in the same bucket i put my dog 's crap in when i clean up the yard i am a chris isaak fan , have all his cds and went to his concert on december 9 the fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately , even his music i did not find the film offensive , i enjoy hard core porn i feel this is a rip off , poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone ! ! !

the film has its amusing and even touching points , but not very many the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters henry is just the kind of self important , ego bloated , smug , arrogant , cold blooded corporate ass that 's helped step on working people for real , so it 's really hard to feel anything for him , shot or not he 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him , and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is , if you think about it , appalling and his wife is , in a way , even worse she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up , and does n't become normal ntil much later only their daughter has any heart at all maybe a better ending would 've been henry 's not making it , bening going nuts from losing her stuff , and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should 've been from day one barely watchable
love michael buble , but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience parts of michael 's head was cut off , and then sometimes , his whole head was cut off most of the time , the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert that this was just home made videos this was definitely not worth 20 if you want a professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act caught in the act was worth the 20 bucks you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements , and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd also , the sound quality on caught in the act was way better now , i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it the dvd that i received was not enhanced anyways , skip this one , and get caught in the act instead
this was so messy and mr dorrington so over the top in
i remember loving this movie and all of its silliness i recently made it a nostalgia purchase and realized it is n't that great but my 6 year old loved it and continues to watch it all the time my child is now a weird al fanatic and i am ok woth that
this dvd covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds ! it does not give enough body to the addition explanation and is hard to follow it was a pure waste of money
do not buy this dvd as it is a total waste of money , joe walsh can
this show is so boring all it 's about is poltics what was hbo thinking having the one of the oddest shows out , it does n't play no background music even when it 's going off and all the people do on that show is argue like petie little children , in one episode i found very shocking to hear was from a blond hair woman saying the two oldest sons of saddam hussian that died they made their bodies into make up she said it 's so \( queer eye for the straite guy \) and another episode she call a gay a fag , i did n't know she had that in her what i found weird was why would actor george clooney would talk what the show is all about during previews , he has nothing to do with political things thank god k street never did get a second season
jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end the only mystery is in the details no real suspense i found the plot to be a little farfetched
this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that i saw it in a free sneak preview
despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality , this film is a complete put on the long set piece scenes \( wedding , russian roulette , etc \) are much discussed , usually either in the context of being essential for character development or boring in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills once he does try to move things along , awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set piece to another , you can see the reason for his procrastination despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth , he really has nothing to say the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness , by giving false and short lived impressions of character and narrative , but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything happen narrative wise
so so story about a man 's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star 's mother
about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick , incestuous , and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood , do n't watch this
waste of time i turned it off the extra features were slightly interesting the actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing a vanity piece why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating , badly written melodrama do n't bother
this pride and prejudice fan was hoping for a modern day movie with a storyline much closer to pride and prejudice even colin firth could'nt save this one for me ! on its own i found it sadly lacking in just about everything i look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor if you are a true pride and prejudice fan , i recommend buying the bbc series and the 2005 movie version both are excellent i would'nt waste my time again with this one
if this movie were set in the us , i would 've given it 1 star but the british accent , humor , and colloquialisms partially saved it but not enough , sorry to say !
it seems like the actors did n't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts ! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot overly timid and shy captain wentworth is n't at all handsome or dashing and when they finally get together at the end , it 's so awkward , bland , and unclimactic you wished you 'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book some people might have liked it , but i definitely did n't to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like , i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice this movie could have been bette

all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane 's life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane 's life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is , at best , an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect
i was optimistic for greg kinnear once he was very funny ragging on soap soup he usually plays the nice guy second banana in film or a man dying of aids auto focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960 's tv icon , hogan , in hogan 's heroes the replication of the original cast is a bit eerie after all , these actors dress up as german prison guards a chill goes down my spine , but hogan 's was a comedy , which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny ss guys anyhow , bob crane played hogan for six years and kinnear badly imitated yes , i'm sorry to say , kinnear is awful as crane , which puts a damper on the bio flick
this has not aged well the scripts are silly , the acting is of the chewing up the scenery variety gale storm no longer seems cute she comes across as annoyingly perky spend your money on something else
i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife here are my gut impressions
the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo \( apparently supernatural \? \) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as do you believe in ghosts \? the lighter scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in 3d yet the polar express still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children
this film is a tough one to review the film itself is amazing so therefore , i should give it high marks the problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos , and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature \( as if we came from outer space or something \) that is a bad and dangerous message , and so i feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
there 's a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one her acting debut i 'll be there is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so
the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two , and the first dvd had good color saturation , dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now , though , and the image of course is higher resolution
this was probably the worst royal rumble in history it featured three very bad matches , one decent one , a lousy royal rumble and an absolutely amazing match
let 's face it some of the jokes are funny the one about mike tyson been like someone else 's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny i also found the bit about bill clinton and osama bin laden also funny however , jamie dwells too much on the fart joke how can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes \? after 2 min it becomes worn and so unfunny why does he repeat himself so much with that line , i am not saying she 's a crackhead , just a bit crackish \? it sounds very rehearsed after the second time if it were only for these errors i would have found the jokes altogether acceptable
i enjoy the initial season of murder she wrote very much my wife and i are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to who dun it frequently , though , it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up often the audio gets out of synch with the video terrible ! we surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons , but now about 3 4 the way through , i think we 'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided dvd 's
i , too , found this dvd a bit boring the instruction for each pose took forever , even in the challenging workouts while in depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices , i did n't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence also , i did not feel as if there was any flow to this dvd
terrible voice , depressing indoor scenery , incredibly disjointed routines do n't bother with this one ! save your money
but for me at least , i found it rather hard to root for mel gibson 's character , given the fact that he was a major , major drug dealer when the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with michelle pfeiffer and all the loot , i did n't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict gibson as a loving father , a phenomenally successful businessman , and a super stud , one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes drug dealing
michael moore can be really funny at times , but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' , i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films
paul newman plays a burned out private eye and gene hackman and susan sarandon are a movie star couple with a long buried dark secret too implausible , too many overdrawn secondary characters a rental at best
do n't bother wasting your time with this movie , instead read the book the book was one of the best i have ever read , the movie left me wanting i rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through so maybe i am being unfair since i did not watch the whole movie , but honestly i could n't , it just did n't do the story justice
this movie is the most boring , uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever
i myself am a huge buffy angel fan , i had read the reviews here and i thought it was worth a shot seeing it well the script was terrible , the story even worse , direction do n't get me started one reviewer said it , it was like they did n't know whose point of view to choose the soundtrack was awful the ending was sooo stupid did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them they just keep standing there like nothing is happening i really have n't seen a movie this bad in well ever ! ! oh and alyson hannigan 's acting was way better in my stepmother is an alien i think she was about 13 in that role do n't get me wrong she 's a extremely talented actress i blame it on the script
if you are willing to risk to watch this movie , just a warning it 's really a turkey , one of the big ones
i thought the movie was alright , but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus , i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
this movie was a bit lame for me robin williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie , and the supporting cast was n't much better , but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen even if this had been a good movie , the green screen was very distracting i would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff
i was so disappointed with this video i thought it would contain more than it did , but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all
if you have bothered to read all the other reviews here , i think you will get the point , but still unsure \?
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me poor acting and hard to understand dialoge would get a refund if you were in australia but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas and it could get lost in the mail
this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times the owens girls are hereditary witches , any man who loves one is doomed to an early death there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion , this requires the sacrifice of a dove two little girls watch years later they 're grown up one leaves to live with her boyfriend but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck \( never stand in the middle of a road \) we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell witch , as if to symbolize something
ok , the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long \? jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions , they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters
after i read erik larson 's wonderful book the devil in the white city i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes' story but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment the production is amateurish at best , complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of mondo carne with such a wealth of fascinating information available \( court transcripts , etc \) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened \? this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland truly disappointing perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes this most certainly is n't it
this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper it 's a good story , just poorly directed \( capra ca n't hit a home run every time \) i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
this is my number one most overrated movie of all time we saw it at a pretensious artsy theater , along with an assortment of ex hippies and wooly haired intellectuals they all cheered , of course , when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water , then becomes the chief the truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable , given the politically correct theme the truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture the truth is that tradition is not inherently evil the truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys basically , if you hate men , this is the flick for you but it is not good it is not creative there are no surprises there is just nothing there as i edit this , it 's no surprise to find so few people liked this review there are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so and so 's out there
hello \? \? \? \? \?
this disc is like a whitman 's candy sampler it has a lot of different things but a lot of the things you do n't really want the film covers kids , high schoolers , college ball and college recruiting pay controversies , aba , nba through all its decades , harlem globetrotters , the street game and inner city stars , country boys , indiana basketball , retired old timers hanging in florida , current stars , marketing \( are there any hoop videos that do n't talk about sneaker brands \) , public relations , fireworks , cheerleaders , guys on trampolines , women 's basketball whew none of these subjects is studied in depth if you 've followed basketball for a while , you know and have seen most of this the subject sampling seems to jump all over the place , so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want i 'd rather see a dvd star profile \( jordon , iverson \) or nba at 50 or spike lee 's movie , or hoop dreams , etc 1 love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a wilson basketball or it seems like something you 'd see on sunday tv , after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends in short , 1 love is a decent sampling , but nothing to sink your teeth into
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
comedy comes in many forms everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire and in just friends there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types first , the movie wants to be a gross out comedy the sight gags are plentiful , the physical comedy abundant and often cruel , and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic however , the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart these elements have been combined successfully in the past there 's something about mary jumps right to mind here , we get something far less successful
i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years stupid , stupid and stupid ryan reynolds becomes annoying
in spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women , the comedian bernie mac stole this picture ! he played his part of the low life , club owning , hustler with perfect timing and high humor he made this movie enjoyable to watch
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off , it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that , the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school , i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love
i think this film wants to make you vomit i do n't know about you , but that is not a quality i am looking for in my films being scared is fine being in suspense is great , vomiting is not i really think that is what this film was going for it has some pretty disgusting moments while i was watching it i kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes in fact , i am feeling it now as i write this review and think about the movie
i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am i thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself
the video in this dvd looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a dvd disc a standard 4 7gb disc , by the way that 's what you 'll get when you buy this
we were disappointed in this dvd and thought it was a waste of money we did not learn anything new they went through things quickly , everything was so basic , things that are mainly common sense i felt this was a big huge waste of money , and is now in the trash
this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant , in other words , what you learn here wo n't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics , such as how to breastfeed properly , how to bottlefeed properly , how to swaddle properly , how to calm a baby properly , etc all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn , each is given about 5 seconds of screen time instead , the bulk of the program is wasted on things like pre birth preparation , which interestingly appears toward the end of the program , and how the mother should take care of herself these are important things to know , but not for a ultimate baby care dvd
our daughter has weak muscles and i wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy i saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears not ! it did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us
when i was looking for a fitness dvd for me and my two oldest children \( girls , ages 3 1 2 and 2 \) to do together , i was impressed with the reviews of this dvd and it sounded intriguing though i was n't really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet , so we rented it from netflixs to try it out first
the hidden fortress is classic kurosawa , in every way except for the wild overacting , inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued , or given comic material with more edge , skewering the upper classes as well as themselves , or been less in the focus and operated far in the background , this would n't have been a problem but instead we 're offered a sort of dumb dumber , beavis butthead of japan , 50 years ago \( and yes , i know that is anachronistic , but it 's all too true \) stupidity is funny wears thin after a short while , and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast oh , here comes a rocky upwards incline let 's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up , etc
it is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by roger moore' performance her 's good for a dandy , in the continent , but in this film he is not convincing at all he is verry debonnaire , like he is just sipping tea in great britain thus , the film becomes stiff and you do n't believe it the other actors simply try to do something , like a farce it is a pity to see the great richard burton in such role
as usual , michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours theres alot of great stuff here \( the interview w marilyn manson , the interview w trey parker , c \) , but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling , no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston i agree with many , nay most of moores politics but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution
this stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners this was the first stability ball dvd that i purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level if you are a beginner , i would recommend leslie sansone 's you can do stability ball training if you are a beginner or more advanced , i would recommend denise austin 's shrink the female fat zone or the quickfix stability ball training my all time favorite dvd for the stability ball is denise austin this is by far my least favorite
this workout was very hard for me to get into i became very bored by it the moves were challenging but the routine was blah if you are a beginner , this is not for you you are better off purchasing quick fix stability ball workout no matter what your level of fitness
boring and like most every other new horror movie lame mask , i think the awful movie cut used this mask also , who cares i suppose this goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies \( scream , i know what you did , valentine , urban legend , cut etc \) so bottom line do n't waste your time , stick with 80 's slashers
i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in you got served and was extremely disappointed the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those , i do n't know the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch , but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
what movie was every one else watching \? certainly not this one very , very , slow disjointed story line i hate to be a bore but this was boring enjoy
the first butterfly effect is one of my all time favorite movies with that in mind , i eagerly started watching be2 within the first 5 minutes it became clear that i was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie but after finishing it , it was clear that i would have to flat out lie to do that
nick lachey and jessica simpson have a few good moments in the nick and jessica variety hour but the show looks too '70s in its premise , too donny and marie ish in some parts and sonny and cher in some others lachey 's performance with babyface is nice how come babyface did n't produce nick 's entire solo album instead of the batch of people nick went to that caused soul o to flop \? he would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to but having mr t and johnny bench and kenny rogers makes the show look , sadly , too 1983 ish how come they could n't get somebody current to perform on it , say maroon 5 or kanye west , who were both hot last april \? they wanted to bring back the variety show format , but it 's very hard to do it in an internet age and jessica is n't all that good on this show i 'd rather hear her music and albums instead they need to bring new things to the format if they 're going to make another show for now , lachey and simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this !
i love love love this movie , but you have to make sure you get the vhs version \( where the vhs cover is the cast riding in the car \) lucky for me , this is the one i own by mistake , i purchased the wrong version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together the music in the dvd version is terrible compared to the original \( do n't even get me started on the c d soundtrack \) whoever made the blunder of re doing this for dvd re release needs to be fired
it is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action comedy hybrid , however it just does n't work the action scenes seem tacked on and the gags just do n't work
instructions rent steven seagall 's latest action movie knuckle fest exit wounds insert in dvd player watch first 15 minutes of movie , remove from dvd player return to video store
i bought this dvd after watching jessica simpson 's latest music video these boots are made for walkin' i thought her reality tour live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed may be ok for those who just want to watch jessica sing
jessica simpson is a talentless bimbo she is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing brittany and christina for showing too much skin we all know now that the hypocritical jessica simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right she is not a role model and her songs tv specials are lower than below average
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
i was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my dvd player and sat down to watch it did n't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film the story was interesting and had it been done in a better way , the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as trick and latter days where the acting and production quality were very good , i found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments it is not a movie i would readily recommend
i just wanted to find out and please let me know dat is the a teens music video heartbreak lullaby which is part of the soundtrack for the movie on the princess diaries dvd lyke as in the bonus features or something \? \? ive been trying find out but i cant so plzz lemme know cuz i just wanna get the dvd for the music video ! !
if you have n't already seen this one , do not wait until tomorrow , do it today
these are old disney shows from 2 series i saw then on the late night vault disney series they were well done and interesting the only problem is that this dvd is only a few \( 6 total \) of the 18 shows so although i would rate the shows as a 4 or 5 , this release gets 1 star for being incomplete
good grief yet another dvd collection we are not buying because disney does n't seem to understand we loved these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete i hope the folks at disney get the message eventually same thing applies to their live action feature films disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production
maybe this is not fair , to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews , and i am not buying this dvd , as swamp fox is incomplete ! three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase
i recently saw les miserables 10th anniversary concert on dvd and absolutely fell in love with it so i thought i would try something similar and decided to give candide try boy , was i disappointed i ca n't get past the first 30 minutes all these silly gimmicky jokes that are not even remotely funny the singing is not bad \( this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in les miz \) but the choreography is trite and unimaginative , and the acting so juvenille that you 'd think the characters are retarded when the narrator fired his gun and a bang flag shot out from the gun instead that was over the top for me yuck
my impression was what a waste of money why take such a nice play and do it like that \? why \? what 's that old lady \? what sort of character mrs lupone built \? i read the reviews here and i did n't believe them i should have had but there are good moments though imaginative , creative , although far from funny
as i write this review , it was 5 years ago this very day that the walt disney co released the classic fantasia for the first time on dvd as a 60th anniversary special edition but exactly 5 years later , you can no longer purchase a legitimate , new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price , via such avenues as ebay
do n't bother just do n't bother it 's sad to see
i hope i can give a fair rating here , but as one member who loves to watch lds films of all types , this one is a big let down i normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good this one was just overkill that was not even funny i initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like nursury comedy if you know what i mean i turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the wedding gown infomercial in a movie
robert wiene 's the cabinet of dr caligari is a celebrated work of german expressionism while there are several interesting facets to it , this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success
there is a coliseum video about the world heavyweight title the tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign that tape is great gorilla moonsoon with the commentary the jr commentary does n't make this garbage any better the matches are like de ja vu let me think yes i have seen these before because these matches are on each and every other dvd the extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change i really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds i know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans i know i voted were the votes counted in florida \? there are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd i got the first disc from netflix because i was not going to buy it some may say he is crazy it was great maybe for you it is i have seen all of that before i wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history there are no perspective segments or interviews just overrated jr running his yap over matches he never called i want to hear the real commentary with jesse not jr but wwe screwed that up there are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now oh i mean entertainment it 's garbage now wwe has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one hitman , jake roberts , road warriors , monday night etc etc the dvds about the old days are the only things i look forward to because their current product is garbage so when the thing i look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if i get a little ticked off experienced wrestling fan get it on netflix or borrow it and go and get the coliseum video if you can find it rookie fan it would be informative to you
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism
i am always up for a new genre of film , but the reviews here are misleading the basic plot of the movie is that life sucks \( yeah thats it \) the rest of it is just sick if your really into perversion then okay you 'd probably get more out of it then i did , but for the viewers who have n't been almost raped by their fathers , or killed their grandparents or shot themselves in public this is n't the movie for you if you still want to see the movie try and get it from netflix or borrow it from a friend before you dish out the cash
a coffee table book come to life , ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid 20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it
there are cinematic masterpieces , and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest this stinker convinced me mr lynch owned shares in kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile the only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a david lynch work ever again do not buy it ! ! manos , the hands of fate is much more watchable than this
how he gets away with it i will never understand orson welles was a clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms \( that 's what you do when you ca n't make art \) do n't worry , there is always rossellini , fellini , renoir , bergman , dreyer
the criterion collection , a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films , is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award winning , original supplements the foundation of the collection is the work of such \( real \) masters of cinema as renoir , godard , kurosawa , cocteau , fellini , bergman , tarkovsky , hitchcock , fuller , lean , kubrick , lang , sturges , dreyer , eisenstein , ozu , sirk , bunuel , powell and pressburger
this was not very good , in my opinion the ring scared the bejeezus outta me this was not scary two weeks afterwards , i still find my mind wandering about one thing why the heck did n't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room \? if i walk into my house and see a half naked boy meowing and hissing at me , i'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
while viewing the dvd elizabeth i , we noticed many imperfections requiring restarts and or interruptions of our viewing this is the first dvd that we have ever seen with imperfections
this story is one of the worst fantasy stories ever it is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo christian story line do n't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to lord of the rings or harry potter for original \( not to mention secular \) fantasy and escape
i did n't like this video for several reasons the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands i was looking for an aerobic video i have gilad bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years let me just say i'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me you do n't even feel like you had a workout with her she 's boring i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning tamilee is awesome i have many of her videos and i'm a true fan of hers
this program was boring ! as much as billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated , about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were , and of course my kids at home , and i'm sure any other kid picked up on this , and soon lost interest
this movie does not make sense and it 's not weird in the style of david lynch , it 's just complete crap i thought willie wonka and the chocolate factory was the worst stupidest fil ever until i saw this do not buy this it is not a family movie , and it is not funny or entertaining
i purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since gone with the wind give me a break !
i agree with others ! season by season box sets of beavis butt head are what we fans want ! with all music and b b commentary and no damned edits of anything !
i dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv the videos were the best part ! i asume its because mtv did n't want to pay royalties to the bands , so they called it the mike judge collection and left them out uh , that sucks
i bought this dvd hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy there is no story or plot to it , so i ended up throwing it away i really regret buying it
each scene is one shot , and that shot goes on and on and on , sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action this film is pretension personified , but that 's okay many people ca n't tell the difference between pretension and art the music too is full of squeaks and squawks in case you did n't know , that means that the music too is high art
warning spoiler
geez , maybe i have a heart of stone i was n't a bit moved by the overrated streep and handsome clint it 's a story about two hearts linked as one a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy , bored adults yawwwwn streep can do any accent on the planet , and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than marcel marceau that does n't make her an actress just a clever chameleon i 'd rather watch julia roberts play herself over and over and over than see streep play pretend roles there , i 've said it now goodnight
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no , not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids , that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack , a travesty to the nth degree
legal eagles is supposed to be a comedy we 're supposed to find the characters played by robert redford and debra winger to be amusing , their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious , and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying
this is entertainment \? wow , exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat
so so movie it has it 's good parts along with some boring parts but overall , good special effects with the ghosts there were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch when a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew , he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of many ghosts just a ok movie
thirteen ghosts is about a machine this machine was designed by a man who was at the time possessed my satan yes , satan if the plot does n't seem stupid enough , it needs ghosts to power it ghostbusters anyone \? at the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a michael j fox movie as time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts if done right , it opens the 'eye to hell'
i generally like some of these french comic books turned into movies because they 're usually pretty erotic jane fonda 's role in barbarella comes to mind this gwendoline series definitely had the potential what with the scantily clad women in bondage theme and the scenes involving gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend
harold ramis 's the ice harvest wallows in mid market crime and holiday angst , but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires all the ingredients are there , but ultimately the movie lacks spice in some movies , it works where all the characters move at a slow pace nobody 's fool , for example but a dark comedy needs some pep , and the ice harvest does n't have it
long , tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog , bad plot holes , and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from bad boys
after 40 minutes of objective viewing , and shot after superfluous shot , i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not , or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from higher ups kong is not an epic , it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing , if you will , but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in , i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this mr jackson , no more 'epic fly by shots please
eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention , but overall the movie displayed poor acting , stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot this movie possibly will be owned by many , but remembered by few james caan was the only talent that eraser has to offer sorry guys , my wife bought it , i watched it , gave it away and divorced her
this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it 's the michael jackson ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww \? it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe , what does that mean \? when are screenwriters going to figure it out \? either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids , they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton , if you are not a fan of either , do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !
seems like this video could be useful , but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it , yet alone trying to work out to it some of the moves were cool , but all in all i will trade this in for something else
george sluizer 's original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version , you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head , but the film had plenty more to offer than that , playing with chronology , subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes' plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself , but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered
joel hershman 's greenfingers , starring the now famous \( and utterly gorgeous \) clive owen and helen mirren , is a sweet , cutesy , and utterly empty british romantic comedy in this forgettable , generic chick flick , inmates at a british minimum security prison take up gardening initially , they are understandably reluctant to garden but , get this , gardening ends up changing their lives ! and , after his parole , owen 's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden ! and mirren 's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her ! wow , where do people get this stuff \?
the flight into new york had been a long one but i was gently revived when kirsten dunst met me at the airport she was to be my escort that night at the lincoln center where the president would present me the distinguished writer 's cross the highest award this nation can bestow on an author i quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her mercedes s class sedan to the waldorf astoria downtown
someone bought this 3d dvd for my almost 5 year old daughter we thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were however , within minutes of the movie 's beginning my daughter was in tears i wo n't say why but she found the plot frightening several times during the movie i tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end fortunately the movie is relatively short overall , i found the story to be a cynical look at christmas as an adult , i think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of christmas shopping but i urge caution before showing it to young children there was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of christmas
wow hard to put into words how bad this was we kept waiting for the funny it never came we did n't even watch the end when they started turning julia roberts \( tess \) into the real julia roberts well we were done note funny no
the movie itself is just as good i remembered it but the criterion collection dvd package , however , is so totally not worth the 40 plus postage i paid for it i 've gotten so much more bang for my buck with other special edition type dvds i found the interviews and extra stuff dull i want my money back
it is unusual that i disagree with so many great critics praising a movie where there is so much talent this movie tries to deal with alot and does alot of it well but as a viewer , i am hugely distracted by mamet 's dialogue no , i do not agree that people in the real business world talk like this ! real people do not mindlessly echo over and over and over the same phrases that they hear each other speaking if i did that in my working environment my coworkers would think there was something wrong with me real conversation does not run in that kind of patter after listening to the characters for ninety minutes , i finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was mamet real people talk differently from each other they use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang i 've had this problem with mamet before and i ca n't believe nobody has ever noticed this before and i would doubt that i am the first i would n't be surprised if somewhere some actor in some mamet production has pondered this before come on ! good dialogue is like good acting if it 's really good , you do n't notice it until the show 's over
what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic , maybe , but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i could n't understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage 's character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex , violence , or rough language although cage does get shot in one hold up scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they should n't have changed it so much or they should n't have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together
this is a review of the ultimate collector 's edition , not a review of the film itself if you 're considering the purchase of a two disc special edition , you probably already know that the film is great you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag
old movies are great i 've been waiting for the release of oklahoma ! in the new technology dvd format i wanted to use my new dvd up converter i have the laser disk version , and after reading the reviews , i will keep it until fox gets its act totether fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here until i know it 's at least as good as my outdated laser disk , i 'll wait
do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do , you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring
this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin
this is the worst asian movie that i have ever seen the story is dumb and does n't make any sense , especially the ending and to top it off it is n't that scary it only gets a little bit scary at the end
if this movie was ever going to have a chance , it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long , or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just ca n't be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just was n't time enough , i guess , to develop the characters , or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating , and we are left with painful stereotypes and , in the case of roland michell , a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you 've read the book , skip the movie , but if you saw the movie , you should do yourself a favor and get the book
why release wrestlemaina 's that are already on dvd \? anther thing wrestlemaina is months away , it was a perfect time to release the big four in order survivor series entire series , then royal rumble , then wrestlemaina , and finally summerslam made sense but wwe really doesnt think well sometimes
well , this dvd is pretty bad , like everyone else said it 's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14 , with narration from each character in the background i believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they were n't getting high ratings on the anime series anyway , i did n't buy this dvd , because i have the japanese box set instead , which saved me a lot of i watched each episode , and i must say the only part i liked was the opening and ending theme other than that , there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die hard wolf 's rain fan but , do n't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window i really highly recommend renting this before you buy it , cause otherwise you are wasting your money
what really bothered me about hudsucker proxy capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone , even communist slaves and fascist toady 's under a democratic people yet , hollywood insists on blasting corporate culture , when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest , they are exemplary
i bought this back in october of 2006 can someone who bought it more recently tell me if the sound issues have been fixed \? i returned this item for a refund and wo n't be buying it again until paramount fixes the sound issues parts of the show are very quiet i had to turn the sound up to even make out the dialog then , a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers this happens multiple times per episode repeat this for six hours if i wanted this kind of quality , i 'd just download the episodes off the internet there will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed i do n't know why they ca n't pay someone 5 15 an hour to watch the dvd once before they make 10 million copies
trying to make a film concerning studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea it 's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on from what i understand , the original director 's cut was gutted by miramax before the film was released it and it shows other than mike meyers portrayal of steve rubell , there 's hardly a gay character in sight there 's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake
i guess when any era becomes old enough for the nostaglia craze to hit , we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying case in point the 1950 's were not such an innocent age , and the 1970 's were not that wild
wow , what a bore the old stock footage is uneven and does n't show enough of the truck other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street the song is ok , but once that 's over my son walks away why would a child who loves trucks walk away \? because some guy 's voice \( which sounds like it 's in an echo chamber \) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he ca n't see on the screen what 's on the screen \? more garbage stock footage this looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone 's basement
i own several real wheels movies and thought i would give this one a shot i found the picture quality to be less than i expected and the footage seemed out of date the narration was dull and boring , and the children 's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying i would recommend any of the real wheels series instead of this they never fail to please my 3 1 2 year old truck lover
i'm of the opinion that king 's books rarely translate well into movies , and this is no exception some of king 's work is fantastic , but unfortunately , a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new this falls into the latter category
filming the story of gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio , from warner brothers to bbc the virgin queen still retains her power to enthrall , intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne she was perhaps england 's last true absolute monarch , and certainly one of its greatest , if not most famous
as much as i like paul newman , this movie is very disappointing once you 've seen the far superior film day one the portrayal of oppenheimer and groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people the movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the manhatten project

do n't waste your time i usually give low budget horror a chance and i have an open mind , but this movie is utterly ridiculous
to be fair , the legends of herakles , as they were originally written , have little to do with this movie , but maybe that 's for the best having grown up on superman , batman and the justice league , i have a hard time calling a person like herakles a hero in the original legends , he was a warrior , but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage he also was n't , as far as i can tell , as strong as in this version
this is poorly casted and scripted movie , has only one thing going for it , no annoying chevy chase around to make unfunny jokes , he did not have too , the cast here do that in abundance
this is the first time i have ever purchased a the firm dvd i was really disappointed in this one many of the moves are not properly explained some movements target only one side of the body and they do n't bother having you switch sides to work the other \( really obvious in the salsa style section \) it took a few times of doing to get all the moves right , but even after that it barely raises the heart rate the warm up leaves much to be desired the cool down continues the dance movements but at a slower rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching i am used to denise austin workouts , that are half the length but you actually feel like you did something when you are done not so with this workout at all definately a waste for someone who is n't just starting out
pearl jam seem to be making a comeback witht their live performances at present , but this dvd shows the band at a less than impressive peak
pearl jam used to be good , now they 're just a joke and this dvd shows it
ladder 49 was not the type of film i expected i was hoping for a good , fast paced action flick , which i got for about the first 5 minutes the remainder of the 30 minutes that i watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter 's first days at the station
i have been a huge fan of l m montgomery 's work since i was an eleven year old girl living in the caribbean i 've read and re read , and re read her stories again and again , and ca n't seem to get enough the first two film installments in the anne of green gables story are warm , beautiful , funny , inspiring and moving pieces of work , that are more or less faithful to montgomery 's original novels
american pie an immature , mindless , vapid , boring , blandly disgusting , humor lacking piece of over rated trash packed full of cliches , highschool sterotypes , annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade a douchebags
the lack of liam neeson and raimi 's directing is what ruined this movie for me while mr vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the liam created character and mr drake always has appeal , the movie as a whole needed a much better script it was too predicatble , too phoney
this is one of my favorite romantic comedies it is funny , touching , and has some of my favorite actors in it and it does n't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people !
absolutely unwatchable cliche ridden so silly it 's very nearly offensive it 's like watching one long music video by a b level rapper full of dumb , beautiful women , buff , monkey headed ghetto thugs , and jokey tricked out cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the script is laughable , the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber than butch cassidy and the sundance kid awful
a dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the us and abroad i was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting i enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen , but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target , i think it 's just a shame
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known hollywood cliche in film making i applaud the effort the chicks in this film are happening babes fo sho but there ai n't much to the film but it has some fun to it
ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film
the kit was not worth its price the spatial effect is poor i 've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red blue paper glasses no , i do n't have visual problem , and i rigged up everything correctly
for months , disney advertised this as a 2 disc special edition dvd but at the last minute , that second disc mysteriously disappeared why \? this is false advertising , and if i had my way , disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands it 's unfair to force people who really want a 2 disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a region free player they did this same crap to alice in wonderland , but the other way around uk lost a disc that we have , and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the 2 and 4 disc editions in the us , but not in the uk , and giving fans in the us a 3 disc edition i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world
this movie was so boring and stupid , i turned it off after about 45 minutes maybe i had a poor copy , but i could barely understand what paula prentiss was saying and it was n't because she was under the influence ! i ran it back a few times but still could n't make it out from the other reviewers , it sounds like it got better but , if something does n't grab my attention after 30 minutes , i say forget it
i loved the original movie , and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be awesome wrong wrong wrong ! ! first of all , the child actors were horrible , well the charlie and mike characters were ok , but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp \? he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater , and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
i found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time it 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning the ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion denzel washington did a great job playing the detective and john goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted my recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money buy somthing that has a good plot d is my ratin
i practically fell asleep while watching this tape , the girl doing the exercises is n't even saying anything while she 's doing it it 's a voice over ! also she 's all alone in a blank room all the exercises are basically the same i would suggest mtv pilates it 's a lot more fun
i bought this dvd to replace a worn video from the bbc \( british broadcasting commission \) it was a bit of a shock the original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through it also now has a poor voice over the whole feel of the film has been removed all the pbs and viewers like your rubbish \? where 'd that come from it was totallly funded via the bbc the pbs editions mess up may have been funded by someone else my copy is going free as i wo n't be watching it again
opened the sealed dvd case and get shorty was inside and not the usual suspects i sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement i got a credit , i think not sure i would rather just have the correct movie
i really want to give this piece of garbage a zero actually , i only watched part of one episode , i do n't know if it 's from season one i am a columbo fan , and a detective writer i saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform the platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in ! a toilet with flowers in it he reacts to colds \? i saw a classroom full of kids every one had a cold ! not very realistic kiddie video game pacing , with no proper build up they do n't make stuff for intelligent people anymore ! if you are new to this series , watch some before you buy maybe some of it is ok
some idiot edited this and put two bars on the top and bottom that are part of the video so in you watch this on a laptop or widescreen tv you will also get two bars on this side this means that when you view it , it takes up about 25 35 of the screen with four black bars taking up most of the screen i could not even watch 5 minutes of this complete trash
the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor , but there 's no mystery
honestly , nothing about this show grabs me i'm surprised this show gets such high nielsen ratings every week the writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time but the biggest flaw is the acting it is really laughable me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be horatio caine talks in a slow drawl all the time , saying the stupidest and most obvious things calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating none of the c s i team displays any emotion whatsoever , oh except horatio when he over does it
this is his absolute worst videos , not his best you are missing tons of classic moments such as when doves cry , let 's go crazy , mountains , girls and boys , batdance , partyman , scandalous , automatic , why you wanna treat me so bad \? , sexuality , i wish u heaven , glam slam , anotherloverholenyohead , america , and thieves in the temple this is a crime when is the real dvd coming out
i'm a fan of the 1999 the mummy and was understandably looking forward to this sequel in the summer of 2001 i went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and f x we just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium
charlize theron , her real life boyfriend stuart townsend , and penelope cruz are all nice to look at , and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work , theron having won as osca for her role in monster
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen , no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get not even samuel jackson 's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie horrible awful
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern 's classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch why \? depp 's performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off putting , flat , self absorbed , and finally , one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog not much holidday fun , huh \? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio
this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont , i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it unfortunately , i was wrong
here 's the awful truth
i preface all of my dvd reviews with the following note there are more than enough film reviews on amazon com and , quite frankly , it 's a bit ridiculous a person can scroll through scores pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the dvd if you want to review or discuss a film , go to imdb if you 're reviewing the dvd , speak to the qualities \( or lack thereof \) of the audio and video mention your opinions of the plot , acting , etc but please do n't write an essay !
i did not much enjoy this film , and i did n't find it very clever or funny
i have never been a demi moore fan , but this movie is even worse than i imagined it would be my kids picked it up in the videotheque i decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them demi 's acting is rather passionless , poor and disconnected she looks old too ! she does n't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too after just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in scotland to write a new novel yeah , sure that 's what i would do after losing my only child i probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so after five minutes you do n't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her you can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen and all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly a guy who is alone on an island for years who does n't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it and who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly a mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere i expected a film with supernatural elements , but boy did i get fooled some of the photography and scenery was acceptable , but the cgi generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly alas , not a film that i can recommend to anyone
half light \( craig rosenberg , 2006 \)
i 've owned the laserdisc version of new order story for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week , so i thought having the dvd version would be an upgrade not at all , it 's a cheap transfer from laserdisc the dvd containing a collection has defects in it i mainly bought it so i could have the full version of the promo for the perfect kiss , which in story is almost ruined by bono 's horrible voice but it turns out it has a huge skip in the dvd version i did n't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it
the editor decided that i do n't want to see how the plane crashes into wtc , or how people jump from windows , so , he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else instead , there is a plenty of news people 's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking \( and why do i care \? \) , plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left
this dvd is edited from the original version this movie is hot , the cut dvd is not
seeing what 's become of the rock and roll legends i remember from when we were much younger , i found very depressing i 'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago even jerry lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home
absolute dog poop with corn so there is this joke that all the comedians know about , and there are a million ways to tell it , and they get really raunchy there , that 's the movie i saved you two hours oh but there 's a kicker , the joke is n't funny and everyone knows it yet , of course , some of the comedians tell it like it 's the funniest thing in the world sarah silverman , gilbert godfried , bob sagat , and south park are definite highlights and i love sarah silverman however , the awful cinematography , horrific editing , and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people did n't burn down the theaters when they realized this film was n't getting any better i would have at least demanded a refund , and 100 hr billed in 15 minute increments i think sarah silverman saved the day again
so i'm supposed to believe that the horrible dialogue , bad acting , and ridiculous plotting is on purpose just because mamet is a respected guy \? how about we call a dog a dog and just move on
this show is my all time favorite , however universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser , and a wrong season premier intro !
this documentary is poorly produced , has terrible sound quality and stereotypical life affirming stories there was nothing in here to support wal mart , their business practices or their philosophy
first of all , i am a joy division and new order fan therefore , i tried to like this really , i did
i'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does , i suppose most are simply glad the show is available on dvd however , the transfer to dvd is absolutely horrible on an opening night shot on disc 1 , there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs inside the house ! the colors on these prints are n't even as good as what is shown on tvland this show might be 30 years old , but they cannot be using the best prints available there is another irritating tip off of the cheapness of this package the music on the closing credits is wrong or is this my imagination \?
first let me say that i thought angela 's ashes was an absolutely terrific book and frank mccourt fully deserved his pulitzer prize this movie was a horrendous let down no one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty everything was a hollywood version of suffering and misery , from emily watson 's pretty red coat standing in for the real angela 's gray rag to the beautifully lit irish streets and of course john let me tell you how you 're supposed to feel right now williams' cloying , inappropriate music
this is a made for tv movie and not the original film do not waste your money on this re make buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred robert blake
highly acclaimed that , i knew i watched the first 30 minutes , which is 1 4 of the movie , before i decided to hang it up new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop this upsets the local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate okay can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot \? nope this one 's boring
i saw this movie yesterday thinking it 'd be exciting i sure am glad that i survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie there 's no story line , the acting is pathetic , whoever gave vin diesel the idea that he can act like an earlier reviewer observes it 's about who 's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review
i ca n't give it any less than one star but what the heck , the girls were hot so there 's the one star other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie ! i swear to god ! i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe ! they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job ! even if they just ran around the set yelling 1 , 2 , 3 , potato salad , march ! the dialogue would have been 1000 times better message to the producer
i love chazz p and i can see why he would want to give the other side of the castellano epic , but man is this movie boring castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family if you know the history of this guy , than you should agree , and if you do n't , read some books about him as powerful as he was , he sure did n't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors , which this film does n't portray the film also has terrible actors portraying both sammy the bull and john gotti an insult at that if you like mafia movies and do n't care about the history of its real life characters than by all means watch it if you do , skip it , you 'd be better off reading a book
to violent for anyone ! this movie is horrible the cast is good , but the plot stinks ! its just this family who have super powers then this kid wanted to be mr incredibles side kick \( in a way \) mr incredible says no so then he hates him then the kid turns evil and kills people , and wants every body to like him thats origanal there are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , and there is way to much violence killing , guns , punching , bombs , and they say stupid words sometimes i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence so i do not recommend this movie to anyone especially the 2 disc special edition !
well what can i say about this movie \? well one thing is it was n't what i 'd expected those who 'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but i still wanted to see it i was wrong and they were right
being a huge fan of sandra bullock , i bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work nope , this movie is garbage first thing i noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots the acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous over all , it 's not a movie worth buying
i have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by dhl global mail

well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately the female teenage protagonist \( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here \) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal but that 's why they call them movies when are these post modern writers , artists , and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them , not compete with them men crave femininity in females , not feminism wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut , if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations
having watched great movies in the bible series such as joseph , david , abraham , jacob , moses and samson and delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures , i was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film what a let down by this anachronism how low can one go ! this is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of god
this movie is not very realistic the sets are great ! , but the story is a biblical snafu ! they had the chance to embellish the real story , without compromizing the bible 's account , but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later , which impeached any incredibility it might have had i did n't like it much for that reason
the ring two is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary naomi watts and david dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of samara , the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film however , like any specter worth her salt , samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living

i bought 2 barbie dvd and this is one of them it 's dark and scary at the beginning and the story line is not that great compare with the other one i have \( mermaidia \) it does n't attract my daughter like mermaidia and she does n't like it that much do n't buy this get the mermaidia one
my daughters are not barbie doll fans but they do like the movies so do i
could have been a truly interesting film , just plain simpleminded and annoying
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved \? they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use \? which drugs \? presumably they 're talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let 's not talk about that let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him \? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they do n't even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined \? why do n't they address this \? this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking
if you love hip hop then do n't buy this video it 's a mix of movements that are not hip hop
michael moore filmed this propaganda , partially financed by the united auto workers , to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion , made possible by gm 's unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages , something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes
this is a pretty good collection for the mickey beginner i would n't purchase it however if you already have the walt disney treasures mickey mouse in living color series because all the shorts are on those dvds as well
those who describe this story as cute and joon as quirky are n't paying attention for me , this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity the writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness yes , depp is great , given what he has to work with , but overall i am very sorry that i was subjected to this horribly stupid , insensitive movie
with great music and a setting that reminds you of vampire hunter d it sucks you into watching the series the plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing the animation is good , which is a must have for me , but it was n't enough to redeem the series
i only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the twins really bad acting and plot that makes little sense trying to be like the original movie but falls way short its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters not worth it except for the brief shower scene
i normally praise disney 's animated movies , but i 've got to draw the line somewhere i ca n't believe the average review for this movie was 41 2 stars i found the characters in this movie annoying , even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff i urge you to buy treasure planet , any disney pixar film , tarzan before this one
there are two main reasons why this superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects
what looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment whilst you expect some plot to come together \( at least on first viewing \) it is strung together to confuse even to frustrate the viewer
i was seriously considering purchasing this movie , but luckily i saw it at blockbuster one night and decided to rent it before i made up my mind i think it was the smartest move i 've made in my entire life because this movie turned out to be , not only the worst lesbian movie , but probably one of the worst movies ever made ! the reviews i 've seen for this movie are way too generous i must say believe me when i say that i am not a strict critic i can be easily entertained by the corny ones but this one could not be salvaged , and one star is much more than it deserves the fact that is in black and white can be overlooked , but the bad acting , and pseudo artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school unfortunately , my girlfriend and i were unable to get through the first 30 mins , so i am unable to rate this movie wholly all i can say is please rent it at least
i was really looking forward to movie my goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50 's westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing , these alone did not turn me off from watching my real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting within the first 10 minutes of the movie , a stage coach is robbed , my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors they were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers later , when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them , the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that i laughed as the movie plodded forward , scene after scene left me wondering , how quickly was this thrown together and how come they did n't rehearse more i felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment i generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly , i think it was an embarrassment and waste of time maybe it got better \( that is why i gave it two stars \) but i find that doubtful i am wondering if both tom berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of script writing 101
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star \? sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood , killing , and the like it was totally historically inaccurate , and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow , without even aiming the canon , he knocks his 'friend' off his horse
cinema wise , you know you 're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best hollywood can come up with is a sequel to a remake \( it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film \) but that is exactly what cheaper by the dozen 2 turns out to be and the result , quality wise , is pretty much what one would expect
after reading the novel by jane yolen with my 7th grade classes , i was eager to view the film version i had heard conflicting views of the film it 's great , it 's horrible , etc after viewing it for myself , i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews however , despite its lack luster performance , the film did serve a purpose in the classroom
this is a goody goody ronald reagan propaganda style film by that i mean that it tries to portray the us as the good guys being hit by the bad ones it does n't say what dirty role the us cia had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis islam , how it set up , equipped and nurtured not only bin laden and his al qaeda , but a whole bunch of other loathsome islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe like the islamic brotherhood and the taliban for instance all just to defeat the ussr , and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions , to fuel the greedy american consumerist lifestyle which us citizens take so much for granted i am not a conspiracy theorist these people are usually an absurd breed , going off at the other extreme tangent i live in peshawar , the hotbed of cia mischief in the 1980s and 90s \( and even now \) , and the area where i live the university town housed all the actors on this stage the us officials and spies , their clubs , the afghan mujahideen leaders' houses , etc etc i grew up seeing all this going on literally next door , and so would like to apprise my american friends of the unpleasant truth the national geographic and the reader 's digest magazines are two long established icons of us media culture that have served as the unofficial \( and therefore hard to suspect \) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous us propaganda drives never trust their political commentaries , although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice
personally , i ca n't see this movie for dust in fact , i find it extremely annoying the only video worse than this one is monty python and the holy grail yecch !
i was disapointd in this show it was mad and release by warners \( marvel 's biggest rival and dc 's parent company \) , this new take on the x men had them behave like horny teenage doofuses , and do n't get me started on the crappy writing just like x2 was not the x men , this show was also the same it was in name only , and speaking as the only loyal marvel fan here , that says i all
this movie is just not scary i'm a huge horror movie fan and this movie has no tension in it , no edge of your seat fear i liked the sequel devil 's rejects , but that is n't much of a horror movie either \( unless you think from dusk til dawn is scary \) 1 , 000 corpses is about as scary as hostel it should never be mentioned in the same breath as texas chainsaw , because other than trying to look like a gritty 70 's horror flick , it has nothing in common with chainsaw
in essence , this is a texas chainsaw remake , but here 's the difference , and why it 's far inferior i do n't care one iota for the victims i can barely tell the females apart the guys are so obnoxious , i look forward to them dying unlike texas chainsaw \( parts one and two , horror masterpieces ! \) , this movie shows the psycho family \( hmmm kind of like texas chainsaw \? \) far too much a little goes a long way , too much \? overkill ! many plot holes , and take away the music , there was some really bad acting it gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style , and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed but in general , rob zombie should not get writing credit for this it 's texas chainsaw massacre , only nowhere near as good
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible , horrible film mindless , drawn out banter , and weak story line our copy eventually broke \( stepped on \? \) we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star seems like a generous rating
okay , the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen , but i like the actors \( especially ben 's best man \) so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot , such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones \? or at least , why do n't they use them \? oh no , much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor charade was so predictable oh gee , he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and dr holmes might have to step up \? and uh , they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gonna get busted \?
there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end , whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort , but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film , you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed , the lines could have been written the night before , and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic , the violins would always shrill around kiefer , and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement , no frills , nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films , which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end
this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some well known actors , and a notable director , the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night tv movie with profanity inserted to liven it up
subtitled guy 's mom is sick the guy is also depressed meets a ex hustler on beach they kiss , fight , make up , over and over \( most of the movie \) they break up boy meets hustler 's ex and they play with dog on beach the end
i saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him \( he was seeing it for a second time \) after the first ten minutes , i wanted to leave if you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb american youth from small , hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local wal mart or becoming mince meat in iraq , then this movie is for you ! however , if you like movies that actually challenge you to think , do n't waste your time with this one
this terrible movie has singing ! bad singing , and lots of it ! overacted , trite , and boring ! all those good reviews , i thought it would be campy and cool , but it 's not !
i absolutely abhor this film want to know why \? because it labled 'valley of the dolls' and everything jacqueline susann ever wrote into 'great campy fun' now i do n't know this for certain , but i do n't think jacqueline susann wanted people to see her books as cheesy comedies i think she wanted people to take her work seriously , and with this awfully made film , no one did to others , the film might be so bad it 's funny , but to devoted fans of the book it 's just depressing the movie was made in 1967 , a year after the book was published and you can see that jacqueline susann was ahead of her time , because the film is poorly adapted and very censored you know you have a problem when the book would receive an r rating if transferred onto the screen , but the movie is only rated pg besides the sex scenes , language , pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out , important details to the plot are also missing anne 's hatred of lawrenceville , helen lawson 's screen time , jennifer 's complicated and somewhat absuive relationship with tony , allen and gino cooper , henry 's character development , jennifer 's relationship with the senator \( and the reason she committs suicide \) , the tragic ending , etc are all either missing or are shortened down i do n't care if the movie would have been almost three hours long , i think if they had stuck close enough to the book , then everything would have been fine what a shame and please do n't mention the casting of actors save for patty duke , i thought everyone else did a horrible job some of the actors did n't even look the physical part \( in the book anne is actually a blonde , helen lawson has dark hair and jennifer is curvy \) the thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade \? it 's almost forty years later , and i think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation how about kate bosworth as anne welles , scarlett johansson as jennifer north , keira knightly as neely o'hara , joaquin phoenix as lyon burke , and liza minnelli as helen lawson \? well i doubt that will ever happen , so in the meantime i recommend reading the book instead , and taking it seriously the way jacqueline susann had intended it to be
nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment , as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else \? the songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals , which arguably were n't that bad \( what a girl wants and get this party started were fairly tame to begin with \) just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds
this is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film 's deeping meaning i am sure that i missed much of that meaning however , one aspect of it is painful clear the crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation i found that premise disturbing and unrealistic also , it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex if so , this movie could contribute , in a small way , to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof
simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin \( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince \( why \? \) \) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so , a kid dies , which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around , why , no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship
the premise that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i do n't condemn the film 's corollary either that each change produces new , unforseeable tragedies it 's the way the story is told its ham fisted dialogue and plot , its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities
you only need to read the book by whitley strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is
since we know there is another version of burn out there , i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes com and get an idea of its quality you can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan , poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued brando told larry king it was his favorite film not if he saw this package
read the amazon editorial review , they are tiptoeing around saying this movie does n't really work
there is a certain new fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound , then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash , but at least that was \( somewhat \) assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours , and as much as i \( usually \) enjoy george clooney , i might never forgive him for this drek
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally , i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however , in this film , their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script , editing , and direction which made this film quite dull to watch
this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery
in the early 1990 's this movie was definitely made for that era just look at the clothing and hair high top fades etc graffiti bridge was definitely unique it should have been released on cable t v instead of the theater it was more of a musical then a actual movie prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world and he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out , but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing the talent he has is amazing but he 's become just a mediocur artist this lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now but as of now it 's just what you call a get up and walk out film i'm a prince fanatic , a die hard fan , but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet you haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate if only prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet i think he shut the world out and it just went on turning record sales may not matter to him , but fans you must keep loyal graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and i just look at it as my collection but nothing more it 's a film that makes you think it 's spiritual and there are some warm moments now purple rain is something not to be missed i recommend that one enjoy
oh man , this is really \( \) ! ! !
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here , years later , when i'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
i recently purchased this dvd and was beyond disappointed with it i actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it i expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there , with the firemen , or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent i can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it 's hard to make out the film has a few comments by the person taping it but that 's it the film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble i found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom i own several other documentaries that i watch over and over as i do n't want to forget the feelings i felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country this dvd was a huge waste of both my time and money
like other reviewers , i found meetthe parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for 25 bin at hollywood so i figured why not \?
i 'll cut to the meta chase since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews
yes , this is a supernatural psycological thriller but far from a good one as far as i'm concerned
sit down under a tree , give it a big hug , fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs !
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout , i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it , but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this , but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
i saw this movie for the first time , and i found out that it is very very violent and i laughed at some good parts , but the scene where amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese 's wing is not what you want your kids to see
the dvd is really a deception all the experts invited are the ones that support gnostic theory i was hoping that i can see a balanced view related to this subject instead , i only see the point of view of the pro dan brown 's experts i think we should invite the famous evangelists , theologists , and scholars from the protestant , cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue the dvd does not even discuss why the gnostic theory was rejected in the first century
sat down and saw this one on televion
period dramas are , by definition , delicate commodities they 're balanced on that , ahem , razor 's edge between high brow and just plain fussiness
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens , very disapointtin
this is not a good movie ! bad acting , story , and picture ! i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it
i really enjoy both nathan lane matthew brodderick i'm a marginal fan of will ferrell \( in this movie , i thought he was way over the top \) and it seems , nothing in this movie musical really gels
the biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions witch hunter robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime i did n't like it i found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so that 's it \? ' ending i hated
hi folks ,
i made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars \( 4 \) it received from other viewers the plot was butchered , the characters twisted , the story ruined , a pure agony
i 'll be right up front and admit that i do not own this dvd i hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact but then i realized that if you 're reviewing a dvd , 90 of the review must be based on the movie itself , and having saw the movie when it was released , and having seen it again on the various cable channels , i felt i could write a respectable reveiw
this series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12 year old , but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters most of the plot 's famous unpleasantness is just tacked on to the main story , and is of no significance
alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority the character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by aristotle watching this movie you get the feeling that alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident
how do you spell 'sucks' \? easy a l e x a n d e r !
great movie the problem is in the medium of delivery there are 2 dvds in the package each dvd contains approximately 1 2 of the movie the audience customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd
the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good in fact , it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we do n't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor \( the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates \) she was , however , but we the audience do n't know that however , the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam , is unexplained , especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin , however it turns out she is n't , so that 's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes fortunately , we 're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies , either , so this does n't turn into a soap opera however , we do have the dreamboat hero who dreams up the rumor about her being raped , and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that 's true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable , being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film , 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character , and it 's his story we 're following , whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film , and basically it 's her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out , and everyone else \( in a way , the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement \) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth , though the characters do n't have the same truth in mind it 's about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it 's not the comic book variety , is n't fun for an audience , it 's just distasteful in other words , the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves , and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first half hour and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment \? we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story , so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved , it might be worth viewing , if only once , but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that 's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip , or in this case deliberate lies , is that what goes around comes around , and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first 30 45 min then quit midway , but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once , just to be sure where this is headed
this movie is one of the 3 worst movies i 've ever seen
this tepid , disappointing sequel is far better than beyond the re animator but dose n't equal a good sequel to the excellent original dr herbert west and his friend dan re animate dead bodies and when dan 's girlfriend is dying she is re animated just like bride of frankenstein the gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along the new director brian yuzna does a good job taking over stuart gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a sci fi channel movie that would debut on tv and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast \( except jeffrey combs and bruce abbott \) , lower production values and lower budget , and tepid to atrocious acting if you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of beyond the re animator
there is one thing i finally grasped upon watching 'the 40 year old virgin' , however i came to the realization that hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique \( 'the 40 year old virgin' \) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas
one of the most overrated comedy shows ever basically the calibre of a high school talent show in a way it reminds me of tom goes to the mayor , seemingly fitting into a comedy niche i do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever , but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird i 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head i think these guys took that a bit too much to heart maybe the fans see some subtle naunces i'm missing , but to me it seems like i could have written most of this material with little effort
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portraying
i recently purchased the first house movie , i remember watching it as a kid , it was apparently alot scarier during my adolesence , anyways the second one came with it for free , and i must say it was garbage , i did not have the patience to sit thru this crap , i now use this dvd disc as a cup coaster peace
i was a fan of house \( the first of the series \) and so purchased the combo dvd set of house and house 2 i watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while house is pretty good , house 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on it is really quite dumb , but some of the creatures \( i e catter dog as i like to call him \) are kind of fun to see i would suggest skipping the second house unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be
the beginning is very well done , then the only interesting parts are the cat and mouse between jude law and ed harris the rest of the film is bad , i 'd say luckily , i recorded it from tv it is now erased \( by the way , one of the amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that bob hoskins is american he 's from england
this was the most obnoxious time waster i have ever witnessed i kept waiting for the monty python troup to show up the acting was horrid what was with the rocks and urinating on the door \? \? i found myself rooting for grendel of the 33 people in the theater , 10 got up and left half way through this was a story of great heros , not neurotic children too bad gerard butler 's career has come to this i hope the beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview i would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work
for a topic this edgy , this is an incredibly dull film the actors are good enough , mind you but they can only do so much , because the real problem with this film is the script for the first twenty minutes or so of screen time , the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother \( you might not pick up on that fact at first , since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film certainly the two look nothing alike \) finally the main part of the plot begins , with natalie just as discontented , despite being married to a wealthy and quirky but ultimately nice guy \( alan rickman , for whose sake i watched this film at all not worth it \) , and with her brother seemingly happy with his life , but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister from that point , things spiral no , that 's too dynamic a word to describe it mosey out of control , with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair , the poor brother \( the only particularly sympathetic character in the film \) becoming obsessed with the relationship , and the worried hubby 's suspicions growing \( although not in the right direction \) there 's so much here that could have been fascinating and compelling , but is n't , on any level the plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi believable situation , scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet this video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops mercifully for the public but i certainly would n't recommend resorting to buying it
i was n't impressed by this film first of all , i could never buy that saskia reeves and clive owen were a brother and sister nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother sister relationship they might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems , because that 's how the relationship came across
this dvd is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost the film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes the acting is hopeless really , really bad ! although there are many soldiers involved in the battle scenes , it 's all pretty unconvincing , considering the carnage of the real conflict in all honesty , as much as i enjoy movies of the civil war , i 'd like to return this for a refund alas , that 's a prospect that has , indeed , gone with the wind thumbs down to this one
stick with ted turners gettysburg , what can i honestly say about this work of fluff nothing
first off , i am a huge pixar fan in november in '95 i took my company to see toy story and within 6 months of that showing i got rid of most of the employees that did n't like the film i 've seen every pixar film at least 5o times nuff said
these dvd 's are a joke if you want the original full length movies on dvd go on ebay you will find versions copied from laserdisc they are in widescreen , digital quality , original audio and full length they are superior to the old vhs copies and much better then these new dvd 's
this movie is laughable today it 's very dated , and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so , but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards , it appears like a low budget flick
well , my title says it all there is nothing special or amazing about this movie i do n't like the three main actors , and the ending was just laughable sorry , but it was a stupid movie
you , me and dupree is a formula film , a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth , noisy , crude guy things movies there have been a lot of these films of late \( all spinoffs of the wedding crasher image \) and one wonders if there is a saturation point
here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i could n't believe what i was watching ! moreover , i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on \? is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about \? am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain \? where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema 's most tedious and overrated
this movie is a rehash of the first , but it is a crappy , unconvincing , emotionally uninspiring movie
after seeing the real show in l a , my girlfriend and i were really looking forward to the dvd and after last night 's viewing , i went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that i did n't like the whole thing that much i'm relieved to see that other fans just could n't handle all the audience shots either this dvd tries so hard to define paul 's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know , feel , and live it they tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it if you 're from mars and this is your first day on earth , you might appreciate the way the dvd attempts to explain the relevance of paul 's work if you 've been on this planet for awhile , chances are you 're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music
this really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book , if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out , and i accept that , but to completely change the ending is not excusable what was wrong with the way the book ended \? like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them \( even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world \) if you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy , its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback , if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape

i consider myself a huge pixar fan this is easily the most insipid pixar movie ever pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one i have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie pixar , if you are listening , please , please , dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c grade stuff i expect more from you

the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i wo n't bore you with the list
if you have read \( and enjoyed \) any of the x men , save your , buy the graphic novel of the original dark phoenix saga , and pretend this movie was n't made if you want to see some special effects are n't that hung up on character development , i 'd still just rent it
saw this movie at the actual premier in nyc and met sturla gunnerson and i told him exactly how i felt gerard butler needed a bigger horse i expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater sarah polleys language was uncalled for in the film they could have written better lines the fade in , fade out was like a child filming with a video camera the film was funny at times and mixed with gore like eating sweet and sour being a gerard butler fan i was distressed after watching this film why did he do this \? gerry butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes this unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like the jury , please or the phantom of the opera i expect mr butler to be past these b films and know he does have much better stuff in the works than goodness
the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting how does a man trained as a 'killing machine' integrate back into society yes , it 's been done before but still holds promise the plot was adequate
i am a big fan of kurt russell but this movie sucks and as forrest gump said , thats all i have to say about that
growing up , i absolutely loved the turtles but this dvd stinks the only plus is that i can have the original episodes in convenient dvd form rather than track down a bunch of old vhs tapes this dvd is no different from the season one and season three dvd's they all have spelling errors and title errors and each one seems to have been produce in a half a fashion just to capitalize on the new turtle's sucess which by the way the new turtles are much better than the old ones on the season three dvd the package refers to bebop as bebob , nice editing job i guess it was to hard to get that one right also all three of the dvd's are bare bones with no special features the price does however reflect the crappy job the studio did on this most of these dvd's can be purchased for around 10 bucks i just wish that peter laird had the rights to the old show so that it could have been done some justice on dvd
unfortunatly this dvd set is defective on disc 1 episode 3 the picture just freezes and then loops back to the opening scene i sent one back to amazon then got a replacement and had to send that one back as well so i thought maybe the ones at the store might not be defective so i bought a copy at target and it 's the same problem ! i 've written to anchor bay twice and they have n't bothered to reply this situation really angers me because i love this season but am not going to waste money on a defective product do n't buy this dvd until the problem is resolved ! ! ! !
i got this movie on sale a couple years ago it looked pretty good , but you know how most of that goes i really lke movies like scream , i thought it would be like that , but nope this movie was a hundred percent perdictable i knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie from the first seen you can tell it 's gonna suck spoiler the first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway , when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out the lights flicker \( wow how original \) and a person in a really , really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax this is what happens throughout the entire movie do n't waste your time or money if you really want to see it i would suggest renting it not worth more than 3 00 anytime
i guess i expected more out of this movie but i confess i was mildly disappointed in it at first , the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling still , it was a great cast dean martin was particularly adept at westerns , much more so than frank sinatra , who pretty much plays frank sinatra in this one it is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies , in this case , anita ekberg and ursula andress the bad guys are well represented by victor buono and charles bronson a fun movie but not particularly memorable
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by 9th gate this film is tepid , there is none of the satanic intensity ambiance that you find in 'rosemary 's baby' it 's too hollywood , surprisingly , considering the maverick presence of depp polanski film opens well , with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence , but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 , which i was equally disappointed in , at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it , but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball , considering he was the producer director co screenwriter , and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible , so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film , rent it only buy angel heart instead
ok , basquiat , at age 19 see the actual person period \( so wonderfully played by wright in movie basquiat \) what a major trainwreck of film this is should have stayed where it was buried sorry , wo n't waste my time to list all the many , very many reasons , already wasted my money
i recently discovered this set available on dvd and was very excited , since i 've been a fan of david suchet , agatha christie and hercule poirot for a long time i was really looking forward to viewing these , however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it did n't get better the image quality is actually worse than what i 've seen on aired on television via cable the picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines , which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore i'm amazed acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it i will definitely not buy any other titles by acorn media
the first set was very entertaining a spy crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by moore and curtis set ii is another kettle of fish altogether the second set is strictly played for laughs there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin frankly , i hoped for more
this is a documentary about adhd not half japanese most of the so called critics ca n't remember a dambed thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of jad while continuously ranting about their major label conspiracy theories penn jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homless person out of jad 's material and then threatened jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy if you 're interested in mental illness and sleazy people like penn jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this if you 're interested in a great american rock band then just buy the albums and listen
\( 1 \) scarlett o'hara is the least likable heroine i 've ever seen she has no redeeming qualities
a poorly conceived , poorly put together mess do n't bother
let me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film , make your own decision as to if you will purchase it this is simply my opinion of the film this movie has horrible fight scenes that do n't appear to be martial arts at all basically , van damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities , and forces him into a stiff choreographed position they found some buff guys , okay , big deal they put them in a film , and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills these guys do n't have that vin diesel has far better choreography by himself i have said this about other films and i will say it about this one as well the cast crew benefited from the production of this film , so it doesnt affect them they go home happy believing they did a good job you , the consumer , you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it wrong move as for this film you will waste money that could have been put into your retirement , or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves save that money and put it where it belongs this is not worth your cash
this is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war , geopolitics and weapons trade there is almost no dialogues
i am confused does anyone know who owns this dvd whether this chinese film the road home is in french audio only for this sony dvd \? it 's not in mandarin , cantonese or any other chinese dialect \? the answer will determine whether i buy it or not
maybe i'm spoiled by big budget sci fi films , but i thought this movie kind of stunk it felt and looked like a tv movie and was n't scary , at all the best funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady 's name or face , and everyone described her the same way the one with the glasses oh , her have n't seen her lol
okay , this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans
this is not a collection of the superbowls , played from start to finish , as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe i got this for my father so he could watch the 49ers tromp all over the broncos over and over again \( since they certainly have n't been up to much lately ! \) unfortunately , all we got was a collection of highlights , with so many up close and personal shots , that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen tv an expensive disappointment , surely
dubbed and renamed see the original swordsman ii instead
wuthering heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion , betrayal , madness , despair , greed , hatred , and revenge it 's not necessarily a pleasant read , but always an engrossing one emily bronte 's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you 've finished the book

i'm not sure what everyone else watched , maybe i was expecting to much after reading these other reviews , but i was more than just a little disappointed the women are attractive that is for sure , but that 's the only thing this movie has going for it the sex footage was over before is started at the most they lasted about 30 seconds i'm not looking for hard core porn , but this was far from what i was looking for my suggestion is 'buyer be aware'
20 years ago , there was a terrible accident in the mine on valentine 's day the following year one of the miners , harry warden , takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident since that day , there is no celebration of valentine 's day in the little town valentine 's buff until now \( that is 1981 \) but harry warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration
are you kidding me ! \? this movie is beyond all redemption sean conery is a disgrace to himself , running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on wtf ! what 's with all the naked women in this thing \? why do they have to be naked \? they 're hideous looking in the face and body my god , my eyes ! if this is the product of the love generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating , no wonder our society is crazy i just ca n't get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are , it 's downright insulting to the human brain whoever wrote this and was crazy enough to finance it , should be killed and then studied so we do n't have another idiot of this caliber spawned
this is the worst version of 'wuthering heights' i have ever seen please , if you are a fan of emily bronte 's classic , do n't waste your time on this movie i do n't know how anyone could try out for a part in a movie without reading the book it was based off of first \( none of the actors read the novel \) instead , try seeing the 1939 or 1992 version , they are worth your time and money
i first saw the movie poster and was n't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler but then i heard composer alan menken \( who had worked on beauty the beast and aladdin \) was attached and this made me rethink my position then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before still , i went into the movie theater ready to give home on the range a chance
i'm a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily too heavily on her charm and unfortunately , it is some of her worst acting work , posey , sing song , and superficial now , if you 've read her bio , and know what was going on with her and holden , that could explain it , but still , this film is very static
actually not going to be kind what a load of rubbish
i have four kids , boys and girls , ages 3 to 8 we all love hot wheels , world race we previewed the first acceleracer movie , and were very disappointed ! i agree that perhaps it is targeted to some older kids , but that leaves a void for the younger ones why do the characters have huge , unnatural feet and arms \( not to mention lani 's breast augmentation \) \? lani now looks like a streetwalker , taro \( my favorite \) like a cheap hood , and what happened to marky \? the themes have turned dark , the behavior \( street racing , violence , nastiness \) provides an incredibly poor example a movie that was very safe and innocuous has turned into a minefield for my children i disagree with some reviewers that the kids do n't pay attention to those parts we will not let our kids watch this trash ! my kids and their parents are mystified at why such a good thing was allowed to go so far down we told them it is rated pg \( i agree with that reviewer \) and they might watch it when they are older parents beware do not trust materials marked for children to necessarily be appropriate
funniest movie i 've ever watched i think i busted a rib laughing
i returned this as i found out it was either letterbox or wide screen format , i only buy or want tapes or dvds that fill the entire tv screen , otherwise i dont buy the
making it no reason to even consider getting this filler filled p o s
i was told this was hilarious cheech and chong and so many others not only were theye barely there , i must have missed the funny part i wish i 'd missed the whole movie do n't bother
i am a bbc devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic bbc storytelling and visual feasting however , i was only partially correct it is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly i left the film feeling robbed , disappointed , sad , and a bit unfulfilled i viewed it only once and then sold it on e bay at a cut rate price
what a disappointment ! every time it gets hot , it cuts straight to the end the movie is entirely foreplay ! !
while i have not purchased this box set i have seen many of the episiodes several times as i am a fan of spongebob allthough he and patrick can be a bit pathetic at times for example , in the idiot box when they order a tv just to play in the box anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out just one bit of the episiode just one bite which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor you all know it so there 's no need for explanation i think it 's so pathetic that certain scene 's in cartoons have to be snipped out
this film was not what i expected it was so plain i was about ready to turn it off
i bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through some chapters , i watch several more times
do n't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like i did the earlier artisan release is still much better than this special edition the image is better and also the sound i do n't know what lions gate thought they were doing , but remastered \? no i compared both several times before writing this even though i only had to compare once might as well wait for a hd dvd to come out , this is a waste unless you want the additional features
an average customer review of almost 4 stars \? have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia \? jason supposedly went to hell yeah \? then why is still in one piece this time round , the government realise there 's nothing they can do to stop jason and have him captured he is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm unfortunatley , he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space ! yes space ! the budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good there may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it 's just not enough ! this sequel sounds more like a star trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good friday the 13th flick supposedly , a twelfth friday the 13th movie is being made \( if you count the excellent freddy vs jason \) while freddy vs jason was indeed impressive , there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore
i am a recovering alcoholic with 19 years of continuous sobriety
the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love
i own over 250 dvds , with a huge mixture of types this is the worst movie for this year i 've seen so far what a waste of my time go ahead and see it , but i do n't recommend it
let me break it down for you in a nutshell , people it 's a murder mystery in which the film 's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is but , she has her doubts but she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy 's arm he has the same thing but what does she do \? she has sex with him sex , sex , and more sex if you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him \? plus , 50 of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk i do n't think this was a perfectly planned movie , to tell you the truth
alright take a step back , and tell me there is n't something decidedly wrong , even militantly spooky , about the american southwest
so i thought i only saw pieces of the abc presentation of desperation on tv i thought i missed the chapter about the first family , david 's family , and how they came to be in the town jail it turns out i did n't miss anything , that 's the way it was filmed when i heard the film was available on dvd and r rated , too , i vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen curses , gore , adult scares and , perhaps a booby ! one would n't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on abc but the r rated version , oh boy !
this review might contain some spoilers i was disappointed with this anime after all the reviews i read i was expecting alot more it was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over there was some humor but all in all i would not waste money on it infact , i took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after i purchased it
boring , boring , boring what a let down ! it 's dated and just not good it was torture sitting through this
the voice over sounds like the guy from the hoky motivational videos everyone had to watch in high school this is an overly sentimental piece of sh t some , and only some , of the visuals are really incredible \( the tow in scenes \) the rest is a feel good , surfers are awesome waste of time i love to surf for my own reasons it 's not because i need to feel like a part of a big community for authentic , thought provoking surf films , check out thicker than water , brokedown melody and september sessions save step into liquid for the people who fall all over themselves for the next predictable hollywood offering
we bought several different potty training videos and this was , unexpectedly , the worst the reason it lacks focus it comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids , or at least do n't remember what potty training is all about
this experience was totally unsatisfactory ! ! ! i received a notice that the product had been shipped it included a very long number to trace the shipment it was promised for february 6th , but did not arrive on february 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made now which is it \? did you have it , and misplace it in the process , or did you lie when you said it was already send out \? i have had otherwise good results in my purchases from amazon , but this is a real mess up i wrote to ask how to reorder , and this is the only response since then is there anything you can do to change this problem \? do you reprint reviews of your service
sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west sure there were some noble men and victimized young chinese girls , but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie i do not find very graphic violence , nudity , and rape on the top of my must watch list i skipped to the ending on the second disk
one of the worst films of a generation many talented comedic \( dave thomas colleen camp \) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral
who in the hell gave this movie the green light \? god awful performances and such immature jokes that only a child can laugh at this may perhaps be the worst movie ever created and i'm the kind of person that appreciates anything but this this is just pure , 100 crap this will most likely be the only time i will ever say i want my two hours back and mean it
peter sellers as well as peter o'toole and all the beautiful women capucine , romy schneider , etc , make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60 's was really that world that mad \? of course ! you could n't stand life without a psychonalist thus , the film reflects precisey that the lack of self confidence , the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade , till happy ending , of course o'toole and schneider get married and lived happily everafter and everybody has surpassed their personal crises good for the movie the humour is just wonderful i recommend it most enthusiasticall
the year 1965 the cast peter sellers peter o'toole woody allen ursula andress the soundtrack burt bacharach tom jones dionne warwick manfred mann the movie believe it or not terrible really as in unwatchable \( other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits \) painfully unfunny slapstick routines , actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards , and no plot to speak of not even fun to watch for 60 's camp value like the party or casino royale i had to turn it off at about the halfway mark
i am a big fan of woody allen and i presume that i will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies prior to viewing what 's new pussycat \? , i would have presumed that i would enjoy each and every movie however , what 's new pussycat \? has shown me that even woody allen can make a disaster movie
i am still awaiting receiving dora the explorer meets diego i have ordered it twice once before christmas and kept updating my order to ship when received and then i ordered it later and canceled the original order because it looked like it was available and then i got a delay again if you have any update on when this will be in and shipped i would really like to know everything else that i have odered and has come from toys r us through amazon i have been very pleaase with
throughly dismisses all jazz after 1960 , including fusion , free jazz , and everything thereafter marsalis actually calls cecil taylor 's music self indulgent bullsh apparently taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film how was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual \( but more likely agenda driven \) on pbs , i will never understand if you think swing is the only valid form of jazz , you will love this series if you think coltrane is a god , you get five minutes' summary so lets see here 15 hours on louis armstrong and duke , 5 minutes on coletrane , and a total didmissal of everything after duke 's death reminds me of the republisuck 's fair and balanced nonsense pbs , this is your wake up call stop trying to rewrite history jazz ai n't in a museum just ask the artists \( most of whom are alive \) whom burns left out metheny , you out there
i had to watch it in my 8th grade pe class and it is very informative and somewhat graphic it shows the scariness of it and makes you eat for one thing ! you wont ever forget it
do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance it is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come the writing is atrocious , and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue , they are completely unbelievable the story is utterly predictable , though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots , and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel it does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency , with terrible editing , pathetic sound , and blatant continuity problems take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile the bbc has made many better mini series , and pretty much any one of them would be preferable
next to a night at the roxbury \( another will ferrell zero \) this is the worst movie i 've ever seen so maudlin and it dragged on and on and on it could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so i guess it has some authenticity brad pitt 's particularly bad one facial expression \( blank \) and a painful monotone delivery i think he got some award aptly represented by a carved wooden statue of keanu reeves mr brangelina jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like anthony hopkins bottom line this movie stinks and so \( ironically \) does pitt
metropolis , fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece , is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one ! but over the years , this film has been reedited , recut , and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker since its stay on the public domain shelf , the prints and image quality have over the years been poor i do not recommend the following versions 1 the goodtimes video release has poor image quality and even worse , no musical score ! 2 the now notorious madacy dvd , which is about 5 times as worse as the goodtimes video release , contains horrible , blurry image quality , freeze frame opening titles , and an annoying musical score ! just recently , tcm \( turner classic movies \) has broadcast the brand new , beautifully restored 2002 restoration of metropolis which i taped off of and trust me , it 's well worth it ! buy the kino restored version on either vhs or dvd , but do not buy the horrible public domain versions which can definitely rip you off ! a terrific film and thanks to kino for making this restored version a definite must see ! i also recommend the 1984 rerelease by giorgio moroder \( which is now unfortunately out of print \) and buy the soundtrack to go with it
can someone please tell me where to get the re mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles \? the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio , or english audio , but no english subtitles !
if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews , you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good \( not great \) acting jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent well not all of the time , since her accent seems to come and go the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has skip it unless you really , really , really love jessica lange
this video is boring too much talking and too little talking from the muppet characters might be suited more for an older child but mine is 13 months so there has to be constant colorful characters for her to be interested
of course the criterion collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer the problem is the film itself
i love stargate , and give the movie 5 stars i own a vhs copy , and have watched it many times
this movie was so stupid , everyone listens to nina when she is clearly messing with their lives they are stupid enough to believe her , and well i do n't even know what else happens cause i saved myself and changed the channel
what a disappointing purchase this was ! i have never purchased a dvd set that was this bad in quality without it being pirated actually , i 've seen vhs copies with better audio video quality if i had not purchased the set from amazon itself i would have thought , i did get a cheap bootleg the sound is a bit flat , which i could deal get over , but the picture quality is just horrendous ! all of the episodes are grainy , pixilated , and some even blur a bit there are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on it 's a waste of money to buy dvd 's like this shame on fox for releasing them this bad !
his girl friday is an ok movie about newspaper reporters in the early part of the 20th century i think it was supposed to be funny , and it may have been at the time , but most of the dialog was lost on me
the simple truth is , this movie is boring yes , it has a really long \( not to say interminable \) rape scene in it , and yes , some guy gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher but so what \? it 's still boring we just sort of drift around from moment to moment , through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes , backwards through the story , which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact then it 's over and you get to do something more interesting , like shine the silverware do n't get me wrong , i like dark and disturbing films \( texas chainsaw massacre , anyone \? \) , but i prefer them to at least be interesting and involving i 'd take anything david cronenberg ever made over this , and i'm including the early stuff
warning spoilers opening scene is quite shocking some graphic effects there is more male nudity and male genitalia than female there is only one quick very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning , or end of the movie since the movie begins with the ending scene and ends with the opening scene the rape scene is violent , with graphic language obviously actual penetration is achieved \( anal \) but none shown not even a good boob shot you of course see the male genitalia \( big deal \) !
pass on this one the original was ok , but if you want great music , great dancing , awesome sets , truly celtic even with the huge ego of michael flatley , who is , by the way an extraordinary talent , buy his show feet of flames totally toe tapping awesome this will be no disappointment like the so called best of riverdance it has no spanish dance , no spirituals , no hip hop , no russian dance all well and good for many but feet of flames is totally irish celtic , whichever you want to call it emma killingbeck scots irish to the cor
peter segal 's anger management is a film with nothing going for it it is best described as boring , annoying , and devoid of laughs
i really hate how all these exercise videos are repackaged and called something different it 's damn confusing
in the annals of criterion this has to be one of their most bloated , pointless offerings this film is just ridiculously bad , not fun , just kind of depressing to see so much wasted effort on such a pathetic script if you really want to watch 1960s willis o'brien inspired stop motion animation watch anything by harryhausen and call it good equinox works only as a curiosity or mystery scince theater 3000 fodder
i like air supply songs this dvd is a big disappointment sound quality could have been better
movie has a lot of cursing , and nudity as well i was very disappointed because i thought the reviews made it sound like i could show it to high school students
robert groden suggests that the zapruder film of the kennedy assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of kennedy in my opinion , his evidence is shaky at best groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who really shot kennedy , and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by abc , cbs , and many books groden needs to finally realize that the kennedy assassination has been solved definitively , and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash cow alive
this is not about riverdance
please do not waste your time or money on this much hyped piece of trash not only is harvey walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant , he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video unlike other excercise gurus , he does not exercise with you , instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands the production quality is very low budget it looks like it was shot using a camcorder the set is bland and melancholy , and there is no music ! all you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers , who display no enthusiasm at all and , i for one , ca n't blame them i only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them i was never more bored in my life walden 's cuing is off , and furthermore , it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you that 's just crazy what was he thinking \? i have no words to describe how awful this video is i wish i could give it 0 stars do n't waste your money please ! ! ! ! the other reviewers must be new to exercise because i ca n't understand how they could n't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect if you want a high powered , energizing , effective calorie burning workout you will not like this video at all you will be sorely disappointed for sure instead try kathy smith 's peak fat burning or any one of her step workouts
the only thing worse than seeing this movie is the fact that it plays automatically all over again when it 's over this is a glorified music video of horrible music jim carey should not be on the cover of this movie either , as he is in about 15 to 20 of the whole thing they should have had whoever the musical artist was i honestly do n't even know the plot of this movie , and i'm not kidding i laughed so hard out loud when i had to read the back of the dvd case to remember what it was supposed to be about the sound \? they interlaced two songs \( one in your right speaker , one in your left \) that do n't even match if you want an idea for a good movie , read the back of this dvd case , and follow that plot , as the director sure steered clear of it alan thicke i thought i knew ye ! oh , and i gave it one star only because i could n't find the give me my money back option
the acting was stiff and vapid , the filming was grainy and amateurish , the story was non existent a good rx for insomnia , this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality seeing young jim carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role
poor lindsay lohan it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life , she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off as an actress , she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft as a child actress , she was a natural fit for her spate of disney appearances , with freaky friday her crowning achievment however , as a young adult , the pressure is much higher , as is the bar of success and movies like this are not helping
i liked this movie but i also did n't like it
every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor actress in it that everything will turn out good blue steel is one of those movies jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties \( or should i say murders \) which she did not commit sounds like an interesting plot , right \? it would be had the script not been so poorly written the supporting actors give such a bland typical performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue aside from the acting , the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop \( jamie lee \) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her so why do i give blue steel an extra star \? well , i 'll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television just do n't pay over 3 to rent it and certainly do n't buy it
this is just like an updated b movie from the sixties and i enjoyed it it 's real comic book stuff the effects are not bad , the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it 's easy viewing i enjoyed this more than big budget films such as evolution or jurassic park 3 but i think the absence of big names will put people off , not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job and if big names do n't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this
i love adam sandler well , i used to love him , before he made eight crazy nights not only was this cartoon not funny , it was downright trash i would not recommend this feature to anyone eight crazy nights was short on story , long on time , and wearing on patience i kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself i needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that i will never get back needless to say , i stuck it out until the credits , and now i have to live with the facts that i 1 \) watched the movie and 2 \) i 'll never get that time back so now i sit here , typing away a review i doubt anyone will read , wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie ! humbug ! watch ishtar , you 'll get more out of it oh , and i only awarded one star because amazon insists you give everything at least one star i did this under protest
death tunnel began with promise early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals , wonderful music , and a good feel them the actors opened their mouths and death tunnel fell apart
to enjoy citizen kane , you have to be able to answer the question above i just hate almost everything about this film i think it 's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep many people will fall for it but it 's very hard to make a truly great film !
this is not a movie , in a classic sense this is a set of interviews of dj 's amp promoters i'm fine with that however the djs that participates are not the best representations of the electronic industry where is paul oakenfold , paul van dyk , sasha , digweed , dave seaman , deep dish , dj dan and countless other famous dj 's \? i understand that the budget might have been too small to invite one of those dj 's mentioned above for an interview or so but in this movie there are lots of dj 's that are not that well representative of an industry that 's becomming smaller and smaller for your money 's worth , buy a breakbeat dance video where you will be more entretained than a documental wanna be
first off , let me say that this is a great collection of really bad sci fi movies the selection spans several sub genres of the classic sci fi age you 've got gamera movies , hercules movies , outer space movies the whole gamut
bearing in mind that the 50 movie pack line is what it is , no frills packages of public domain films , i have to say that sci fi classics is not up to the level of mystery classics and horror classics , which i also own i 've watched everything in the mystery and horror sets , and , while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former , i did n't feel cheated by either moreover , some of the films included , such as detour , impact , bluebeard , and too late for tears , actually are classics of a sort , deserving of repeated viewings
kiefer sutherland stars in `dead heat' a crime drama in which the star of hit tv series `24' can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with he plays pally , 35 year old boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem , and his acting is very good overall , however , there is not much that i can recommend in `dead heat' except some nice touch in showing the characters the film tries to include as many things as possible , but few of them really materialize
delmer daves' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film the robe starring richard burton a totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay , direction , acting , or historical accuracy of any sort avoid at all costs unless you 're expecting to see it as a comedy
yeeouch ! think i spit on your grave with a very good art director audition for the lolita set if you feel kevin bacon got off too easy in the woodsman , or you enjoy sitting through entire law and order svu marathons on tnt , this film has something for you everyone else be advised to stay far , far away
why is this movie a classic \? the plot line was nonexistent , and the characters were completely unlikeable the implication that annie hall was a lesbian did n't make any sense ! woody allen 's character was completely freeky and there was not a single purpose for him being there come to think of it , there was no purpose for this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! so save yourself and never watch this film
over done is the best way to describe this over the top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a stolen video camera
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate , middle aged strangers \( with all their flaws abundantly clear \) meeting once a week for no strings attached encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore
believe dooby 's one \( zero \) star review not even worth a free rental not worth your precious time you have been warned
i bought this dvd based on the review of it on the dvd drive in web site either the person who reviewed it has never seen an exploitation movie before , or was not old enough to view one in the first place he made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever you would have thought it compared to the 'ilsa' movies the way this guy went on about it i'm not sure what movie he saw , but it was n't this one when the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western , you have to wonder why exactly it merited an unrated version
ernest borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie ! the actors should be embarrassed ! i could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary i ca n't believe i paid 9 99 for this dvd what a fool i was learn from my mistake
the reason the original iron chef was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting therefore , without these elements , it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program
do not confuse this with the real thing i found teh vhs of this for 1 at a store near me i was interested so i got it i watch iron chef on the food network evey night , and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it ! the one commentator is a failed comedian , and the other is a culinary half wit ! i never heard more ussless facts in a 90min span b4 in my life the chefs in the first baattle were , for lack of a better term dissrespectful , i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it during a cooking battle \? ! \? they kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs the cooks were pretty good , they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show there flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing , asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer they kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor out side of star trek or wat ever he was on the only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol all in all i give this 2 stars , and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs , not to the shows them selfs unless your a shatner fanatic , or sone won thats just kinnda like its cooking , i 'll watch it but be warned its not as good as it could be glad i only spen 1 on it bc its truely not worth more
