mccarthy 's writing and portrayal of lester ballard , a necrophiliac , is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape and then you have to wonder why am i siding with a necrophiliac of all people \? the writing is up to the high standards expected of mccarthy , and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche the book has an interesting twist to the plot ballard is falsely accused of rape , his house is auctioned off and he 's left as a social outcast , an animal he is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal if you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read
do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick \? if so , look no further , this book is for you
i was initiated into the world of cormac mccarthy with this novel in southern lit class my professor was the vice president of the cormac mccarthy appreciation society and considers mccarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century , as do i this work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of faulkner it incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter , but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point there is a message about decay , especially of the south in the diction , especially where the flood and the degeneration of lester ballard are concerned there is old south v new south and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of ballard there is also lust here , something that faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than mccarthy in the sound and the fury and as i lay dying however , mccarthy 's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor mccarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution , as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about the ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator , performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well , is the most unique of gifts this novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart , but it is well worth the read it is haunting to the reader , not for its perverse subject matter , but for its understated messages , masterfully placed in the character of lester ballard , a disposessed and depraved madman , holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to
i cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though i can say i enjoyed it in fact , i could n't put it down until i finished it however , i think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of sevierville , tennessee ! strangely , the author refers accurately to several persons and events that i 've known forever mr wade 's children still live in sevierville , so do the whaley and ogle families the 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the white caps were stopped by a real life clint eastwood of a sevier county sheriff ! the opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than c b mccarter whose trademark saying was we sell the earth c b , my grandfather , has never told me of any run ins with lester ballard , the novels main character ! thank goodness ! as it turns out ballard is a murdering necrophiliac this is where mccarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community
there is no denying the strain of faulkner that runs through mccarthy 's early works like his predecessor , mccarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place \( here , the hills of eastern tennessee \) interact but mccarthy is more fun to read his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind 's eye he does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly \( often ungodly \) forms child of god is best known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful , elegant prose but that is one of the great joys of cormac mccarthy 's early novels they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of beautifully painted landscape and haunting , nightmarish imagery
i have read sevral of mccarthy 's other novels his best ones stretch something to the limit in blood meridian it was violence here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings lester ballard is the ultimate user other people exist for him only to meet his needs , even if they are dead i have never before read a book about necrophilia , and yes , as many of the other reviewers point out , reading this book takes a strong stomach yet mccarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off , which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic totally in spite of myself , i found myself cheering ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away the only thing i can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester yet , i believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book i do n't think the title is meant to be ironic i think we are meant to see that even lester ballard really is a child of god
this is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world lester ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the eastern tennessee countryside he 's accused of rape , imprisoned for a short time , then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man it 's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it 's obvious from the start this man is troubled this is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness i found the chapter where the town sheriff , deputy and old mr wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting a recommended book , but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs
if you 're considering buying the peter smith edition of this book , note that it is not a new edition in hardcover but the vintage international edition rebound in red cloth , with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front it looks like it 's been rebound for libraries , is the type of thing that 's usually not for sale to the general public \( \) the book is well rebound , and may still be worth it to you cormac mccarthy diehards out there it is for me , and ultimately i'm just gonna keep the copy of it i bought , but it 's still quite disappointing thought you deserved a warning , hope it came in time mccarthy 's a great writer , of course feel a little guilty about the one star , but it 's an issue of the edition , not the book
what i did n't realise when i ordered this is that it is an publication of a us kennel association it is a slim book , gives a good , realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective , and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like is the kennel business for me \? and what are the main issues in kennel management \? its orientation is toward large kennels \( 65 dogs \) in the us for someone like me , who is thinking about a small kennel in australia , it was interesting , but not really worth its pricetag
ha ha ha hah ha hah ! that 's stirling laughing all the way to the bank or at least i hope that 's what he is doing but sadly i suspect he more likely feels his wiccan sca dnd infused vision of a post apocalyptic society is a reasonable , nay , likely path we 'll follow should selective physical laws break down quick ! stop me ! i feel the need to wave my sword , sing a gaelic song , and break out my cauldron ! the genre requires we make a leap of faith and as a fan of the genre , i do so willingly but having made the leap , it is annoying at best to be forced through this tolkein as faith drivel but as i will likely read the entire series \( remember , i love the genre \) i have to hope that stirling leans towards the thanks for the buck buddy and is himself laughing at us all but a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense !
the protector 's war \( 2005 \) is the second alternate history novel in the change series , following dies the fire in the previous volume , the bearkillers allied with the mackenzie clan , cora central oregon ranchers' association and the university committee they cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along highway 20 at the echo creek bridge , using larson 's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang gliders
i loved stirling 's islands in the sea of time trilogy , and i also loved the first book in this series stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business , in my mind head and shoulders above turtledove and flint in his prose and his execution , but this book is one of the first books i 've ever read in which almost nothing happens at all it is not true to your reader to use an entire book , which runs seven dollars for a paperback , to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters this book is a major disappointment also , i found myself wincing , even in the first book , at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters it comes across as simply ludicrous the best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from britain of the tangential british characters this is a very poor effort and though i plan to read book three even though i hated book two , i think a person , by reading the reviews of book two on amazon , could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing
it completely sucked very long with nothing to say author was proud of his own knowledge of the sca and wiccans , and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development what 's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters
i found that everytime i started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory for instance the family that was running from the baron and his men , it started out fine and then of course the rest of the wiccan army shows up and it ends some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away no one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended i was like what just happened ! it misses the small points that make a world believable , most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them there was no humanity in the scene \( which i thought it was going to show \) just a chance for the wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs very bad stuff there in my opinion i like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense
yet another fine effort from stirling the finely developed plot , the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible , and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again a proven master of the genre , his characters continue to be excellent deep and detailed the plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks , but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels
mr stirling has succeded again protector 's war is an amazing addition to the change trilogy , and well worth the read honestly , i do n't know where to start when explaining how good it is , so i will let you know the one thing i found highly disappointing about it , in one word
while i enjoyed most of dies the fire , by the end i was very annoyed with the juniper character , and found myself skipping over the \( boring \) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook i had hopes for the protectors war , and unfortunately it 's worse than it 's predecessor mckenzie and her group get far too much play , and come across as self righteous religious fanatics the reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems , as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle i found myself skipping large chunks of this book , and the editing switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream did n't help matters any there is too much exposition , and not enough action all in all , a boring disapointment the third book in the series is out in hardcover , but i wo n't even be checking it out of the library
read this book ! i never thought a history book would be one i could not put down it 's enlightening and eye opening it 's a broad , fascinating history
many reviewers have commented that taylor 's american colonies gives indigenous peoples a larger role in north american history than most previous studies do this perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the american revolution
the reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book it makes for hard going , however , the insights into the true american history are many the threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools yet the main disappointment , other than the fact many have complained about \( ie the death of kamehameha \) , is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book , which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway , roxie yonkey , also noted this is one of those times when i wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend
has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well written text by a good historian that is , unless your car wo n't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following monday two days before christmas in that scenario , his good historian ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts taylor not all of us come from big money ! sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so ! thanks for ruining my gpa !
i found this book well researched and full of information i knew nothing about taylor does n't pull any punches when discussing our european ancestors and their brutality towards the native americans they helped destroy fascinating reading for anyone interested in our early history
we all learned the basics of colonial history in school the mayflower jamestown tobacco the development of new amsterdam , boston , charleston , philadelphia indentured servants and french trappers spanish conquistadores however , most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760 moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and indians
traditionally , coverage of colonial america is confined to the study of the thirteen english colonies of the eastern seaboard a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of european involvement in north america , to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before christopher columbus 's historic voyage alan taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book , a wide ranging survey of the first three centuries of the european presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants
books like this are regrettably but understandably rare alan taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in north america up to the turn of the nineteenth century from the earliest migrations across beringia , to the european impact on hawaii it is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single , compact volume while somewhat slanted toward an anglo centric account after the sixteenth century \( for instance , the chapter on the west indies from 1600 1700 is almost entirely about the british presence hispaniola and cuba are completely ignored \) , it is only a moderate bias , admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the french in canada and louisiana , the spanish in the southwest and california , and russians in the northwest and alaska the tone of the writing , however , is exquisitely balanced and clean in fact , the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read , and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era american historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research , critical analysis and sound yet astonishing interpretation taylor 's bibliography is a treasure chest of books i ca n't wait to read he expertly weaves the most recent foci of american historiography atlantic studies , epidemiology , environmental history , pre columbian \( and post columbian \) archaeology , analyses of trade , demographics , gender roles , race , etc into the more familiar stories of explorers , empires , wars and migration the whole story \( or galaxy of stories \) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context perfect for the beginning pupil , this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well read student of american history it is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done
taylor provides an extensive 526 pages including bibliography and index overview of european colonial initiatives in the atlantic , north america and parts of the caribbean from the early 1400s when portuguese and spanish proto colonists got their feet wet , so to speak , by colonizing the azores , canaries and medeiras through spanish and russian efforts on the west coast in the early 1800s substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the french , dutch , and spanish as well as english settlement in the eastern caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the united states
the above is my favorite book and slb conjured up similar emotions in me i read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter 's must read pile when she is ready for it this is one of those books that , when you read it , it forever changes your life atleast it did for me the same way tkam changed me and has stayed with me i highly recommend this book
the story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy
i read this book 2 years ago , and i must say that it is one of my favorite books the imagry that kidd uses is amazing i could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia you fall right in love with the charicters this book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged , and in love it is such a dynamic story with suspense i felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book , and i wish there were a sequal i would reccomend this book to anyone
a wonderful , gentle , informative coming of age story and the reader was a pleasure to listen to
this book really great i enjoyed the story immensley character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized i really could picture myself at the flamingo pink house in tiburon the main character , lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across , but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother the group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life , love , faith and understanding it 's very heartfelt
one of the best books ever ! ! ! ! i was disappointed that the story was n't longer , as i was so sorry when it was over i even contemplated rereading it immediately , but decided to try another sue monk kidd novel instead , and read the mermaid chair different genre , but also very entertaining ! i have become an overnight , true fan of this author
lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south her mother was shot \( unclear by who , but lilly feels responsible \) in infancy , and she has been raised by her mean , hateful father , who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits \( among other tortures \) lilly 's only friend is the african american housekeeper babysitter , rosaleen
the era and the setting of the novel was something i could relate to growing up in the 60 's and 70 's and knew it was a tumultuous time the book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the south during the civil rights era it was wonderfully told and beautifully written
over the years i have read many books on the red scare in hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism this book does the best job of describing the issues , the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films in reading many past books , the authors never quite expressed why they were communists in fact , many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party this book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than dalton trumbo , one of the leading communists in hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist and in the end , he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings
while george clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his community are proudly out of touch with mainstream america , i was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by ronald and allis radosh for readers with an interest in the context of the culture clash between the hollywood elite and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and dvds , this book is an excellent resource
remember the hollywood blacklist \? the hollywood ten \? i 'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you were n't alive in the 1950s that 's because tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive it was the era of the red scare , of senator joseph mccarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in west virginia it was the time of congressional investigations , a time when invoking the fifth amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye for a select few the mccarthy era was a time of great fear , and no one feared this witch hunt against communism more than hollywood why \? because , despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years , the movie industry oozed communists there were so many reds in hollywood that they should have renamed the town little moscow yet even today , you wo n't hear about this truth in the media you will , however , get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of ronald radosh 's red star over hollywood the film colony 's long romance with the left
i have always been curious about the influence of communism in hollywood this book by the radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it it was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated it seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation i came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful the studio heads , whether for economic or patriotic reasons , insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions like c coffman who wrote the prior review , i wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the soviet union it was difficult for me to comprehend how the hollywood writers continued to support the soviet union in the face of clear evidence that soviet movie writers were being executed in the soviet union nor could i fully understand how these hollywood writers , men \( mostly \) of immense talent , cowered before their communist censors finally , the radoshes put the hollywood ten and the blacklist years in perspective they state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the congressional investigations were highly exaggerated i came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost it would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a communist take over of the usa come true since like their fellow professionals in the soviet union they would have probably been executed who said you ca n't win for losing !
this book touches on one of the touchiest and nerve wracked controversies of the last sixty years precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of semi myths one needs to zero in from two angles here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda but despite an obvious bias built in to the account , the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know , but might not , after the shouting matches over mccarthyism i really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction , but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business , but you can read around the lurid conservative passages \( not so bad \) for some useful corrections of the record , and no doubt much left out
it 's no secret that many of hollywood 's and the entertainment businesss 's current stars are socialist afficienados \( or worse \) , but where did this denationalized elitism come from \? red star over hollywood does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the hollywood political left , communists and fellow travelers from the 1930 's to 1950 's with about 37 pages of reference material \( diaries , speeches , congressional testimony , biographies , autobiographies , news articles , interviews , etc \) , the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the soviet union in its attempts to take over hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a soviet america the names of the actors , screen writers , producers etc who were card carrying communists , fellow travelers , quislings , leftists , and varieties of socialists who made up the hollywood scene in those days will floor you you 'll have to read the book to find out who they were and there were many heroes as well , who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs you 'll never watch movies on the turner classic movies channel the same way again after you read the book , look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films
i used to wonder why hollywood ignored the crimes of soviet communism , which easily rival the crimes of national socialism , something they 've shown us over and over and over again \( certainly understandable \) not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during lenin 's red terror , the deaths of millions during forced collectivization , the torture and mass murder during stalin 's purges of the late 30 's , the cold blooded massacre of thousands of polish citizens at katyn , or the horrors of the gulag but hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on mccarthyism and the ghastly blacklist they 're listed in this book guilty by suspicion , the front , the way we were , the majestic , marathon man , the house on carroll street , fellow traveler , one of hollywood ten this is all propaganda of course the way they tell it you 'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history mccarthy and his ilk were no saints , and there were certainly excesses , but i do n't believe anyone was murdered by mccarthy and huac by contrast tens of millions were murdered in soviet russia apparently that 's no big deal to the fools in tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over mccarthyism , the blacklist and the persecuted hollywood ten these crybabies would n't have lasted one day in the kolyma forced labor camps !
the mccarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in american history , and those who faced blacklisting in hollywood have been lauded as heroes through ground breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials , the radoshes have compiled a thorough re examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the communist party , and their betrayal by that very same party
the back lash continues against the media strangle hold on revisionist history

because i do n't get tv one and have only seen the show a few times , i was pleasantly suprised when i saw this cookbook today in the store i recommend it a million times over instead of mo'nique 's , especially since she got some of her recipes from him ! ! !
my husband and i have been waiting for this book since we first saw g garvin on tvone needless to say , i am pleased with this book the layout and directions are clear and concise the entire book is not in color , but i can deal with that here 's the table of contents
excellent book the recipes i have tried are excellent i like pictures too but content and recipe outcome are more important to me i would highly recommend this as a new purchase
i am a big fan of n sparks and enjoyed this book as i do all of his books
sparks continues to make his readers feel i hope he continues to write for a long time
i use the notebook and a walk to remember as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses , i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer , i was more satisfied with the rescue taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl , etc , etc ,
i absolutely love all of nicholas sparks' books i have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you get your kleenex 's ready you ca n't go wrong here
i 've been adventuring off reading new writers that i 've been hearing about well sparks was one of them and after reading this i wonder why did it take me so long to read his books this book was really heart touching the mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his the love story was also great because that is somewhat reality when you loose someone or go threw hard times its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own i ca n't wait to read more of sparks books because i 've already heard so many great things about them
i just got done reading the rescue last night i just did n't like the part when taylor blamed himself for his father 's death he had a right to be happy and live his life the boy really likes taylor denise was a sweet lady i am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a dad you might want to read that book again i am a nicholas sparks fan i have been his fan for 1 year and a month i love all his stories , i will be looking forard to the next one in october
i have read several of nicholas sparks' books , but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story , but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way mr sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from mr sparks like the notebook or the wedding if you want a good romantic read
i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway , it was disappointing , really the book was slow , and it was too long for a story of its type i mean , i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it , i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow , but taylor 's self conflict was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me , go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked
the above is my favorite book and slb conjured up similar emotions in me i read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter 's must read pile when she is ready for it this is one of those books that , when you read it , it forever changes your life atleast it did for me the same way tkam changed me and has stayed with me i highly recommend this book
the story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy

the messenger by daniel silva is just as interesting , exciting , and intriguing as every other gabriel allon book
well , imho , not as great as the other books in the allon series , but well worth the read !
very pleased with the price and speedy delievery and quality of the product
in this novel we have the characters we have come to love the writing is tighter and the plot clear not quite as exciting or fresh some further development with leah happens which i wo n't reveal
a caveat to all westerners who may think our most sacrosanct values are protected silva reaches into inner space to warn us of the dedicated nature of the enemy if this is fiction , it is well dressed as a wake up call to its readers
i'am unable to get this message to anyone this is the second book i orderd and both books are bad this one starting on disc 4 all is bad

i think this is a brilliant book a great selection of interesting and relevant ideas on art , politics and technology beautiful images too and well published
i read bruner 's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education however , journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to bruner 's overly dense prose
this is , by far , the worst book i have ever been forced to read one star is too much the title of this book , the culture of education leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education he toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does , but would n't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way \? this book is entirely unreadable for example , here is a sentence from page 106 many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible , even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection what exactly does this mean \? i 'll tell you what i think this book is i think that mr bruner is trying to impress people , while trying to make them feel stupid if he has something to say , he should just say it ! he buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as immutable , pontogenetically , and hermeneutic if you are buying this book on amazon , i suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell
this book is a gift for readers maybe not all readers , but those who are genuinely interested in human values and culture bruners ideas are bright and deep , making us understand that the future of education depends on human beings as agents of their destiny the importance of every cultures history and the transmission of experiences is only possible through human interactions we cannot be naive and think that technology is not an instrument of culture it is , and we must acknowledge it , otherwise we will be overridden by it but , education is only possible by means of intersubjective exchanges they are the key to the development of human beings
i do n't know about you , but sometimes i stumble upon a book that is a salve to my soul i am not happy about one thing or another , and i need someone to talk to , talk at , or listen to i need to look into someone else 's life so that i can feel human again and not totally strange and alone
every year or so i re read heartburn , one of my favorite novels of all time it is fall on the floor funny , and possibly the best and most memorable form of revenge that a spurned wife ever had
if i had it to do over again , i would have made a different kind of pie the pie i threw at mark made a terrific mess , but a blueberry pie would have been even better , since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer so rachel samstat muses on her marriage to mark feldman
this book took a little getting used to \( this was my first of reading books with recipes within the storylines \) , but once i did boy did i laugh ! great story along with recipes who could n't beat a book that was funny , witty , and full of recipes ! ! a great read for anyone whom wants to curl up with a good book
i did n't like this book truth be told , i still have n't finished it , and i bought it over six months ago the characters are boring the situation \( while ripe with potential \) drags and the recipes do n't even sound good i am supremely disappointed , as i usually love what nora ephron does bummer
nora crafted one of my all time favorite books why i picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me why i finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery why i 've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat sadness steeped in life 's tea in real life , i 've played the part of the toddler in this tale wish i could say my folks were class acts , such as the author and her former spouse , but chicken fried steak is more common in middle america than lillian hellman 's pot roast laurel82
this is one of contemporary fictions first books it was written in the early eighties before bridget jones became a household name it is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage it is a quick read , but its not an earth shattering premise i recommend it for the beach or the bathtub
now that our democratic system has been eroded almost to the point of no repair , perhaps we should read books like this one to refresh our minds about what this country has always stood for
i am unfortunately not suprised by any of the revelations in this book it seems that the vast majority of americans simply do not care what kind of scumbags claim to represent us unfortunately , i do not own a multibillion dollar corporation , so i suppose i do not deserve representation hey , did n't the declaration of independence say something about people not being represented properly \?
this book is a terrific volume for understanding what 's gone wrong in america over the past 30 years unlike many best selling authors , who spout only uninformed opinions and vitriolic ones at that , this guy actually does substantive research on his issues and helps us understand the deeper context behind them the history , the players , their connections to other folks what good is that you 'll learn how much of our world is being controlled destroyed by people and regulations that you 've never even hear of or about if everyone read this book and spoke up , we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives we 'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this
actually , you ca n't according to greg palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges jeb bush with instituting his own style of jim crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected it 's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that bush would have won anyway palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up but palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote , and the votes that were not counted
i read this book in record time greg palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government' i am ashamed that our own us media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government from iran to iran contra to iraq and the oil fields , from the halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of all the people and how important freedom of the press and the fourth estate is to your democracy
palast bares it all put me through all 5 stages of mourning from disbelief to anger to despair
greg palast loves challenges bold and sarcastic now you can understand why emergent countries will always remain in the third world for the benefit of big corporations and corruptous politicians not surprising that all the info provided by palast was never shown on the america 's news
the first time i read this book it was because i 'd heard an interview with the author on npr and felt compelled to get the whole story it 's a fast , entertaining and scary read do n't skip any parts if you can help it it 's not just about corporate and political corruption , it details \( with evidence \) how this world of ours works and what we need to keep our eyes open for when the bad guys get into our neighborhoods the sections on what us corporations do in other countries is appalling the sections on the country destroying terms of imf and world bank loans is horrifying and , if you 've ever wondered what the heck public utility privatization is all about , this explains it and it's ugly
devour this book in small bites , or you 're likely to choke on the raw truth of it between these covers , palast demonstrates repeatedly why everyone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts while i'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations , the policies and actions carried out by the bush administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of palast 's claims in broad daylight
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent , he had a crappy upbringing , that does not make for a good book
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books , especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items , which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug , self serving and self indulgent , written by a person with little or no empathy , especially for the people he castigates for example , his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the
if you like strange stories , you will love running with scissors because it is just plain weird after reading this book , you will have a feeling that you just returned from the twilight zone
how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book the book was anything but funny i read about half , up to
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius , and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
lula cruz and her best gay friend , jeff , embark on a trip to miami just before college eats her time up after a series of misfortune , they find themselves working for a somewhat latin woman , cece , in a cuban cafe
eighteen year old lula cruz is totally stoked about the road trip she 'll be taking with her best friend , jeff , the summer before she begins her studies at a university in miami she plans on checking out of hot , sweaty nyc , and diving right in to the cool waters that sobe \( south beach \) provides however , the two friends are quickly realizing how hard it truly is to be out on their own , with no one there to support them they get day jobs that totally run them down , and are , how should we put this totally boring ! so lula and jeff decide to spice things up by entering a local band contest that could get them televised and everything the only problem , is that the newest hottie lula 's been hooking up with , enrique , has also entered the band contest , and is her band 's toughest competition sure , enrique is totally mesmerizing to look at , but lula 's not sure if she can trust him with her secrets or her heart
i love all the books in this series \( royally jacked , spin control , ripped at the seams , etc \) , and i could n't wait to read south beach sizzle
then you will absolutely fall in love with this book this book is full of images from a wide range of media and artists the short bios on the artists are short but informative and do n't take up much space \( more room for pictures \) if you 're something of an artist yourself then you can certainly pull lots of ideas from this book i definitely am glad i bought this book
not only the content is insightful , but the design of this book is just wonderful it is a good source of international drawing 's world and a good coffee table book get it now
i am disappointed with the quality of the images they are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all i have returned this book , which is something i do once every 1000 books i order , and it is the first art book i have ever returned in my life
beautifully bound and a pleasure to hold what a book is all about vs the digital stuff
it has many interesting works in the book it is great to have it
this is a book that when you first open it up and flip through a couple of pages you will be saying to yourself that you have to sit down with it for a long considered look myself , i just looked at the care that phaidon press took while publishing this , from its rough artistic pages to the in depth look at contemporary drawing and knew instantly that this was a survey book that i would be opening time and again for years to come
david kennedy 's freedom from fear , the 9th volume of the oxford history of the united states , is a generally exceptionally well researched history covering from the great depression to the end of world war ii in this book , kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians , as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals
freedom from fear is an exhaustive study of america and its people during two of this country 's most defining periods , the great depression and world war ii david kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in american history while the book is geared towards the general reader , it does n't lack for analysis , which makes this both an accessible and very informative book
despite the newfound popularity of social history , and ethnic history , and gender history , it 's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old fashioned survey history of america heavy on political history , freedom from fear tells the story of america during the great depression and the second world war it is a survey , but it is broad and deep , running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years david kennedy 's pulitzer prize winning text is worth every penny
there is much to like in david kennedy 's history of the united states during the 1930s and early 1940s his book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period his examination of the new deal is both insightful and judicious , while his description of america in the second world war is gripping and informative throughout the book kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events , discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the american people and their government
with w bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the new deal , whether you agree with him or not i ca n't think of a better time , and reason for reading this remarkable study by david kennedy
this is a very literate and enjoyable history it explains some of the greatest crises of western civilization and parades in all their glory heroes like fdr , churchill , truman , and marshall , and it singles out others for less glowing treatment
i thoroughly enjoyed this book the book is exactly what it says it is , a general history of the united stated during the depression and wwii i found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote this should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together the book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it after reading it , i can see why it won the pulitzer prize
freedom from fear by david kennedy is a highly respectable history book for the great depression and wwii era professor kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research , as well as his own opinions on the great depression in the beginning of this book , kennedy begins with herbert hoover and how he did things wrong , but then he turned to fdr who kept up with the changing economy at that time kennedy portrays fdr as powerful and willing for change he was an inspiring character for those during the depression further into the book , kennedy devotes his research to the new deal and the effects it had on the depression kennedy did go into detail about the effects , but he should have researched more about the causes of the depression even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader , it was kennedy 's writing style that made the book hard to put down it was very enjoyable to read and we recommend it to any history lovers who want to learn more about the depression

this book is first published in 1999 right in the beginning , drucker defined management as not only business management , but management in all kinds of organization government , university , hospital , army , non profit organization , etc the book is easy to read , just below 200 pages the scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is it describes the certainties collapsing birthrate , shift in performance , global competitiveness , etc , and of course , how it affects all kinds of organizations it talks about information challenges , the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century concepts like individuals will outlive their organization , how to defines one 's goal and contribution are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face , since , this is the realities i highly recommend this book to anyone , not just ceo executives , but those want to know more about oneself , how to behave and contribute in this knowledge base world
regrettably , peter drucker passed away just a few days after i picked up this 1999 release at the age of 89 \( in 1999 \) , drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business his chapter on information challenges , at 38 pages one of the longest in the book , drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data few companies exemplify this better than wal mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain
if you manage a large firm , be responsible and read it
drucker is a master at business management and a great visionary , this book is a must for anyone planning for the future craigadams ne

harper neeld 's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author 's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband , interviews with other widows widowers , and discussions of phases of the grieving process i would rate this book highly , along with one of my favorite grief authors , thanatologist alan wolfelt \( e g understanding your grief books \) harper neeld seamlessly combines her painful , personal story with factual , helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks i have read on widowhood i used the introspective questions with my grief therapist , who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught
my friends keep telling me i should write a book about my grief , but i think that what elizabeth harper neeld has written is better than anything i could produce this book is so readable and covers every aspect of grief my husband died four months ago , and i have found this book exceedingly helpful elixabeth put the most important step first to experience and express grief fully there are hundreds of ways to run away from grief , but it is necessary to feel it to heal it i was given the best advice by a friend who said to lean into the pain the second choice to endure with patience , has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself thank you , elizabeth for this beautiful book i will buy it for everyone i know who loses someone dear
after my husband died suddenly , i was beside myself my aunt insisted on placing this book in my hands it has been a lifeline to me i have purchased well over 20 copies of it for friends and continue to haunt my local bookstore when they do n't have it on the shelf for immediate purchase having read almost every grief book out there , do n't waste your money , just buy this one and learn to live again
my husband of 1 5 years but my soul mate of a lifetime passed away a year ago i have read so many books of grief , but only seven choices helped me find hope this book is an honest account of a difficult journey , and like all things that are done with honesty it touches the core of who we are
i bought this book in audio for a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer after 44 years of marriage the day it arrived , she listened to both tapes and said she could so identify with the author she thanked me profusely for this gift and said she was going to listen to it in her car as she drove her husband has only been dead a month as of this writing , and neither of us expects her to heal in record time , but she found comfort in this book and made me so glad this is the one i chose to send her based on her comments , i strongly recommend it to the grieving , especially widows
this is a great guide that i recommend to all of you who are looking for scholarships check this out thoroughly , and if you feel you 're up to the total scholarship plus being paid for training that west point offers , i recommend that you then go on to read west point character leadership education by norman thomas remick to understand the importance of this college that is the best kept secret and the one that everyone has a good chance of getting into
it covered a lot of ground i feel like i got my money 's worth
tobias writes a bible in personal financial investment without the lack of humor and personal touch he is clear on investing principles he preaches , states his opinions precisely and still provide overviews of investments he believes are pure baloney
this is the only investment book i can get my husband to read i gave copies of the 1987 edition to my sons when they graduated from college and i am giving them the 2005 edition as they approach 40 tobias has been consistent with his advice over the years he does not promise to make you rich but he gives guidelines for ending up with a comfortable retirement partly by getting one to acknowledge what one does not know
i can honestly say this book changed my life by opening my eyes on how investing and money really work over the long term
i have found the advice in this book to be invaluable you simply ca n't go wrong those looking for a book with stock mutual fund investing howtos should keep looking however this is a broad brush stroke at handling one 's money period if you are going to read this book , be sure to read my vast fortune as well the two tell quite a story and show that mr tobias is not just blowing air between his gums this book is eminently readable and there is just not much wrong with it everything from what to do if you inherit wealth , to what type of life insurance to buy , to how to buy a car , to how to use the internet to save money on staying at a hotel are covered , as well as everything in between read this and prosper
it 's clear , easy to understand and remember also entertaining and insightful
first and foremost , tobias has a keen sense of humor , which makes this book an enjoyment to read in my opinion that is the most important thing because if a book is dull albeit with good advice , then you 're probably not going to get much from it the real world examples and down to earth suggestions make this something for everyone , not just the wealthy this was the first investment book that i had ever purchased and although it is n't the only one i own , it 's the one i refer to most often i 've never taken a business class , and my career is completely unrelated , but i needed something to help me plan my finances i learned an extraordinary about from tobias and i definitely feel confident going into the investment world
i enjoy andrew tobias' writings he is witty , concise and intelligent while i do n't agree with all of his advice , most of his reasoning stands up i also highly recommend tyson 's investing for dummies , personal finance for dummies and mutual funds for dummies
i read this book because of i thought it was going to be funny , and it was but i was not expecting to learn anything new , having read several books on investing so i got a pleasant surprise when i actually did learn something i would say this would be a great first investment book to read
the book , the only investment guide you 'll ever need is a gross misnomer at best , the book should be entitled a good personal finance guide if a person bought the book , as i did , for expert stock market investment guidance , he she may likely be highly disappointed the book contains very good personal finance guidance , that 's all way overstated with the title !
very enjoyable to watch tv from that era no cell phones , vintage cars the dvd is very good in terms of color , quality of sound , etc however , i did encounter freezing at the beginning of an episode otherwise , i recommend this product
i found this story sad but very good with nice ending she suffers alot but i really enjoyed the ending
danielle steele is a writer who wields the written word like an artist using story lines that attract you by their sheer difference from what people experience in their own tame lives widowhood , single parenting , trauma , and grudging admiration make this story compelling a tear jerker i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the talent of a successful story teller
i like danielle steel and i'm happy becouse i do n't need to go to the store to see what 's new i have a good friend amazon com i'm very satisfied about all items i received whenever i need something , i look for my friend i trust amazon com and i'm very sorry i do n't know much more english words to show you how well we get along each other it 's easy , fast , safe and be sure you 'll never send back items received becouse they come faster than you believe and the best shape you 've ever seen just go to amazon com and you 'll see ! dorina \( i apologise for my mistakes that more than likely i made !
this being the first book i read by danielle steel i expected more than what i got since i love the moive verisons of her book the start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and i like alittle unpredicatable stuff
this is a story with a happy ending about liz sutherland , an attorney , who lost her husband by a gun shot wound he was killed when a man shot him at their office when he ran an errand on christmas day the killer was an abusive and enraged husband of one of their clients the sutherlands were family law attorneys and defended domestic abuse cases
the beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end the house on hope st , has tones of her earlier and much superior book accident , which i highly recommend pick it up for a good read , but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor , everything is textbook romance
this book is a predictable love story , what we 've all come to love about danielle steel 's books perhaps we 'd like a bit more unpredictability , but most of the time i enjoy the story anyway reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have , that 's always a good thing it also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you , you could probably survive this was n't her best book , but i thought it was decent if you want to read a really great love story by steel , check out the ring , to love again , summers end , answered prayers amp passions promise
august escoffier was known as the king of chefs and the chef of kings this book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts escoffier defined the benchmark for classic french cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots , much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music you can find essences of classic french cooking in even the lowliest diner fare
i am very annoyed that people who do not have any idea of what this book is , have the audacity to rate it if you made the mistake of buying this book thinking it was a cookbook that is your own fault ! please do n't rate escoffiers culinary writings based on your own stupidity
it has been said that the true test of any work , whether it be a piece of art , music , or a book is the test of time this volume has done just that ! first written almost 100 years ago these recipes are just as relavent today as they were in escoffier 's time please be aware that this book is not for the beginner the author assumes that the reader has developed the skills and methods that are needed in any kitchen i have worked professionally as a chef for 25 years and assure you that this work will always be on my bookshelf when it comes to classic french cuisine this work is indispensible
this is the book on classic french technique and cuisine by the master chef , auguste escoffier
great book not for the home maker of course must have a basic understanding of the art this book is great for refference there is no pics only usefull infomatio
i teach culinary arts and this is a must have for every serious cook and future chef you must have some knowledge of professional culinary techniques to be able to understand and use this book as one reviewer wrote , this is not a cookbook , it is a reference book , and my students use it when they have to do research work
the book is probably the best reference i 've seen what it is n't is a cookbook for beginners i 'd recommend it for someone that already knows their way around a kitchen and wants a source for myriad \( well only 5100 \) ideas
there 's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject , but mr winchester abuses the privilege there 's no digression too minute , no reference too arcane , no place where one word ca n't be replaced with 100 when he does finally get to a set of pertinent points , the writing is excellent that 's what kept me from giving it a worse review too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy brand mixed nuts
winchester , a geologist and proven writer , is a perfect choice for chronicling the 1906 san francisco earthquake i currently live and work in sf , and enjoyed listening to the book on my mp3 player while commuting in the muni subways true to form , winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself , and instead develops the events which lead up to the event first in a geological perspective , and second in a sociological one
plate tectontics yawn hey the continents move , we all know that but what you did n't know is why , what happens with they suddenly move quite quickly if you live along either the northern or southern end of the san andreas fault you owe it to yourself to read this book lets just say , i wo n't be living there anytime soon
a lot of good factual information written in a readable fashion i want my family to read this book anyone who lives in the san francisco bay area should read this ! i 've already ordered another copy as a gift
a crack in the edge of the world is a great read that i especially recommend to all whom live , have lived or who have simply just visited the san francisco region of california to all these individuals , it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906 this book covers that momentous year and much more as well
a crack in the edge of the world by simon winchester is about the catastrophic 1906 san francisco earthquake and fire this being the centennial of the event , there have been a lot of books produced about it , but i had heard good things about winchester and his writing , so this is the one i picked i 'll have to find another one to read that has the info i was looking for i was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives i wanted to read about families separated and united , romances and businesses i wanted to read about human emotion this is not the book for that , but that 's not to say that it does n't have merit i learned about plate tectonics , the formation of the world , the settlement of the american west , earthquakes in the midwest , and much more , but only 50 75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in san francisco , and once the fire it put out , the book quickly ends there is a little discussion about the rebuilding , but mostly just to disparage the effort winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling his research is excellent , and i did learn quite a bit , enough to sleep well in my stable state of wisconsin and ensure that i 'll never visit california
geologist turned journalist simon winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing , of which a crack in the edge of the world america and the great california earthquake of 1906 is a very good example however , his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long , instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books krakatoa and the map that changed the world for example , though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes \( from plate to shining plate \) , it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the new madrid , missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811 , transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake 's history , than a lucid , mesmerizing account of north america 's tectonic history \( for a more lucid , better written account , one should turn to john mcphee 's books , most notably those comprising his annals of the former world \) in a similar vein , his chapters on the san francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact , than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself but to his credit , winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information , most notably in his descriptions of seismologist frank richter 's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears richter 's name however , if you are interested in a sprawling , occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake , then a crack in the edge of the world may indeed be of interest to you , the potential customer and reader
i am always sad to finish one of mr winchester 's books they are definitely not to be read in one sitting and because they stay with you for so long , it is as if you have finished a memorable semester by the time you put the book back on the shelf true , they are discursive but wonderfully so , and crack more than most indeed , the cover serves as a hint of things to come folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear
with the 100th anniversary of the great san francisco earthquake i eagerly anticipated winchester 's latest book i highly enjoyed the map that changed the world and krakatoa and i expected a similarly great book this time
how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest \? one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich \? s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus , everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding
the alternate title of this book should be the complete and only guide to college degrees by mail and internet you will need to read excellent and up to date information regarding courses , tuition , residency requirements i will finally be able to confidently and comfortably select 'the' masters program that is right for me ! tuition is quite varied and ranges from low to very high bears' guide saved me the time and frustration of looking at schools with astronomically high tuition rates if you are just beginning to look at distance learning programs , have been looking for awhile and are not able to make a decision , or you are just thinking about a dlp , this book is essential
if you want to get your education and not go into slavery with your student loans then get this book asap , it covers just about everything one needs to know on how to get your degree i really think the future of higher education is going this way but if you want to spend a lot of time , money , grief and get a real ration of manure then do n't read this book
and the band played on is an act of phenomenal research and writing , and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling , political bumbling , and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many , the scientific in fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives , and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives , but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they did n't want to do the work , did n't want to spend the money , or did n't want to anger certain political groups gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many
good stories work on several levels they are multi dimensional views of the same event to honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the aids epidemic , i reread randy shilts 's groundbreaking work , which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the cdc
to me this important expose on the begining of the aids crises and reagan 's response is extremely important it 's now classic and old information but it 's a valuable history lesson we all must read
the sexual revolution is over , wrote an old revolutionist named p j o'rourke , and the microbes won this book , by an sf journalist now dead from aids , tells how the microbes won the war
you want to read a horror story \? this is it this is the shameful way our government dealt with aids in the first six years it appeared in the country by doing nothing at all
having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but , this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy , it is extremely informative and , if read with an open mind , refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on just to let the information sink in
having seen the film that this book is based on several times , i was curious to read into the whole story and this book does not pack any punches
the amazing part of this tragedy is that shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans , directly or indirectly
i was required to read this text for a class i would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure i found that this text is very attention grabbing , and it is extremly informational i would recommend this text to others
shilts' great book shows us how much of the aids related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided the book opens with the july 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of american independence and closes with the death of hollywood star rock hudson , whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous aids casualties could not
i teach practical game theory for executives this book its an excellent complementary material for the course
if you are really into learning microeconomics right form the start , this is the book for you
i am an unabashed admirer of howard zinn , but i am tremendously impressed with paul johnson 's a history of the american people i read this book while attending graduate school , years after reading zinn 's fascinating people 's history of the united states johnson 's interrogation of the polemic characters , social movements , and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well detailed although i consider myself a moderate liberal , i was intrigued on how johnson describes certain historical figures , for instances , unlike zinn , johnson reveres business potentates , such as rockefeller and drew , for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century he is exceedingly critical of thomas jefferson , but he adulates andrew jackson for his gallantry during the battle of new orleans i recommend students , scholars , general readers , and history buffs , to read this thought provoking book with zinn 's people 's history to procure a well balanced understanding of american history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation
while i would n't recommend that my students read only paul johnson 's work on us history , i would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the american people government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today he does not shy away from criticism where it is due , but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due even if it means offending some politically correct ears
paul johnson 's history of the american people is a great response to howard zinn 's work johnson 's offers a conservative take on much of the events and people that zinn criticizes harshly the book is a fairly optimistic work , speaking to the resilience and ingenuity of the american people i particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the nixon and coolidge presidency and his criticisms of jfk paul johnson has an interesting perspective on american history , as he did not learn about as a child growing up in england he appproaches american history with a certain zeal not found in other historian 's works i really enjoyed reading the book after reading zinn 's work
i had to read this for a us history class i took in college and when i received it , groaned at the size of the book but when i started reading it , i found that i really enjoyed it it gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book its a big one but very interesting so you wo n't mind that at all like one of the other reviewers mentioned , i wish that i did n't have to stop and highlight and take notes as i was reading because this could be purely a leisurely read if you are into history
this is perhaps the best concise history of the united states out there johnson writes beautifully , and , unlike howard zinn , he does not let ideology completely dominate the book but be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one , as it 's a heavyweight
i had to read this book for my college us history class this is the most interesting history book i have ever read besides making a good college text , this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature true he does go on and on about how good the north american weather is , but i say this is only natural for a british chap \) it is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book
this has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a british historian the author admittedly is a strong admirer of the american people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live he supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey we are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that i studied going through school in the 1930 's and 1940 's alas , maybe washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all
mr johnson brings the history of the united states to life in profound and exciting ways i now emerge from four months of reading and intensive cross study with a well marked copy of this book and a better understanding of our great nation than ever before i am already anticipating re reading certain portions in order to use them in teaching
at over 1 , 000 pages of information , this book looks very intimidating it 's so fascinating , however , and so well constructed , that the pages go by very quickly entertaining and highly educational
i really enjoyed this book , in that its not the usual wine and roses type text he shows america warts and all and i found it most refreshing well done
i just reread this book for the second time i have n't read it since it came out a few years ago i enjoyed it this time around as much as i did the first time the book has everything , mystery , romance , humor , and sadness it 's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end the main plot is around callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on tv she is approached by a woman \( suzanne \) who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant after some investigating and tests , suzanne is proved correct but a baby stealing selling scheme is uncovered in the process callie is determined to get to the bottom of it while that is going on she has to deal with her ex husband jake being brought in on her dig , he 's an anthropologist i do n't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed , reconciled and explored callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval it is a wonderful love story and mystery i think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction
the story seems to go on forever it is a novel after all a very long one each character possesses his her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession the final showdown is worth the reading and waiting it is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery who is the person behind all the killings romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception conveniently , dr dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case her own that leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth the man she never gets over is there to win her heart again her brother who she did n't grow up with has his own love interest a divorced couple find each other once more everything boils down to loyalty among friends , lovers , and family members not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading
normally i like nora roberts , but this book was a very tough read callie , the main character , was not likeable whatsoever she was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth she did not come across as strong or self sufficient , just nasty it was not entertaining , just tiresome i started skimming towards the end because i just wanted to get through it
roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer this is a gripping story i was glued to the book till the very end
as the previous reviewers have already stated , this story encompasses many plots all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another callie dunbrook , archeologist , out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team her ex husband anthropologist , jake graystone not only do callie and jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of woodsboro , md , callie has a bigger surprise in store for her the discovery of a birth mother , father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction this story plays many different angles , but nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters doug , lana , little ty , suzanne , jay , vivian and elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team , and i especially like digger ! definitely a nora book you wo n't want to miss birthright is a great find
this is one of nora roberts' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite i adore this book the characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex husband what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances \( including roberts \) definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
i have been a longtime fan of robert 's work unfortunately , lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive this was refreshingly new and i read it twice before putting it down
this book is worth reading if only for his journalistic sections of his personal stay in an abandoned station in the arctic also , his section which describes the equipment used is pretty fun to read once you 've finished the story
having now read all four currently published dreams in this series , the rifles , which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages \( 70 of source notes , glossaries , etc \) seems the most strange and dream like it is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue , historical research , and imagination the ill starred franklin expedition of 1845 1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume 's take on the larger series theme of european and native american interaction two central aspects of this theme are the canadian relocation of inuit peoples in the 1950 's from quebec to various arctic islands , and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples as in each of the other dreams , vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the rifle text , having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children 's sand box , and ice bergs jutting from a tranquil sea landscape descriptions are consistent in their non romantic portrayal of desolation , serenity , and danger as vollmann states in an end note , it is a sort of companion piece to the ice shirt both take place in the north american arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the ages in which each novel dwells beyond the historical contexts of this novel , there is the sad twisted love story between the modern inuit quebecois girl reepah subzero \( who should be added to the list of male female counterparts i mention in my review of argall \) but this is no ordinary love , since it sometimes involves captain franklin , his wife , the author himself , and the inuit goddess sedna the author 's alter ego subzero , exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with captain franklin as though time and place were immaterial in fact , distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it 's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters on page 120 vollmann \( or is it subzero \? \) asks , are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you \? there are similar sequences in the ice shirt , and to lesser degrees in fathers crows , and argall \( each work uniquely powerful worthwhile \) , but here in the most modern dream this timelessness is much more pronounced sound confusing \? check out the source notes for hints clues if necessary , but it definitely helps to stay alert to which voices are speaking \( the narrative frequently alters between 1st , 2nd , and 3rd person \) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author 's own \( mis \) adventures in modern day arctic quebec in relation to for insight into the original franklin expeditions with vollmann 's seven dreams series it 's best to read on and not get bogged down , because a lot of stuff that does n't make sense at first will make sense later
i enjoyed reading the rifles quite a bit that being said , it was not quite up to par with the ice shirt the plight of the native people of northern canada \( it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves \) is not something one usually reads about while there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples , the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the great white explorers and have little to do with those living there i enjoy how vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters , leaving them to become real humans i will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment
although though it may be hard to begin vollmann 's 7 dreams series because each book in the series is so massive , it is certainly worth the time not only is vollman attempting to create , with some fiction , the entire history of north america , each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking new people , names , histories , and unique grammar reflective to the period a truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice , vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears , but since each is complete in itself , that does not matter i look forward to his next dream
this book was given to me the copy i have is the 1932 printing i know now how lucky i am to own it after finishing it was very hard to put down other books i have read about him didn't touch on his gentleness and how it affected not only his marriage but , the war sometimes i think now , he worried too much about others feelings such as inept generals and that lunatic wife , mary todd who's temper tantrums were infamous like he had enough rocks in his sack without strife at home i so pity him , even now that he is beyond all cares and woe god bless you sir and give you the peace that so eluded you here on earth
the storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes americans do n't have to abraham lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness , yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties , which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic this book is a labor of love by mr carnegie about his hero it 's his way of making his hero available to us all i love particularly the introduction in which mr carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it this is one of the best books i 've ever read all the wisdom and insight mr carnegie ever collected in his how to books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here , because lincoln exemplified everything that mr carnegie ever taught this book is what will keep mr carnegie 's name alive , long after his institute has folded and his how to books have gone out of print in this book mr carnegie captures the living reality of lincoln , his wisdom , his virtues , his beautiful and unfettered english prose , his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind , his deep reverence , and his abiding love this is a book that you never finish the experience remains with you besides changing forever the way you think about lincoln , it 'll change the way you think about yourself this book is not overtly religious , but i 'd recommend it alongside bonhoeffer 's cost of discipleship , chesterton 's everlasting man , and thomas merton 's seven storey mountain
if you do n't know anything about lincoln this book is for you !
i agree with oceandweller who said he she wished this book were still in print so he she could send a copy to all his her friends this book is terrific right from page one until the very end i bought this book used , i forget how much i paid whatever i paid , it was worth it it 's not often in one 's lifetime that one comes across a book like this , both educational and entertaining dale carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just ca n't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends not only was the story so interesting , but lincoln comes across as the wisest of men with malice towards none and charity for all these , his words , keep echoing in my mind though he fought the civil war , a terribly bloody war , he did this to save this great nation his words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies' \( st luke 6 27 \) lincoln had no church he said , when i do good , i feel good , when i do bad i feel bad , and that 's my religion but through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to after reading this book , for me lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom i know something \( there may be others like him but i have n't met or read about them \) this book should be required reading in all the high schools in my humble opinion
i first read this book in early 1994 it left a lasting impression on me the account of abraham lincoln 's life is remarkably written by dale carnegie this is not the story about the lincoln that we learned about in school lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest presidents mr carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the white house we can see the problems that lincoln had while in the office of president it would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if lincoln had not been president because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable for example , the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly this book should be read by anyone who has an interest in political science or just wants to know more about the president this is a very interesting book that i found hard to put down i have read this many times and i cherish each moment that i spend reading the book
all i can say is , if you really want to get most out of your life , and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day , you should read this book
i recieved this book \( which is how to win friends and influence people and how to stop worrying and start living in one edition \) as a gift from a dale carnegie instructor \( thanks again ron ! \) this has been quite possible the greatest gift anyone has given me i recommend this book to anybody and everybody reading this book will increase your confidence and your skills incredibly not reading it would be a punishment to yourself , and you deserve better
a lost love he mourned for his whole life , an extremely difficult wife , endless attempts to undermine his authority , constant personal sorrow who knew \? this book helped me understand and admire lincoln the man , versus lincoln the president they are both likable characters
this is a thoroughly engrossing book i could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother 's collection of old books it inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that i do this book talks about the lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes i was impressed with the fact that lincoln totally despised slavery especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers his triumphs and failures make him seem much more human not only was he a great president , but a great human being as well it illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain if you can get your hands on this book , it is a must read
it is a superbly written book about one of the greatest leaders that mankind has known it is amazing how lincoln , from humble origins , shaped up to become so great he is an insipiration to all i only wish that this book was in print i would send it to several of my friends
i have been a manager for over 10 years , and have worked in different industries and different countries and i gladly admit i still have a lot to learn concerning management this book talks about concepts we know we should all be applying , such as learning from mistakes , responsibility and organization , attention to details as well as to a master plan , communication , etc however understanding how churchill put these concepts to work is fascinating i did not know that much about churchill in the first place , perhaps that is why i enjoyed the book so much it is a nice change from ceos' biographies and yes , i am putting some of what i read to work , so it was worth my time and money
i just completed this book yesterday and i must confess if it was any longer i might not have while it was mildly entertaining , it contains little that is new or particularly informative the book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in churchill 's life many of the comparisons seem strained in fact , comparing churchill 's almost single handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition , seems inappropriate and a little silly it 's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business , or otherwise these kernals are relatively simple and \( it seems to me \) obvious it begs the question , why , exactly , do we need a book such as this \? the people most apt to pick up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for churchill if so , those people will likely have read books which are more informative , historically significant , insightful and generally worthwhile if this is your first introduction to churchill , do not let it be your last overall , i think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time
as a longtime fan of churchill , and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment , the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading well it was but only from the 'fan' position the author sets out with good intentions and early in the book he relates churchill ways back into the context of today 's executive 's environment but , by the middle , and then thereafter , he 's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no real relevance to application to today 's leadership 'student' at times mr hayward really is squeezing the pips to show winston as a model to follow i 've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary has n't picked up on the idea if you want to understand churchill it 's a good read if it 's leadership you want you 'll have to browse further
i'm going to say something that might sound odd this is not a leadership book it deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of churchill 's style , but strangely not his executive success in the face of adversity and hayward 's assertion that churchill 's style is like that of an executive seems a little red faced hayward spends a lot of time defending against churchill 's critics that churchill was disorganized and a bad judge of character in all likelihood , he is forcing churchill into a category that he does not belong indeed , churchill may have been disorganized , but he was a darn good prime minister my opinion is that churchill deserves more than this in place of this book , i would recommend lincoln on leadership
as we all know too well , in the flow of flotsam from academe , there is seldom material that is both readable and edifying often neither quality is present this book , churchill on leadership , scores high in both categories hayward 's obvious in depth knowledge of churchill and his times enabled him to organize the vast storehouse of material available into a useful and unique way of teaching the leadership principles churchill personified god knows the lak of leadership today evidences the extreme need for what hayward has wrought
churchill 's leadership and perseverance carry this book the lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial as if summing up churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims what mr hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us \( women included \) i learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work \( i too can work on my short comings \) he had many failures , some fatal for a politician , but continued to soldier on \( i too can persevere \) he stuck with his own sense of self worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished \( i too can maintain confidence against adversity \) the maxims , mr hayward , are not needed but thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth , where we can all learn from his extraordinary life
steven hayward places churchill 's experience and approach to executive problem solving into historical context this is a must read book for students of leadership amp management as well as fans of sir winston a relatively short book about such a significant topic , but well worth the tim
i love these examples explanations books the rules make sense when you can get decent examples , and these books do a good job of that
great book definitely does n't cover every area of torts that you 're going to need to know for your course \( iied , false imprisonment , etc \) get gilberts or emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though also if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules \( even if it 's just a difference in semantics \) use your prof 's rules when working the examples writing out your answers to the examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you wo n't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester
the book is great as it is , no doubt , but the older editions do not have products liability in them , which is vital to your studies make sure you get the latest edition , which has two chapters on pl
this book is very easy to read and allows for easy digestion of complex principles i find it to be very useful in understanding torts
very seldom is a sequel better than the original terminator 2 comes to mind , along with perhaps the empire strikes back and the aliens series but for the most part , sequels suck the opposite is true in law school support texts i borrowed the 2nd edition of this book from a friend and found it to be utter crap \( think crap on the level of the third austin powers or the mummy returns \) it was almost as if glannon , during a celebration over the success of his civ pro e e success , got hammered and wrote torts e e 1st and 2nd eds in a drunken stupor it seems , though , that for the 3rd ed he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor it 's still not civ pro e e , which single handedly rescued me from oblivion \( and likely suicide \) in that course , but it is definitely worth having
for some reason i think amazon 's reviews bleed through different editions
this book was actually recommended for our torts class and i am so glad it was glannon is a great writer and he makes things easy and fun to read \( sometimes he is a little too punny \) his examples are a great help too , especially around exam time his practice exams are great at helping you to spot the issues and organize them clearly glannon also wrote examples and explanations for civil pro that is highly recommended also
buy this and high court summaries keyed to your casebook and you 're set i also used the gilberts and sum and substance 1l tapes while commuting to school the best preparation with the least effort awesome !
as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective , to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i'm an honor roll student with straight a 's in english i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death it did me pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill , the only good part of this book was herbert he was the only one i liked my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it yes , this book has given dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could bear in a nutshell its definately a college read
my first complete dickens book was a tale of two cities since that was an idealistic romance novel , this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature instead of heart wrending sacrifices , i found painful ingratitude instead of perfect heroines , i found scheming , insensitive women this book was not anything i expected with regards to characterization and theme however , i would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much , much better it was not a very entertaining read at all , but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better this book may not turn one 's daydreams on paper , but it is a solid , landmark work of literature
perhaps the greates novel i have ever read not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life you ca n't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance
first of all , in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos , all i can say is that i hope that they did n't read the book , for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic i digress i am here to dispel some myths since this book is often assigned in school , and perceived as important , as another reviewer noted , i think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand dickens' novels , however , work on multiple level there certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel , but on the surface , it 's just a good read i read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it so , do n't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you one piece of advice , read the real ending before the changed ending \( though the changed one will appear first \) i felt that the original one was far better , more relevant , and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first happy reading
this book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great , so i hate it ! this book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time , but i hate it , because the title is misleading what the dickens does the author think he 's doing giving this book a title like that !
of all the dickens novels i 've read , this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life in terms of art , this is probably his supreme achievement the plot is n't as convoluted as it is in bleak house the action is more dramatic the female characters , particularly estella , are more believable and \( in the case of miss havisham , for instance \) more intriguing the sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control the humor still abounds the language is easier to read but no less descriptive no , it 's not a perfect work there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents , and far too many ridiculous coincidences but to me , at least , great expectations is dickens' greatest achievement
read it , no matter what , no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years , get into it and you wo n't be able to put it down and then you 'll think , that reviewer was right i love this book it was the best book that i read in my junior year , it was n't required reading , but it should be ! and miss havisham and estella ! after reading about the endless virtues of lucy manette in a tale of two cities , i found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected read the book , love the book , accept the book and all of its truths , and then name your cat pip
great expectations is filled with ambition , greed , cruelty , and love it is one of the best books i have ever read in my high school years get entertained with mr joe and her violence towards pip and her husband mr joe gargery
great expectations by charles dickens was a very good novel in my eyes the main character pip believed , as a true victorian , that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions , and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions upon recieving his great expectations , he moves to london for a further education , and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen through pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be , and his views of a true gentlemen start to change with thanks to dickens and great expectations , we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen he may start as a poor orphan boy , like pip , or labour as a blacksmith , like joe truly , what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen , and social prestige has not a bit to do with it
dickens explores various sides of human nature in great expectations , as he tells the story of pip , a common , lower class , laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman along the storyline , dickens inserts several points that man has several sides the book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur , how quickly man can turn on his closest friend
this book is well written and very ambitious in its scope it is fascinating to get a people 's eye view of the rise of sun yat sen additionally it empathically covers the social response to mixed marriages by two very different cultures this is a women orienated book about a very tumultous time and ties the events together skillfully in the western u s and the emerging china of 100 years ago
when i received this book i was really eager to read it the whole storyline appealed to me and i was convinced , based on the first few chapters , that i would enjoy it i'm not sure when i changed my mind maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political china when i just wanted to know more about the main characters sometimes i felt as if the author could n't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story while her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative , the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side i found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts also , the ending \( which i wo n't give away \) sort of left me feeling cheated i suppose i could 've overlooked all of those things except for one thing the fact is , the main character just is n't very interesting or likeable to me , that 's a deal breaker
i have mixed feelings about this quasi romance novel about an american teacher named hope and po yu \( paul \) , her chinese student on one hand , it was often very interesting , as ms liu gives a lot of historical detail about san francisco and china on the other hand , the characters were rather shallow i did n't find hope , who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day , particularly appealing po yu was far more interesting , and was portrayed with some complexity and depth the romance between hope and po yu rang false for me \( honey , i first fell in love with you when i realized it was required for the plot to progress ! \) i still ca n't see what attracted them to each other also , did anyone else notice that any slight against hope is recorded with meticulous detail \( the rampant racism against chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned \) , but ms liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel a hearty blonde swede , a drunk , surly irishwoman , and hope 's one sided ly disagreeable mother in law to name a few also , she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize all the britons in the book are right o , jolly good bigots , and all the christians are consistently hypocritical , or stupid , or both in addition , much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they 're just the opposite and to top it all off , the ending was forced this novel could have been so much better as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents , she obviously had some fascinating material to work with and one more quibble one of hope and po yu 's daughters is named jennifer pearl in 1908 the name jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world cornwall , uk
using stories told by her grandfather , aimee liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in china the story starts in san francisco at the time of the big quake it is a love story of an american girl and a very educated chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a chinese person , much less married one her husband is a part of sun yet sen 's battle to topple the manchu dynasty within the novel is the history of china from the opium war in 1840 to the communist 's war of liberation in 1949 good insight into the people of china and their relationship with the western powers
i had to write a few words every now and then i hit upon an author that pulls and pushes at your heart i listen to dozens of audio books every month driving to and from work this story was so very well written it has real life in it it has passion , love , danger , devotion , understanding , pain it has it all it is a must read listen for historical and just plain enjoyment reasons \( the plot is in the description \) i must now seek out other books by this author if you want to fill moments of your life with a treasure include this story doroth
while i do n't believe that elizabeth was totally the excellent strategizer , i do believe she was well advised and did her own thinking this book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by elizabeth i and how it would apply in business today there are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples the major portion of the book covers the image that elizabeth set forth by taking on being the image of the mother mary \( catholic church \) to her subjects , thus , to make the people more accepting of the new church of england as the religious seat of power , thus diffusing the vatican 's hold over the people my only complaint , like others opinions , there were no mention of where things went wrong , only highlighting the good things this is a very good book still and i recommend it along with another book called big chief elizabeth \( which is more of the history of the new world and elizabeth 's funding of the voyages to capture more land \)
elizabeth i ceo was a wonderful reading that inspired me a lot my wife and i kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first , it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished the lessons of elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring
i do have a comment on history content , in response to one of other reviews i read let 's keep in mind that , if it was n't for elizabeth i there would be no empire to pass along to james i england would be swallowed up by either france or spain surely , elizabeth i made a few mistakes like every other monarch , but they fade out in comparison to her achievements she truly did build an empire , and serves as a great example of a true leader
oriana fallaci died recently and loss will be felt in the europe that decided to ignore her once she voiced her criticism of it mindless poltical correctness that threatens its very existence the force of reason is a call for europe to wake up and fight back against islamization
a comprhensive expose' of islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in america that the muslims are just like us

i used to admire this woman she was smart she inspired me when i was young it is a shame , however , to see her intellectual decline in her last years was this the effect cancer had on her brain \? first , i ca n't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called the force of reason she appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality second , she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts for instance , she quietly forgot the role of christianity in the conquest of the americas and the slaughter of the indian races or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the european powers and what about the survival of catholicism in spain in spite of eight centuries of muslim domination \? yes , there were churches and synagogues in muslim spain this manifesto does n't look very different from those fascists wrote about jews in europe in the 1930s poor woman
oriana fallaci is no longer among the living we will have to do without her unrelenting opposition to islamic nihilism she died in the united states her fellow europeans essentially expelled her from the continent they made fallaci 's final years a living hell as an ex catholic , i am more then a little irritated by the roman church 's capitulation to the radical muslims fallaci described herself as a christian atheist and was more of a defender of the true faith than its own hierarchy ! this catholic church without which the islamization of europe , the degeneration of europe into eurabia , could have never have developed this catholic church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted , added the author
the force of reason , by the late oriana fallaci , is an interesting book which provides criticisms of islam while exploring the possibility of widespread conquest of western civilizations and europe by the muslims apparently , the opposition was not too pleased with the force of reason or her previous publication the rage and the pride , as they have attempted numerous times to have the text banned and fallaci has also been the proud recipient of numerous threatening messages as a result of this , yet the text has become a bestseller in europe and , apparently , north america as well , as the book is currently ranked at 8 on this site 's bestseller list as of today she shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named master cecco who , in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs , was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the troy burnings fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them
this is high octane stuff and not for the faint of heart ms fallaci pulls no punches
oriana fallaci is the rocky marciano of italian letters to her , the best defense is a good offense if you 're pro islam you will hate this book if you 're anti islam you will love it if you 're sitting on the fence you 're in for a rough ride
this is ms fallaci 's forceful reason against the rising and insidious spread of radical islam into europe which she refers to as eurabia does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is \? are europe 's leaders , especially in her native italy , biased towards muslim sympathies in opposition to christian values \? an argument not likely to be considered by muslims or their leaders , though the muslim side should take note that 1 opposing and contrary views are inherent to the western tradition , and 2 many non muslims in the west remain skeptical about muslim claims to be a religion of peace , while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to non muslims that women are accorded merely partial human rights , depending on the degree of fundamentalist view and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social grievances
very informative and scary ms fallaci offers firsthand observances of what 's going on and what we may expect if we do n't wake up
i found this book to be so helpful that i ordered 20 copies for my team
i listened to a cd from the library then bought the book , simply to get the one time use id code required to take the test for about 20 bucks , you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths i'm a bit disappointed , at the lack of direction , e g
we are a small nonprofit and have all read this book , taken the test and know and value our strengths we use this knowledge of each other in our team and individual work , in thinking about our learning and what is next for our organization and personal growth
there are thousands of self help books in the management section of your local bookstore , covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people few of them are helpful , beyond trite statements about human behavior , and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research now , discover your strengths is an excellent book on both counts the gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years this book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people 's talents
just when i figured i had seen it all , now discover your strengths comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm a unique difference from others in its genre is the strengths finder profile \( can be interfaced on the internet \) it covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits chapter 4 , page 83 , does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four themes of leadership
if you 've ever wondered what your true talents \( i e strengths \) are , or wondered why you act and react as you do , this book is for you in my office , we use the book as a career development tool , and it enables us to help guide our staff in the direction that they are most talented , and therefore , most successful in the long term it has helped improve morale and communication additionally , this book helped me understand and appreciate myself on a new level , and it helped open doors of deeper understanding with my family i 'd buy this book for a business or personal gift any day ! it 's rewarding to have an understanding your strengths and then be able to act on them in a positive way
finding your strengths may be marcus buckingham 's finest work to date buckingham and clifton have succeeded in bringing to life an idea that is enormously practical and helpful using themes as a means of describing one 's gifts , buckingham and clifton have given me enormous insights about who i am and why i do the things i do more importantly , they have taught me not only to accept my weaknesses but how to management both my strengths and weaknesses , so that , i can learn to be better than anyone else in my strengths thank you marcus and donald
a fantastic book of weekness and strength , a human being is a mixture of weekness and strength equally and those among us who take work with thier strength come out successful regardless of the profession they are involve in , they can focus on thier strength rather than weakness , positive attitude regardless all the adversaries of a life i learned a great deal out of this marcus buckingham book and i strongly recommend to the book lovers do n't miss this one
by jeffrey w bennett , founder of laymentor and author of under the lontar palm
this book has its good points if anything , it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor , but it is not very accurate the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you , or if they do n't describe you at all this messes up the results , and it did not describe me very well i am not just in denial i have taken a lot of personality type tests , like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths so , although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths , it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology
having attended one of walter 's workshops on book selection , i look forward to his updated books he is , as he says , opinionated , but he backs up his opinions with solid expertise unlike other guide books , his is a lot of fun to read , which in this over information age , is an important consideration when choosing reference books
if you 're looking for clear , fun , expert advice about the books children truly enjoy look no further every parent , grandparent and teacher should have this on their shelf this is the best book to buy for a baby shower gift
being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen i was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor
i liked this book , it definitely gets you thinking about things differently i found it very interesting to look at how society and culture changed , including the dynamics between women and men as a result of , or coinciding with the onset of agriculture
this book has been especially useful for a university paper i was working on it passed some time since that but the concepts i read are still fresh in my memory , since it were concepts i 've been suspicious for a long time one might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male impotence , but if you take an impartial look you 'll find he is right do n't get me wrong i have no problems in beeing a man , but i'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure , on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman , that he is not a sissy or a gay wich is even worse , but , on the contrary , that he is a real macho , a sex machine that can score as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence it 's sad but it 's the reality
this is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published the fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man woman and the development of societies is indeed sad mcelvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering his imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy i guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership that 's what happened here do n't waste your time a disturbing aspect to this is that he 's teaching the next generation of leaders
this is the book i 've been looking for it explains the world we 're living in right now and where we 've been this book really gets to the root of the basic problem men ar n't able to be men because we 're afraid of our femininity so we 're half men , and we 're so angry at being half men that we take it out on women we blame them for it that 's it in a nutshell and it all started thousands of years ago , with the agricultural revolution , when we lost our place in society we were out of a job and we 've been playing catch up ever since and still are today it 's still going on note i'm writing this on the 10th day of the insane war we 're waging on iraq after reading this book , you 'll understand why these insecure , infantile itiots mask their impotence by waging war we are at this moment witnessing the catastrophic consequences of the hyper masculinity that he talks about as long as we define man as not a woman , we 're stuck
this is not one of the better books i have read on history that predates mankind before reading the book i knew that women were the first farmers the author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women i do not buy the argument
after reading an editorial in the washington post written by this author concerning the taliban 's treatment of women , i had to read this book this is truly an important and timely book that touches on everything that vexes our society today women 's rights , where men fit into the modern society , racism , and how religion has played an unfortunate part in keeping women down , and that 's just the tip of the iceberg it is a dense and challenging , but worthwhile read and when you get your copy , pass it around it should be shared ps someone should tell bill maher about this one it 's right up his alley
this book is a treasury of true american cooking , with the recipes our mothers and grandmothers loved , and that make fond memories for us some are still favorites for family and entertaining \( pineapple upside down cake , stroganoff casserole \) , others beg to be rediscovered \( imagine ! coca cola salad \) , all provide fascinating reading , with their accompanying histories , orginal ads and illustrations american century has rapidly become one of my favorite cookbooks , both for browsing and for adding to my collection of recipes that please and amaze
i use this book as a reference guide for my high school american history and african american studies classes everything in the world seems to be here including an old favorite from the 1960s , 'puree mongole ' this cookbook is easy to read and most recipes are simple to follow the best part for me , as a social studies teacher , is the gem of the history lessons and time lines associated with all the food preparations a real pleasure and a book that is priceless if you like the history of american cuisine
it is a good book to find popular american recipes cookies and quickbreads are delicious , and my husband likes the casserole chapter as i was born and raised outside the u s , the tidbits about american culinary history in the book are very fascinating i had to try exotics like soup mongole \( a campbell combination soup \) , and i admit it is pretty good the ethnic recipes that entered american mainstream are often americanized , but it should not be surprising because it is the american century cookbook after all
if your looking for it it 's in this book and a whole lot more my favorite recipes from childhood like grasshopper pie and wafer cakes even that strange perfection salad is there there are recipes for mystery cakes , heavenly hash , oh just tons of recipes each with a preface which talks about the recipes history if you like history and you like food this is a treasure there is a timeline of food happenings and section on the international influences on the american palette
i recently received a copy of the american century cookbook my wife and i have several dust covered recipe books that are largely ignored when it is time to cook up something new after one quick shuffle through this book however , we found ourself sitting together and going through the book as if it were , well what it is , an intriguing history book that accents its flavor with numerous recipes , pictures and facts several of my friends , including my parents and my in laws will be receiving their own copy of this wonderful historical treasure i may even have to buy myself another copy because my wife likes to dogear pages that she wants to come back to in this case it would have been easier to dogear those that she did not want to return to
when i started cooking about three years ago , i had absolutely no experience to draw from \( except for grilling and pancakes the two camping dishes i learned from my dad \) because i did not want to give half my salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my life , i decided i ought learned how to cook that is when i started collecting cookbooks i started with cooking for dummies and went on from there i quickly found that i had a knack for cooking and soon came to enjoy it as my cookbook collection grew , i quickly discovered that there were two types of cookbooks those you cook from and those you read this is the first cookbook that i have found is good for both the recipes included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse the recipes come on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the julia childs alike will be able to use it when you buy this book , and you certainly should buy this book , go directly to the recipe for blondies i had never heard of them before but they are cheap and easily made after i made the first batch , i made a double batch to take to work where i had just started let 's just say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier thanks , ms anderson
i 've just spent a delightful journey reading jean anderson 's american century cookook what a treasure , especially for those of us who savoured many of the dishes of this period but lost the recipes ! now we have them in an interesting , easy to read and make recipe roundup my copy ofjean anderson 's cookbook is tabberd with post its to preprare favorite recipes soon especially shrimp de johnghe \( page 120 \) and stroganoffcasserole \( page 151 \) i hope others will enjoy this cookbook as much as i anne anderson \( no relation !
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent , he had a crappy upbringing , that does not make for a good book
if you like strange stories , you will love running with scissors because it is just plain weird after reading this book , you will have a feeling that you just returned from the twilight zone
how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book the book was anything but funny i read about half , up to
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius , and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
one of the things i love about james patterson 's books is his prose it 's a no nonsense , no frills , i am what i am voice that does n't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language in judge jury , the story is written from a first person perspective that of fbi senior agent nick pellisante for years , nick has been on the trail of a powerful mafia don , named dominic cavello , and his efforts are about to pay off nick trails cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him
great book one of patterson 's best i had a hard time putting it down once i started on it combined some of the legal ease of john grisham
oh , this was a grabber nothing 's missing in this thrill a minute saga which has been voted the book i most enjoyed while staying in barbara 's guest room two guests now have been up all night reading judge and jury it 's featured prominently on my guest room book shelf with a strong recommendation that if they want to read a good yarn , this is it although everyone reports favorably on the book , it does make for some pretty droopy eyed siteseeing the next day i loved the premise of this one felt i knew the characters , and i thoroughly enjoyed the trip to ushuaia i never knew what the end of the world was like , but now i feel i 've been there as a writer myself , i marvel at james patterson 's output i guess if he experiences writer 's block , he just says , here , andrew , you write for a while whatever the procedure , they hit an ace with this one and , what 's really great is that while i'm still riding the crest of the wave on judge and jury , the news reports another new book about to be launched cross i ca n't wait !
once again , james patterson has us on the edge of our seats in another page turner he has created a brand new villain equally as detestable as gary soneji in the persona of mob boss dominic cavello when nicholas pellisante a k a nicky smiles joins forces with the sole survivor of a bus carrying the jurors for cavello 's trial which has been bombed by one of cavello 's guns for hire to catch the escaped cavello , the reader is in for the ride of a lifetime
if you 've read other patterson mysteries and enjoyed them , you 'll like this one , too there are no real surprises this novel trods the well worn mystery formula , but does so entertainingly yes , there are legal bloopers , but people do n't read novels like this to learn the law if you have n't read any patterson , you 'll probably like this if you like john grisham , for instance these are plot driven novels with not too much description or fine character development if you like law order , you 'll probably like this , too
i enjoyed the book , i like the suspense , the connection with the characters , i enjoyed james patterson suspense novels in the way he writes them and how the characters have their own identity and pesonaility
this book , like most all of james patterson 's books , kept me on the edge of my seat ! i could n't put it down
an engrossing story well written with twists and turns that make the reader want to turn the page or start the next chapter i personally found judge jury a more rewarding read than beach road
as judge jury , i would highly recommend this book patterson ca n't write a bad book , but this is one of his best
the watcher and other stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories i personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing the watcher deals with our protagonist watching the voting procedures in a home for invalids deranged etc the home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of italian society smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution the argentine ants is a type of mock horror story all of the above are extremely well written and executed although i did enjoy this book , i would suggest that readers unfamiliar with calvino try some of his masterpieces first , and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these
grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time \( arkansas , 1950s \) the events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young luke chandler
while reading a painted house , i had to keep reminding myself that this was a grisham book ! ! it honestly was not like anything else of his that i 've read , and i was happily surprised
john steinbeck is one of my favorite all time authors \( the grapes of wrath , east of eden \) grisham has managed to capture steinbeck 's style and weave a tale that captures the reader right from the first paragraph !
i really enjoyed this book and , not being a grisham fan \( at all \) , this is really saying something i do n't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading a painted house by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found and right he was this story was touching and fast paced it was enjoyable along the same lines as to kill a mockingbird \( the only courtroom story i 've ever enjoyed \) in its background and overall feel i did n't like the ending not because it was n't good and not because it did n't flow with the rest of the book \( a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together \) but because it 's not the way i wished it would go all in all a great book and highly recommendable
a painted house is a truely refreshing departure from the typical grisham novel i do believe twain would have been pleased sp may parallels \( not the least of which is the painting \) not since the client \( another grisham favorite \) has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist like some reviews , i found it hard to imagine that luke was a seven year old i think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does but the atmosphere painted by grisham draws the reader right into the backwater arkansas area in the hot , humid fields humorous , touching , and above all riveting
fast pace and at times intense kept my interest through the entire book
one of those very lovely coming of age stories this was truly an enjoyable book it has been 4 or 5 years since i have read it and the characters and unforgettable scenes still linger in my head
i read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that i was not in the right space to appreciate this book when i read it this was the most boring piece of literature ever written i know it was a period piece coming of age story etc , but pages upon pages of people picking cotton , talking about cotton , and talking about picking cotton zzzzzz it took me forever to finish because i kept passing out and having nightmares of yep , cotton
i realize this is an old title , i 've not had a chance to get to all of the back list , i only first read hiaasen a couple years ago
the mystery of why every single carl hiaasen book has n't been made into a movie has finally been solved suffice it to say that mr hiaasen should be allowed to slap demi moore until her head falls off , and his readers should have the right to go skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was strip tease the movie
i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character , erin , to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i , as a woman , just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did
hiaasen and dave barry in the same office how did anything ever get done at the miami herald \?
i just finished reading strip tease by carl hiaasen i found his writing to be typical hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected , sarcastic and witty in this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past
i would give it an 11 if i could this book is flawless from the first page , i was hooked the characters were the best i had ever read in a novel hiaasen 's humor was incredible i found myself laughing often even though the movie did n't cover as much ground as the book , i think the movie was much better than most people have let on read this book you will love it i have gone through 3 copies , i 've read it so much
recomendations for setting up a new kitchen good the rest is poo
great book easy to read perfect for the beginner cook spiral bound so it 's easy to fold the pages back would be nice to have some sort of menu planner , for example buy the ingredients for one dinner and some of those can be used the next day for lunch or another dinner so i dont have a box of 11 eggs left over i could dig and find another recipe that calls for eggs too but i'm a begginer cook i need someone to point me to the next recipe
this book is a good cookbook for poor , mac and cheese eating college students the receipes are easy to follow and cheap to make the only thing i did n't like about it was that is was too short more receipes please
as jean patterson 's sister , i was the target audience for this book since i was a college student with little to no experience in the kitchen , i needed help scrambled eggs were a nightmare , and macaroni and cheese from the box was as good as got
these recipes are quite simple and perhaps someone who is an experienced chef might not like them , but i am a singleton who works 60 hours per week and this book is full of quick dinners , and more importantly , stuff that i can make and take to work to reheat for lunch
i do n't know about college students , but i do know that i'm not sure how i 've made it 33 years in life without this book the great thing about this cookbook is , the meals do n't take 5 hours to prepare , and it 's all very simple almost as fast and easy as calling up the pizza delivery guy , and a helluva lot healthier i even impressed my new fiance
i wish somebody had given this book to me when i left the nest it covers all the basics and would have saved me a lot of calls to mom everything is organized so well , with what you need listed at the top of the page and careful , step by step instructions below the spiral cover makes it easy to set it down on the countertop and not worry about it flipping over to another page the perfect gift for a graduate
if it was n't for this book , i would have starved
this was another pinker book i could n't finish if he was a taxi driver he would take you from brooklyn to new york via san francisco sometimes even his asides have asides ! perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
interesting and insightful however it can occasionally lack clarity , lose the thread of what is being said even so , this is well worth snapping up for a summer read especially so if you have not read this kind of stuff before
to paraphrase from preface 's the famous dr noam chomsky 's \( a personal hero \) suggestion regarding our ignorance , we do not have any idea how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved i have read this book the year it first came out \( 1997 \) and many times over since should one still belive that thoughts , feelings , beliefs , meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood \? dr pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we , i mean any non psychologist , take for granted every day i use my mind every day \( my wife and co workers might want to argue otherwise , but they are wrong ! i do think on a daily basis \) yet i do n't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain is the 17 th century french philiospher rene descart right when he proclaimed i think therefore i am \? what insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since descart 's time \? another words , do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind \? dr pinker , now at harvard and a gaint in this field , do not have the answers as a matter of fact , he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true however , he has painted an overall picture on the state of art research on cognition oh , the book it has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried \( i think and hope \) to tickle readers' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs for example , under the standard equipment chapter , rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind he used the working definition of intlliegence \( ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one 's action to reach that point \) to illustrate that we use our desires \( ie the latest big screen sony tv \) and use our beliefs \( ie if i work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income \) to increase the chance of achieving that result \( i e watching the final four basketball games on sony big screen tv \) yet is this stimluli \( vivid and beautiful live college hoops on tv \) and response \( working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income \) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input \? do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all \? perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee jerk response to stimuli what about the molecular celluar level of the brain \? can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work \? from page 99 , dr pinker stated from the mathematicians warren mcculloch and walter pitts that neurons have one purpose in life add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded are you joking me \? with a description like this , it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level , as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness \( my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks \) that might be more important than any single cell another words , perhaps thoghts , ideas , imagination , emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these supercomputer networking this conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless what about complexity itself \? can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival \? it is beyond imagination of my limited mind \( no pun intended \) that perhaps i do n't have adequate brain power to understand my mind \? so why should i or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way \? a mental life is the result of my mind , and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space \? is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings \? why can i be peaceful and happy like i want to be every time i am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in los angeles \? dr pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish he only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas i keep this book close to me at an arm 's reach every time my mind fails me \( more frequent than i like now days and i am only 36 years old \) and i re read it over and over for its shear beauty , audacity , and clarity unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one 's mind
have you been amazed by the things your body can do \( and probably cannot do \) like the great stereo vision , the spatial hearing capability , the ease at which we learn speak update multiple languages how does our brain achieve all this \? how does our brain stores and incorporates new information \? where do human emotions come from \? what is the reason behind anger , fear and other multitudes of human emotions \? what is this thing called consciousness \? what is the reason behind the peculiar male , female behaviour \? what makes our ties to blood relations so strong \? why we find enjoyment in art \? what is life why do we exist \?
as a layman \( even athough i was trained as an engineer \) , i was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book , especially after i have read most of the editorial readers' reviews on the net i was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author his book my decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick over 600 pages the apparent level of complexity , judging from my random five finger test
asks , in one of his compositions , how one might expect a spider to comprehend arachnophobia
after becoming thoroughly jaded by the 'standard social science model' , and the brow beating of religion , this book was a near epiphany for myself the writing is crisp , witty , lucid , and provocative i contented myself with how he substantiated his research , albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior i'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized , but the genie is out of the bottle now , and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book pinker will bring you under this compulsion , if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry dare to read , dare to change , dare to think for some , pinker will open up a 'pandora 's box' , but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well this read will stike you like dorothy stepping into color for the first time this book is now permanently shelved for future reference , which is very telling , because i simply ca n't say that about the vast majority of material i 've read to this date
do n't be seduced by pinkermania he 's trapped in a little box and he wo n't be taking a look around anytime soon edward oaks could n't have said it better in his review
i first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection from being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last i had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense the natural world , human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole
look around you look at your computer , look at your keyboard look at all the things which are the beautiful creation of someone else 's thoughts ! thoughts can be powerful but on the other hand they can be destructive
what an awesome book some of the greatest things in life come in the smallest packages this book explains how thought leads to attitude leads to action leads to habit leads to character which leads to destiny it is my belief that this simple but powerful truth is one of the most overlooked principles in the world this book is literally a gold mine of awesome aphorisms and quotes including one of the greatest statements of all time men do not attract what they are but that which they are this is one the most important pieces of writing to grace the planet earth i do not leave home without it
ralph waldo emerson once said , a man is what he thinks about all day long we are we really , really are but the sad fact of the matter is , most of us do not really know what we are thinking in fact , i would say that most of us are n't really thinking at all most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things
small easy read that has to be the best self help , sprititually helpful but not at all religious can read it in a couple of hours but each line is so powerful and easily understood that you want to study each one
when thoroughly digested and fully comprehended , the principles and their practical application of james allen 's classic will change your life and more importantly the way you think about it , instantaneously
the idea in the book is known to most of us , yet we do n't realize how much impact it has on our life i wish i read this book when i was a teenager it might have changed the course of my life for better but it is never too late
1 discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you
this book is a quick read on how your thoughts determine your life it is shocking and hard for people to believe but your thoughts are the power that creates your inner and outer reality this book shows how your thoughts cause your character , circumstances , health , purpose , ideals , and level of achievement start with this book to learn how to control your thoughts and create your life
the concepts are not new and hardly new age there are no new ideas in this book , mr allan was just the first to present them is all james allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book he states in the book he who would accomplish little must sacrifice little he who would achieve much must sacrifice much he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book james allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure
okay , it 's a collection of far side comics , which is what i want , so it 's awesome for that reason but , the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing first , all the comics are black and white yeah , it 's not about the art and you do n't miss much without color , but come on , would a little color kill anyone \( especially ones that were originally color \) \? second , it 's pretty thin on strips , with 4 to a page most of the time \( a good amount \) sometimes 2 on a page , and even occassionally one comic on a single page ! it looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page
some of my earliest memories are filled with reading the far side on my father 's lap after the evening meal whenever i asked my parents for a one of the standard collections , they told me to wait , one day they would all be in one book then , for christmas one year , i got this book
gary larson never ceases to amaze me i 've been a religious follower of the far side for as long as i can remember i love the way he looks at the lighter side of life , yet some of the comics really hit home my favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark ! go larry you 're my super hero
lol ! ! ! ! this is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick \( in a good way \) mind the far side is timeless i laugh every time i read them , and that 's a good thing
how gary larson keeps coming up with this stuff i have no idea it seems like the more i read , the more i begin to laugh this particular gallery is totally hilarious if you do n't get the humor in the far side , my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books in fact , i heard the current president has n't got a far side chuckle since 1991
the far side is my favorite comic , out of all it is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard larson 's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on , comparing the picture to the caption , and it is hysterical there are scizophrenic kangaroos , plane driving sheep , duck relays , and pretty much any other twisted idea out there
sick , absurd humor is larson 's specialty , and in this collection , larson is at his best many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species , where animals get their revenge on humans others are based on themes from popular culture , such as tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling kemosabe that the music is starting they are funny , but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram if you are a fan of larson 's unique brand of humor , then you will love this collection
why not write a cartoon book that does n't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next \? ! that must have been similar to what gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books every joke is truly different from the next one ! and every joke is refreshingly original ! each joke comes from a thoughtful , clever and of course playful mind
i do n't know how the guy does it they keep getting funnier and there are always ones i 've never seen before , as well as the ones i 've always loved you wo n't be disappointed if you are a far side fan if you 're not a far side fan , well , then i ca n't help you
when i started work at my present job almost two years ago , i found that the place needed a little 'lightening up' it was casual already , to some extent , so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip' i picked up this calendar for my desk well , it began a new office ritual everyone wants to know the far side of the day ! sometimes , it 's the only funny thing to happen all day larson needs to come out of retirement
this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention , keep you enthralled , and refuse to let you stop reading i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is , but it 's because how good everything is until the very end that 's right , the incredible cop out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel this is deus ex machina in its finest form this is unexcusable in my opinion i just do n't get it i just do n't understand how one can \( seemingly \) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages i gave it two stars \( as opposed to one \) for fooling everyone into reading through this book this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
it 's probably been 15 years since i read it , and every person in the years since with whom i have discussed this book has said the same thing
intriguing as always , exciting from the first page , strong for the first 2 3rds and less editorializing than usual , but it 's just not as good as his higher concept novels but it 's still very enjoyable all the way through , and as always makes you think it feels a little dated now , but i re read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time sphere should definitely be a part of any crichton fan 's library skip the movie , though here , the science is less convincing than in jurrassic park \( which is mostly convincing , but stretched \) and prey \( which is better writing and fun , but not convincing \) but that does n't matter , because crichton can write an adventure like few others \( as long as character is n't important character 's here take backseat to concept and science \) pace , as always is good more a rollicking adventure than something to think about \( typical of later novels \) and quite enjoyable on that level it 's the kind of novel you 'll tear through in a weekend at most and that 's a good thing
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful , they need to be resrained earlier i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone , but sometimes it has to be
this is my favorite book by mr crichton i have read every book by him that i can find i just found the plot to be very suspenseful and mind bending granted i am 15 so maybe my knowledge of literature is not as high as some adults but this is a great read !
this 1987 thriller focuses on norman johnson , a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration , an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget
this is one of the most enjoyable books i have ever read it turned me into a crichton fanatic i have since read all of his books he creates suspense like no one else forget the movie
i'm amazed at how diverse a writer michael crichton is
i am satified with the servic
i am pleasantly surprised by the readability of this useful book the book kept my attention , and it was very helpful and informative
bryan garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing legal writing in plain english contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney some of these are obvious \( e g , use a readable typeface \) , while others are more nuanced \( e g , delete perhaps the legal drafter 's favorite legalism , provided that \) each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal be a good writer so that your reader does n't have to work so darn hard to understand you
bryan a garner is leading what might be a quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear , clean , unambiguous and even interesting prose this book is a recent addition to the garner arsenal , which includes the excellent the winning brief and a dictionary of modern legal usage the anonymous writer from new york who slams garner is wrong he claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges , who ultimately have to interpret it if the writing were clear to begin with , the parties would n't get to a judge they 'd likely settle and that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands , perhaps millions , of legal decisions over contract disputes , almost all arising from documents that were traditionally drafted and different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause that writer askes rhetorically whether garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople the rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language legal writing is written in english , the same english used to buy groceries , talk lovingly to your spouse , and complain to the doctor about what ails you there is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson , other than lawyers' need to feel like they 're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana and the writer 's praise of notwithstanding anything to the contrary as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement despite anything in this agreement to the contrary garner is a brilliant , insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use we know what happens with legalese litigation and contention and noncomprehension give plain english a try , with garner as your guide to aquinas 's trinity of wholeness , harmony , radiance , and of course clarity clarity clarity
excellent book , also modern legal usage , 2nd edition enough said
yikes ! there is no longer anywhere to hide , and there are no more excuses this book shows you how to drop the jargon , the gobbledygook , the archaisms , and the fluff so your writing is exposed now you must think and write clearly , and legal writing in plain english will help lawyers and law students have needed this book for a long time it 's superb \( from back cover
typical danielle steel fluff , but one of her better books a little of everything love , betrayal , tragedy , and hope
what i love most about danielle steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character , and this one is no different she has had , in my opinion , some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her
i usually do n't even browse through a ds book for some reason i bought and read this one i could n't put it down , could hardly stand to take a break to sleep i did cheer for deanna ben cried my eyes out over pilar , even though her character in the book was totally unlovable i did get frustrated in the end with deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting ben about the baby the visual descriptions make you feel like you 're really there i liked the fact that danielle and ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and did n't play games about their feelings the ending is a let down though the epilogue should have been set a few years down the road i loved it when marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the not so great ending would reccomend
i loved this story ! ! ! the action is fast paced and the romance sizzles ! buy this one a nd then buy a few copies for friends they will be glad you did ! !
i enjoyed this book very much i'm surprised that this one was n't made into a tv movie \( i e once in a lifetime , the ring , no greater love , fine things \) , but i still liked it deanna was very realistic she was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart , and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter , pilar , who died as a result of a motorcycle accident she met ben thompson and found fullfillment with him marc edouard was already having an affair with a woman named chantal i thought that he was a jerk for doing that to deanna but when it was all said and done and when i finished reading the book , deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was ben 's at last she could have a happy life with someone keep up the good work , danielle !
i really really hate that she uses the same names in a lot of her books it drives me insane she is always using , grace , liz , andrew but dont get me wrong , i love danielle steel 's books more that anything , but come one , can we just get a little insee weensee bit more creative and think of some different names for her books \? please \? im sure that other danielle steel readers will feel the same
this is the first danielle steele book i 've read and it will definitely not be my last i really enjoyed reading this book by the time i got to chapter 25 , i was wishing that i could read faster because i could n't wait to find out what was going to happen i was torn between 5 and 4 stars i chose 5 stars because it has been 2 weeks since i finished the book and i'm still thinking about it why i even entertained 4 stars is because the characters committed adultery from the very begining you can tell that this was going to happen and i did n't like that betrayal was involved as i continued to read the book , i fell in love with ben it took a while to like deanna because an affair is still an affair but i enventually started to feel for her overall , i recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story
whether you like sandy weil or not is not the issue here this is just a fascinating book and one of the best books i have read in a while you will not regret the time that you spend reading this
this book could be considered a corner stone foundation marker in understanding what makes people relevant , even when they are not
as a person used to work in wall street and live now in china , i read the chinese version of this book it was as if i lived , breathed , angered , and cheered with weill , dimon , prince one of the best books about wall street of past 10 years i ordered this book in english and will read it again , for at least once
the top business journalists in the world are the ones that research and pen the groundbreaking page a1 stories in the wall street journal the journal breaks these stories over and over again , and other news organizations simply trail in their wake monica langley is one of these trailblazers in 'tearing down the walls , ' she expands upon a lengthy page a1 profile she had written about sandy weill and details his horatio alger story
tearing down the walls charts the ascent of citigroup chairman sandy weill , from lowly brokerage clerk to master of a globe straddling financial empire what emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute but also seriously flawed
the author could have done much more with her subject many anecdotes in the book suggest sandy weill is a complex character for example , weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal , yet ridiculously lavish executive at one point he wo n't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work , yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet unfortunately she never addresses the question how can weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly \? other , similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest weill is a very complex individual but the author never treats him as such
this is a very good book very inspiring langley is successfull in making a very human sandy weill
monica langley follows sandford weill , a shy jewish boy from brooklyn , through his youthful struggles against adversity , his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success seen through the prism of weill 's tumultuous career , the financial world is small , despite its importance , internally more like a village than a city the book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class we recommended langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier 's career into such a compelling , well constructed narrative
i listened to this tape while i was recovering from a back injury the meditation uses guided visualization and deep breathing to help focus on whatever part of your body suffers from pain i found it very helpful it decreased my pain and helped me calm down in general i would recommend it to anyone with chronic pain or muscular injuries
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer , imho it has romance , treasure hunting , and a little magic really great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down i read it several years ago
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters , and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep sea diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed , maybe because i did not want it to end ! also , i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state , the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree , the blue green water , the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read , however i am an avid jd robb reader
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her , it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet , romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book , whether you like romance novels or not
first , let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books , more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read , her stories tend to be very formulaic , and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's , for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before , my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books , this one went against convention in many ways , while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship , but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain , but the love story was touching as other readers have said , i liked how she spread it out over the years , which made it slightly more realistic , and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short , if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan , give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered , but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men , and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream
this book is good , but not exactly what i wanted i received these books in excellent condition and in a timely fashion
this update is aces ! the added information on pregnancy lactation safety came just in time \( i had just started the l d rotation \) the quick look up feature is very helpful ! overall , this drug guide is a must for nursing students and licensed nurses
while working as an office rn i am often asked by a patient questions about the new medication they are on this book provides the answers it 's easy to read , each drug is broken into quick to find sections and it is very up to date do n't practice nursing without this book

this book is very helpful it has lots of drugs in it , and a lot of valuable info for planning patient care and ensuring there are no medication reactions
this excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital pda version of davis 's drug guide for nurses , the best drug guide which i have used
for the first time , i ordered my school texts on line to save money i am so pleased with the results shipment was fast , product was perfect and i saved money great for a forever student
you ca n't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide ! it is listed under generic names but if you do n't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name i had a nurse lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all this book delivered it all classification , pregnancy catagory , indications , mechanism of action , contraindications and precautions , adverse reactions and side effects , interactions , route and dosage , availability , nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses ! also implementation , patient family teaching and evaluation wow ! i 've been very impressed it came through for me so i did n't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something ! davis 's drug guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including recent drug approvals , additional drugs , combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that include class , indications , adverse reactions and side effects , route and dosage and contraindications and warnings appendix e is about natural herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book there are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites , formulas helpful for calculating doses , routine pediatric and adult immunizations , recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs , schedules of controlled substances , food sources for specific nutrients \( ie foods rich in k , na , ca , fe , vit k , vit d , low na , foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine \) , and insulin and insulin therapy also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past the organized , easily found references in this guide could save your client 's lives just because a doctor orders it does n't mean it is ok to give , as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all ! highly recommended ! good luck all future nurses !
the book i received was in good condition it had a minor crease on the cover were it had been opened overall i would buy from this seller again
i got this book when i started nursing school in 2003 this year \( fall 2005 \) as a senior , i wanted to get an updated drug guide , so i asked my adult ii instructor what she recommended , and purchased it it was from another company , and was in shrink wrap , so i did not look at it before i purchased the company is very reputable , but i found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as davis 's that was 35 down the tubes ! i would like to see a newer editon of davis 's that covers the many new drugs as soon as i do , i will purchase
bill rancic , the dashing winner of the first season of donald trump 's runaway hit reality show the apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book you 're hired how to succeed in business and life that he never went to business school and that he does n't believe that business theory can be learned from a book what then is the affable mr rancic doing offering advice on good and ethical business practices \? making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame , that 's what in two hundred pages , he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215 , 000 applicants to become the donald 's first `apprentice ' the reader is privy to mr rancic 's early entrepreneurial efforts , businesses that whet his appetite for something larger readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition through it all , rancic recounts the lessons he 's learned , persons he 's admired , falls from which he 's risen he offers opinions on kwame jackson , his fellow runner up to the apprentice title , and `deceitful' omarosa , whom many believed was the cause of jackson 's loss he also details lessons he 's learned on goals , values , strategies , leadership , vision , and success while business school grads may scoff at rancic 's straight shooting and simplistic advice , it is less idealistic than the one minute manager series of books here , rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams the result is one that is as memorable , yet as pleasing , as a tall glass of lemonade
this is not the type of book i usually read , but the persona that came through was so engaging that after flipping through a few pages , i decided to buy the book
while lots of books give you high level theories on how to succeed in your business , they usually leave you hanging at the end of the reading not know what actions to take in order to apply the theories in your day to day operation rancic 's book however has a step by step recount of how he did it with his cigar business you will get specific actions that you can do tomorrow to generate sales while other books give you general directions \( and lots of bullsh ts \) , rancic tells you specifically what he had done to succeed his business , what radio station he called , how much he paids for , what 's the account was , how much he charged
if you are looking for a book filled with tactics and ideas , this is not it move along if you are looking for an inspirational addition to your business collection , then this should be yours personally , i loved this book and read it in one sitting it profiles mr rancic , demonstrating the obstacles he has overturned on his road to success you 're hired shows what can be , and motivates one to achieve
from the moment i picked up this book and started reading it , i could not put it down ! literally thank goodness my toddler was still sleeping in the early morning hours , which allowed me to do so bill talks about how he was brought up and how is entreprenral mind was formed it was a very interesting and inspiring read if you are thinking about going into business for yourself , read this book it confirms the fact that if you do not go for it , it will never happen bill took his dreams and ideas and turned them into reality
i do n't so much mind the money i wasted on this book , it 's the time that bothers me bill rancic , you 're fired
i really do congratulate bill rancic for being hired by one of the richest man in the world but being hired does not mean that bill rancic just became the next bill gates or warren buffet
bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know the show was much better , you should buy that kwame is much smater and deserved the job i can tell that this book is another promotional tool do n't waste even a cent on this book
i really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series if you are a fan of dean koontz you will not be disappointed i give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in , but well worth the wait whew , what a ride
this character is a very unlikely hero a total geek , who is absolutley likeable the story fast paced and well written this was my first koontz book and it will not be my last i'm actually reading forever odd and that too is very good read this book
for me , this was one of starters of dean koontz 's books i really liked the book dean koontz is my favorite writers , cause of him i am doing my own book pick this one up , really good characters , main character , really good story , and plot
i did n't know what to expect before reading this book , but after reading it , i recommend it to any and everyone one of the best i 've read of koontz , and i 've read quite a few
kirk 's book is supposedly the bible of conservatives not neo conservatives , but conservatives he sets up the long standing debate between the french , and voltaie , and the english , using burke as it 's spokesman supposedly kirk would limit the vote , have a professional class of government officials , reduce if not eliminate most taxes , and let each individual strive for success this is the basic mantra of classical conservatives , and is all well and good as far as it goes , but only a few of the many ever succeed this way one of the surprises is how young kirk was when this book was written it 's as if he had some inspiration for on high \( probably not \) , or was cherry picking history \( probably closer to the truth \)
this book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking it is not very difficult to go online and read any number of conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day but , this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of conservative intellectuals often times it is portrayed \( not without some merit \) that conservatives are anti intellectual i have frequently heard that liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual but , the conservative mind blows a hole through all of that kirk examines major conservative thinkers like edmund burke , john adams , george canning , benjamin disraeli , john randolph of roanoke , orestes brownson , samuel taylor coleridge , john c calhoun , and t s eliot \( amung many many others \)
the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states , edmund burke , could he see our century , never would concede that a consumption society , so near suicide , is the end for which providence has prepared man but wait the conservative mind was first published in 1953 , the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell meanwhile , burke , a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times
probably most people reading this already know of this book 's reputation and influence , so i 'll skip over both the chapter by chapter analysis and the praise \( i 'd end up in what kirk would call overweening praise , anyway \) but i do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer the caricature to which i refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change in fact , the reviewer even argued that the soviet union could have been seen as a conservative system \( an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media \)
i found kirk 's work to be an excellant antidote to the religious right and neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as conservatism today a good place to take back the conservative philosophy , a philosophy of tolerance , respect , fairness , and progress , from the extremists bent on right wing christian tyranny
kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism among them
this was by far the most informational book i have ever read on conservatism i learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism also this book is very practicle and worthwhile no hype just fact and purpose anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking
what a charming story ! this book is a perfect quick read for an adult over a cup of hot cocoa or a great adventure for a young girl it beckons to those who enjoyed the secret garden or isle of the blue dolphins i would heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting a good clean adventure into an old fashioned fantasy world
this story is exactly what it is supposed to be a good story for kids i do n't seem to recall jk rowling saying anything about it having a single thing to do with harry potter she loved the book as a child had she said she loved green eggs and ham someone would inevitably launch into why the flying ford anglia was based on the blue car sam i am drove up a tree give it a chance and form your own opinion
i just found out about this book as an adult , read it and loved it i wish i had heard about it as a preteen or teenager it was exactly the type of book i read as a child while it does have magical elements , it is not full of harry potter magic if people are lead here by jk rowling 's comments it is more fanciful and mysterious , with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in a perfect escape from the real world for a bit it sounds like a movie is being made , which intrigues me i ca n't wait to see how it translates to the big screen altogether , it was an absolutely lovely book , one i am going to recommend to others to read 'tween , teen , or adult
after reading some negative reviews of this book , i needed to buy and read it myself i could n't believe that if the story was so bad , they would be making a movie of it
based on a storyline from the 1800 's , this book , in this day and age , is verging on child pornography , child neglect and promiscuous language i can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language , however , the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book , is treated as a child throughout , the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs some of the language used is so 1940 's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60 years some very good escapist scenes , however , it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned when there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from , why did movie makers choose this one
my mother read me this book nearly 30 years ago i remember being totally drawn in by the magic maria 's special room with the star ceiling , the big cat who turns out to be a lion so wonderful for a budding brain all children should read it
i recently purchased a new copy of this book i read it years ago , in 7th grade i enjoyed the book the second time and i'm glad i have it for my future children to read someday the story is a pretty heartwarming one everyone gets along pretty well and there really is n't too much unhappiness in it everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt this is mainly a story about learning to compromise i would recommend this book for children \( primarily girls , since the main character is a girl \) ages 10 13 younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them it 's a nice story for adults too , for the child within it 's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a dog , and the unicorn as just a little white horse i must say that i prefer the picture on the cover of the first book i read it was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn i think that one was much prettier than the current cover art
if blood and gore is your preference do not read this book it is a simple story with a touch of magic i first read it when i was about 12 and have been looking for it ever since it has joined my home library for neighborhood children and my grandchildren
i agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious , self indulgent , ego fest wallace is obviously highly intelligent , and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that
after literally stumbling across wallace 's brief interviews with hideous men , i immediately purchased broom of the system
i hate dfw i love dfw and so it goes this appears to be the tenor of the reviews as well as the general reaction that david foster wallaces writing seems to induce i became interested in reading the late 20th century greats and began with infinite jest one hundred pages later , i was sufficiently confused and decided to back off and read some early or shorter works by my authors of interest thus , i read delillo 's body artist and dfws broom of the system despite the fact that dfw is clearly more intelligent than me , i managed to finish the broom of the system it is more approachable than infinite jest , funny , and entertaining if you are new to dfw , i would say that this book has a similar feel as the films the royal tenenbaums or i heart huckabees is this a perfect book \? no is the writing outstanding \? yes but not completely perfected is the plot compelling \? no then the historian and davinci code are compelling but thats all they offer what is it that makes this book worth 4 stars \? it is simply dfws ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late 20th century he does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched it may be dfws lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated however , recall that the greatest american novel , moby dick was panned commercially and critically when first published was melville ahead of the collective curve \? probably is dfw also ahead of the curve \? given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing , it is not unlikely either way , the broom of the system offers an approachable starting point to one of the great writers of our time march onward , delillo , wallace , and pynchon
this novel provides an interesting angle for fans of david foster wallace a great book , but clearly the product of a fascinating and inventive writer who is still figuring out the true extent of his voice thus , while the book has many of the hallmarks of his writing \( the must describe everything of his subsequent works \) , it also has a kind of dare we say brevity , that is refreshing and works in the book 's favor while it stops short of the brilliance that followed , this is still a wonderful book , full of amazing characters , amazing situations , and is just plain an amazing read
there might be a good idea for a joke but it just does not come out funny that 's about all i can say about this amazingly overrated book seems to have all the ingredients to be good great ohio desert \( g o d \) funny , the names of the people funny , and so on came out to be just boring pretentious dull dialogue pretentious dull characters i was reading it in a morbid disbelief , that lasted for more than half of the book it is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once i passed the halfbook mark i usually want to know what happened it kept me going here for some more pages and then i decided nothing of it really happened , does not matter , waste of time none of the characters , surroundings or events were in any way interesting
one of the best non fiction books available on the subject of what is really happening in america recommended reading for those over the age of 18 thhat truly wants to understand what is happening to our country
with william cooper now dead killed in a shooting i feel it shows he was right trying to pass on this information he gave his life so we would know the truth
alot of folks love to criticize bill cooper i personally think he was reporting truths from his experiences information he got his hands on he claims right up front that some info may not be accurate he never claims to be 100 accurate , and gives you his sources for the info , not just opinions he took a stand to expose secret information he felt the public should know whether you agree with him or not , you 've got to respect the man he fought to get this book published ultimately lost his life holding on to that stand it 's risk takers like him that gives us knowledge information to see hidden truths thank you god bless you , bill rest in peace
this book is not for those who wish to continue living their monotonous and stressful lifestyles this is meant to make you aware and to further draw your own conclusions critical thinkers only ! !
it 's not too difficult to understand how behold a pale horse has become the best selling underground book of all time \( according to a blurb on one pro cooper website \) after all , people want to \( and do \) believe in outlandish things the problem with the late bill cooper 's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy , powerful men cooper believed this , cooper was a nut therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut , too rightly or wrongly , this is what people believe \( if you 're looking for a serious treatment of this subject , albeit from the pov of someone who thought it was a good thing , take a gander at carroll quigley 's monumental tragedy and hope \)
there is some who would say that bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below but i just think he she it is a liberal dupe there is also lots and i mean lots of conservative dupes i 'd say bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather to dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong there is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the federal reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts do your homework and you 'll see the crash of 29' was no accident the irs is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers now i do n't know about the illuminati or skull and bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected this book covers it all not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface this is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt , slime and worms are as for bill 's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this either way this book is a good and informative read
and every american should read this book then pass it on to bush his friends and family members
pay no attention to reviews about this book read and dicide for yourself what is going on in these 500 pages of mind boggling information you ca n't really take the book as proven fact , though , as cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book , himself
type cooper 's name into google and learn about what a nut job he really was he allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun a court issued an arrest warrant when two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them they returned fire , killing him
a friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right it is one of the most underrated books out there it 's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old the real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives one of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity buy it , read it and pass along to your friends and family
if you do n't have it then buy it everyone should own a copy
i recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life , and i'm grateful that i did it encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type , however it does n't leave anything out , while addressing each topic in a succinct way it is not new , and a few of the examples given will be dated that does n't lessen it 's messages in anyway
written around 50 years ago this book still holds true it is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success like most 'success' based books the concepts in here wo n't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple think success and gain success the belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success believing you can , will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons , it will find a how so you can achieve your goal conversely , if you believe you ca n't , your mind will find reasons to support your claim ,
this book has made a huge difference in the way i react , work , play and think about things that come up all the time the highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel
i am not sure i would have used the word magic in the title actually there is no magic in thinking big but the results of following the advice given by dr schwartz might seem like magic
refreshing audio , letting yourself be open minded and then relate and apply what you hare to your present situation this audio cd will is good for those people that are constantly on the go
this book is a classic just like napoleon hill 's think and grow rich the idea is basic and simple you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful it does not matter what degrees you have if you are not going to think about how to overcome your problems be it social , economical or whatever problem , you must take action as stated in this book action cures fear so , if you fear something then do something , and the fear is gone
i enjoyed this book very much the author was very clear about her research and the conclusions she reached it really helps explain the cultural setting of belly dance in egypt better than any other book i 've read , and it 's fascinating reading as well due to the little details she tells us about dancers living in egypt a must read book for those interested in egyptian belly dance
too many books about oriental belly middle eastern dance lean toward fantasy rather than scholarship van nieuwkerk 's book explores the seemingly paradoxical love hate relationship many people have toward egyptian belly dancing and dancers and details the history of the dance over the past few centuries
while probably not the best handicapping book even from the beyer set , this is one of the more entertaining handicapping books around you should read his earlier stuff first to see how he evolved as a handicapper to incorporate some ideas such as pace , trip , and form cycles , where earlier he had largely dismissed those where i spent a lot of time taking notes from other handicapping books , i spent more time turning pages and just enjoying a good read here
a very well written book easy to read , entertaining and full of useful information , this book makes otherwise complex theories easy to follow the use of anecdotes and real life examples allow for easier understanding of the ideas presented this is a useful addition to the library of any horseracing fan the serious student of horse racing handicapping should easily recover several times the price of the book from using the information presented that is a safe bet
andrew beyer is the godfather of speed figures in thoroughbred racing in preparing to bet the kentucky derby and other races this year i read andrew beyer 's fantastic book beyer on speed and joe cardello 's book speed to spare these two books fundamentally changed the way i handicap races it is simply careless to handicap races without understanding beyer speed ratings and use them to your advantage this book explains the origins of the beyer speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work i used the information on beyer on speed and speed to spare this year \( march , 2005 \) to hit a big trifecta at santa anita without beyer speed ratings and the information they provide , i would have never made the bet i made
this book is not for the beginning handicapper , but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book i have read most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks , but little knowledge is given to the reader beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper i wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days , then show you how they break down the races to make their selections , not with programs they want to sell it would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track , if they would bet it or pass it
reading andrew beyer is at once informative and entertaining , which anything on handicapping has no excuse not being while his first book introduced speed figures , and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping , this book revisits the holistic approach always emphasizing speed figures in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever , and many even know how to use it what makes reading beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see , vividly , the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches , in the stories one might call them lessons he recounts \( the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing \) beyer , like bill james , is a scientist , and thinks like one , to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides , and making the same old mistakes people like beyer and steve davidowitz are largely responsible for the ever escalating arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves it 's a wonderful game , but if you do n't want to get left behind , better read this
having never read a book by danielle steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels , i was looking forward to reading answered prayers , since i usually always find the books more deep and interesting sadly , i could n't have been more disappointed the first thing that bothered me about this novel , was the amount of repetition it has i was just through the first few pages of the first chapter , and i was already being told things \( usually insignificant \) which i had just read a few lines before
normally i do n't take the time to write a review , but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good , but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of 30 books that i paid 15 for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it
faith is a beautiful older woman that puts up with her husband 's coldness in their marriage just because she does n't realize what he 's doing to her she has two daughter 's ellie and zoe whom mean the world to her it 's not until she decides to go back to law school that her husband begins to treat her worst by the minute both of her daughters are no longer at home and it 's not until she meets up with a childhood friend brad that she begins to see what she could have coming back from a trip a day early she finds out that her husband has been unfaithful to her and she finds hope for her future in the childhood friend named brad whom happens to be married faith and brad get closer as time goes by and the rest is a fairytale come true in my opinion this book was one of d s 's best
read the first few chapters and the last few pages as usual , the remaining 300 pages were just repetition danielle steele should come up with a new formula \( as mentioned in previous reviews \) or tuck her pen away once and for all
wonderful yet so very sad at the same time i am a huge danielle steele fan this book , along with all her others are tops
the people in faith 's life are dying or moving away at her step father 's funeral , she sees an old friend she grew up with her brother 's best friend brad patterson they talk , exchange e mails and brad goes back to san fransisco
this book is very good gives an excellent description of a woman who is in a bad relationship and feels trapped interesting how she manages to wiggle free and start her life over again
this has to be one of the worst written books i ever read i ca n't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing so far , danielle steel has found a way in the first third of this book i just ca n't read the rest of it generally , if a book is n't very good i can suffer through this one has gotten on my last nerve i had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable but , i do n't think i will be reading anymore of her books it 's an insult to nora roberts and sandra brown for her to be ranked with them
this is the third edition of this book that i own as a dual diagnosis counselor i have found this book to be an invaluable resource the psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible i find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action
a primer of drug action is a nontechnical guide to the actions , uses and side effects of psychoactive drugs which will prove important for any psychology or health library collection a primer of drug action covers everything from herbal applications to clinical treatments of psychological disorders , revealing the latest findings in the applications of drug therapy to various conditions
i first read a friend 's copy of this book , which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course i soon acquired my own copy , and a number of my friends have read it it 's a very accessible introduction to mind affecting drugs , with generally good pointers into more specific literature julien 's strengths are in the area of legitimate , prescription use i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less complete the chapter on psychedelics is , unfortunately , nigh on useless errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book this book has been an indespensible reference for me
i became aware of this book because it was used as the textbook for a recent upper level biopsychology seminar it was one of the best books i have ever had to use for a class , and i believe is an extremely valuable reference for anyone with interest in the way drugs affect the brain the writing is clear , concise , informative , interesting , and complete each chapter gives an overview of the family of drugs and then goes into detail on a few of the most common examples everything from delivery to half life to molecular action to side effects is covered many of my friends went out and bought the book after looking at my copy to learn about either their recreational habits or prescription drugs a background in biology would be useful for understanding all of the information , but there are also appendices which explain the basics
this book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations there are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this however , after reading it , it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material i am sure that some of that is for effect but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring i still recommend it as a read , but i do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message
the information and the examples in the book are easily applied and really do make a difference i used the book as a reference working with first line managers it is especially useful to them in confronting passive aggressive communication styles
i kept thinking that this book was about business and would n't be applicabable to me , but boy was i wrong this is an amazingly insightful book that helped me in every area of my life , business and personal take susan scott 's advice and apply her suggestions to all areas of your life and you will be living at a much heightened level as she states it , it helps you come out from behind yourself and become real
i 've just come back to fierce conversations for about the tenth time scott has developed the clearest instructions on open , direct communication i 've seen in 20 years of working with clients around communication issues she gives easy to understand guidelines and supports each with excellent examples anyone who has been around long enough to have read the early texts on action science will appreciate scott 's ability to put complex concepts into understandable action this is a must read for anyone wishing to practice communication at its best
if you 've ever wondered about how to have a single conversation that will make a difference , this book will provide the guidance for that conversation scott is quite skilled at creating a simple approach to difficult situations
this is a worthwhile book for personal and leadership development it contains practical tools such as
i bought the book on cd , listened to it , and immediately listened to it a second time it contains invaluable information for self help , business and or leadership development practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions i assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation it was not , it was about encouraging \( and accepting \) honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact
susan scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all pretending not to know i was consistently impacted while reading it , not so much that the material is brand new , but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious
a must read a possible next target for the us or israel \( check today 's news \) let 's
scott ritter and seymour hersh have made at least two appearances at the new york society for ethical culture in the past year to discuss us foreign policy issues concerning iraq and more recently iran the october 16 , 2006 appearance covered the issues of mr ritter 's current book target iran transcripts and podcasts are available
scott ritter provides chapter and verse on how conflict with the axis of evil nations could have been avoided with direct negotiation the mullahs of iran sought to negotiate with everything on the table , including nuclear weapons and a treaty with israel north korea still wants direct negotiations so did saddam we do n't negotiate with regimes we want to remove bush prefers to take them out no matter how many americans die
this could have been one of the most important books of the year scott ritter provides important , but tangential , information related to israel 's influence over u s foreign policy , the history of the iaea in iran , and the theory of regime change as the real reason for u s concern over iran 's nuclear weapons infrastructure
first published in 1999 , and its still going selling strong ! this manual has a lot going for it
this book is the best book on ashtanga yoga on the market a must have for any person interested in ashtanga yoga it covers all aspects , showing easier versions of the poses so that the beginner can also follow it
this was recommended to me by my ashtanga teacher it has great photos and really complements what you hear in class i understand more the drishti \( eye gazes \) and what the modifications to the poses are when i think about it , i open it up and read about a particular pose that i am having some trouble with it 's really nice to have around
this book is a fantastic guide for your ashtanga yoga i would recommend reading yoga mala \( pattabhi jois \) first , and then using this book as a guide for your practice illustrations are clear , vivid and easy to follow the binding of the book allows for propping while praticing david swenson does a fantastic walking through step by step how to get into each pose i use it everyday
do you look like this person on the cover \? if not , you may want to rethink this book i got it as a gift but plan on regifting it soon it makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people interesting asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it , but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life , not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young indian boys for a different view , take a look at the yoga of heart by mark whitwell
david swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal ashtanga practice i have been doing ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by david 's primary series dvd and this book since i first began my practice
as an ashtanga enthusiast , i am always on the look out for new things to add to my collection my first ashtanga teacher made copies of this book for me years ago , and i loved those few pages now that i have bought the entire book , i see just how wonderful it really is ! it explains each posture in both the primary and intermediate series in simple to understand language plus , david swenson includes various modifications for difficult poses , which is always helpful
i 've reviewed most ashtanga books out there , and this is by far the best ! ! ! the fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or teacher i really like how mr swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that ca n't stretch like gumby highly recommended
this is an excellent look at ashtanga yoga swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at yoga standing series and finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich , with the primary series as the filling in the sandwich and the idea of a vinyasa as the etch a sketch which clears the slate for each new asana , and his physics of flight and ground transportation as a means to jumping forward my only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page it would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down also , \( ok , i have one more wish \) i appreciated the break down of the sanskrit word into meanings , but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too otherwise , it is nearly perfect
this book is a classic and david swenson is well loved by the yoga community i 'll admit that i find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes \( david did the design and layout himself \) but , you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import overall , i find david 's voice friendly , supportive and unassuming he does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students this book covers a lot of information , including primary series and intermediate series
alterman tries to deny the obvious left wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments for one , he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities in actuality , at one time , minorities were in fact seldom shown on tv , and then almost always in negative , stereotyped roles \( e g , black maids , asian coolies \) but those times have changed not so with the liberal bias in fact , i sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child , long before i knew what a liberal even was i saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in vietnam , while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the communists at that time , i wondered why now i know
to hinkle goldfarb 's review , i would like to add several observations
even for the already converted , this is a great book normally i'm not too sympathetic to lefty books that will cleary be read by a number of conservatives that you could count on your hands and maybe one foot but even the choir will find this a well researched , even tempered , fair assessment of the liberal media myth and best of all , the american public comes off looking like a culprit as much as a victim ultimately , people vote with their eyes , ears , and wallets if the public demands and devours media slop , then that 's what they 'll get and , to a large extent , deserve
if mr alterman just watched a nightly news cast of cnn , which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality , then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web , tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like mcdonalds fast food , however those who know better , avoid it because it can be damaging to one 's mental health , but then again mr alterman just wrote this book for the money , even if he makes a fool of himself doing it
as a student at oklahoma state university , i am very interested in journalism and broadcasting eric alterman 's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media the purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media after reading through the book , i came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than i look at it i recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media
other reviewers have pointed out the errors eric alterman makes in this book , like saying that the u s was under the kyoto protocol that was particularly annoying he needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins
after having lived in nyc for 12 years , i finally read this book it had been recommended as a must read for anyone who had ever lived in the city many reviewers commented on the leisurely pace of the story , and i agree the description of the event in the climax of the story , though , i found too long and almost unbearably tedious , especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book the time travel part was especially troubling to me i was n't at all convinced of its process however , i still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending as many have said , stick with it
this book was on my summer reading list , and i was thinking that it
others have summarized i 'll add that this novel is one of the best i 've read slow starting , but stick with it read the sequel also try to find the third level , one of finney 's lesser known short stories \( also about time travel nyc \)
the descriptions of 1882 new york smack of reality more than anything i have ever read the reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel i have ever read truly amazingly authentic the tale starts out slowly , but brings the reader to an awesome action packed , never rushed conclusion extremely satisfying a beautiful , thought provoking story there is everything here , science fiction , mystery , action , philosophy , and a bit of romance highly recommended
i bought this book in 1970 when i had just started college it is one of the few books i have kept for all these years and have re read regularly the premise for the story is a young man , si morley , who joins a government program to go back in time to the ny of 1880 's the past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story not only is it entertaining , containing romance and mystery , but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today
while i enjoyed reading the first half of this book , the second was pure agony i actually started to skim through most of the pages until i reached the end it is dense with detail almost too dense for instance , finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire his descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages , but by page 10 of the fire , i was completely and totally bored now , i'm not saying fiction should always be a quick , easy read quite the contrary i found finney 's writing to be refreshing but c'mon folks , this book should have been 100 150 pages shorter \( strictly for over the top romance lovers \)
a quantum leap of reading how his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable , and personal , story around each one is an amazing feat i found myself wondering if he did travel back in time was it possible could i do it \? i even tried the self hypnosis he told about picking the civil war as my target no did n't work for me yet ! would i love to do it ! the ending of this book shook me he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way it 's amazing read the mirror , read diana gabaldon 's time travel series but please do n't miss including this book as your number one , best dog eared copy of your library you wo n't be sorry
this book starts out slow , but once you get past the first few chapters you wo n't be able to put it down if you know anything about new york , you will find it fascinating i'm not sure if it would be as appealing to someone who has never been to new york but the story is good regardless
the sense of actually being in the mid 1800 's was so strong , that i felt i had to decompress to bring myself back to my own time and i did so very reluctantly a wonderful story with amazing images ! highly recommended
i love o'reilly
my husband brought this home , and reading some of it , it reflects some very common sense realities about politics , along with some fairly harsh criticisms of many of the players associated with campaigns and elections a long time boston resident and close to the action in most cases , the author exhibits an uncommon knowledge of more than a few events and cautions the readers to try and look beyond the momentary hype to assess the value and the progress of our american political campaigns to see who really winds up on top , and too often , who really winds up on the bottom , and often screwed a highly informative read , and one that appeals to logic as the ruler by which american democracy is played out , and its relation to ordinary citizens
i find bill 's books to be easy reads , which is important if he wants to reach a diverse audience this book is a great motivator for personal growth i finished it feeling much like i did after reading the o'reilly factor i wanted to improve myself and my life
if you are a fan of o'reilly and are interested in his personal anecdotes and their place in his life 's journey , then you 'll enjoy this book do n't expect any startling revelations , but do expect a good dose of common sense and a challenge to apply it in your own life
thought the book was great and factual certainly worth the time and money
i'm like many of the statistical women described in the book who found themselves living well while married and then found themselves divorced and broke with little to show for years of sacrifice and hard work it was then i discovered how dependent i had become on someone else to provide for my financial future i call it marital welfare and i do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands kim kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart it was the you 're on the right track message that i needed to hear to further my resolve not just in finances but in every area where self sufficiency needs to evolve the good news is that i am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans , goals and dreams and shares in the excitement this book does not give a step by step how to , but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you view your life for many people , that 's all it takes , and in that regard , this book has accomplished wonders

this was not the book i expected it to be , but it has won me over kim is n't saying that the mechanics of investing are different for women , but the motivations , rewards and value of investing groups are that 's why there 's so many references to rich dad , poor dad etc go there to learn more about pure investing
rich woman is great for women who are just beginning to take control of their financial future and step out into the world of investing
kim shows how investing for women can be very real and her approach is down to earth she triggers thoughts with stories and examples shows the reader that no matter where you are at in life you can do this
i thought this book was great for my first book on investing my husband and i are getting ready to invest in our first property and i wanted to be a part of our investments so i am starting with educating myself this book was really inspirational and motivating which helps when taking a risk it shows that anyone can invest no matter what income you have to start with i would highly suggest reading this book if investing is something your thinking of doing i hope you enjoy !
do n't waste your time with rich woman just read rich dad poor dad the book rich woman is nothing but a advertisement for their books and seminars f
90 of this book is about kim and her husband and how they got to where they are there is very little information on how to actually go about investing she 's a good cheerleader , not so good on passing along good advice
rich women is a great book for men ! men , buy this book for the women in your life women have the potential to be excellent business people and with training and practice can beat men at their own game most have a subtle advantage over men and do n't have to deal with the big ego problems of having to , know it all they just want to be winners and successful many just do n't know where to start or how to get help rich women is a great start and savvy guide to financial freedom written for women
this is a good read this is what happens when you work hard at something and belive in yourself , just like tavis has
i am white , grew up in a small ohio town with no blacks , went in the marine corp , my first exposure to the black community you might say then spent a couple decades in corporate america as our country has moved along from the sixties and the appropriate black activities of the time i have to say this book is a pleasent surprise it has no big discussion on the whites that cause all their problems , it is just a downright honest book about one life lived well sometimes tavis arrogance comes through and i imagine there are those along the way that would have some say about that but it doesnt matter this book outlines a black success story against incredible odds but more importantly it is an american success story you can all learn alot about growing up black and growing up impoverished in america as i did from this more importantly tavis outlines how we can forgive and love one another which is most important
tavis is a man that puts god first and he has never made him last the book is truly remarkable just when i thought he had reached his highest potential , here he goes again just like the man , the book intrigues the mind to think outside of the box he tells of his strengths his weaknesses , his successes , his failures and each lesson that was learned along the way keep it coming tavis , keep intriguing the mind to think this is story about how he became the man he is today ! i just gave my teenage son the book and i will be purchasing copies for each of the young men in my family
the most creative power given to the human spirit is the power to
after i read sen obama 's book , i chanced to check out what other black writers were writing
what i know for sure is that tavis smiley 's testimony and transparency through this book was a refreshing read he is a prolific speaker and a voice for this generation i applaud him for allowing us to share intimately into his life i was deeply moved by his honesty in retelling the experiences that shaped the man we now see today the candidness expressed in each chapter allowed us to witness the forces that birth his purpose and propelled his drive , ambition , and advocacy his love for people was greatly evident this book is a must read not just for african americans but for anyone who has faced adversity , challenges and trying circumstances in life greatly inspiring
who is tavis smiley \? initially tavis' prominence in the media led me to think this guy was just a 'talking head' a person simply trying to find a means to move up in this world however , years have shown me i was wrong
i 've always dug respected tavis smiley big time i 've always respected his vast knowledge ability to communicate be direct just do his thing this book takes you back to his upbringing this book pulls no punches about what he dealt with as a young black man growing up in a household of a large family , also dealing with getting whippings \( this was the pre pre time out era which back in the day only applied to sports games \) and dealing with his own self in the process everybody sees hears the success , but not many people are aware of the struggle this man had to endure the many lasting images things he had to deal with mentally i applad brother tavis smiley for not being afraid to settting the record straight this book will hit you in so many ways depending on your own upbringing it might be close to your own story i can relate to it big time tavis does n't back down to bet or npr either tavis without a doubt is one of the most important voices out here he keeps it real this book is very direct real

if you 've read any of the reviews , you 'll already know how influential this book has been for decades now i was fortunate enough to first read it when i discovered a 3rd edition original printing at a budget bookstore what a find !
i just finished think and grow rich for the 3rd time the first time i read it , i was a twenty something and did n't fully grasp it the next time i read it , i was a forty something , and i reaped great benefits by implementing these principles into my life and career now , i am almost sixty , and i finally understand the book napoleon hill was clearly correct when he stated that it is very seldom that a young person can grasp the master keys to riches after completing this book for the third time , i am looking forward to an even more satisfying and productive future i highly recommend this book to those who want to find the keys to success and riches as well as peace of mind there should be a college curriculum built around this book in today 's u s society , the concepts of self determination and individualism are dying concepts this book will teach you how to use your mind to achieve anything that you desire everyone desiring success and riches should read this book please do not take offense to the masculine references contained in the book it should be remembered that this book was completed almost 70 years ago and society was different it 's principles apply to both genders and all races and ethnic groups
whatever the mind can conceive and believe , the mind can achieve
i have had the isbn 0449214923 version of this book for a number of years and as it has travelled many miles it 's got rather tatty
i have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that i have read to make the material come to life after reading think grow rich and after reading so many positive reviews here , i decided to go out and buy this one as well to tell you the truth , it was sort of anticlimatic the exercises were good , but i pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide
i am a huge fan of napolean hill and this book in particular this book is think grow rich plus an action guide when i first read the book think grow rich , i got great results but when i used this book with the action guide , my results were greatly magnified
seems that anyone who 's anyone worth knowing has read this old classic that usually sets me off i do n't like being mainstream
the think grow rich action pack is a phenomenal book that will help you to reach your maximum potential , achieve your goals , build your character and develop your leadership skills the think grow rich action pack is a great guide on how to personalize think grow rich to your walk in life i discovered think and grow rich when i read former heavyweight boxing champion and international boxing hall of famer ken norton 's autobiography going the distance norton shared in his book that he read think grow rich and it changed his life norton 's book states he was prescribed to read think grow rich after he suffered his first boxing defeat and had to start over he then went on to beat muhammed ali for the title norton shares in his book that he read think grow rich repeatedly during his career and he became a stonger person for it
i still have my original copy it 's very tattered and worn after the 100s of hours of reading and re reading , but it remains an important part of my life this book has had the most significant impact on my life than any other book i 've read \( not including the bible \)
after graduating from college i questioned my education i guess i was n't happy with the path that i chose too bad that i realized that right after i graduated , however just by chance i read michael gerber 's the e myth revisited the book completely geared me towards a different goal instead of going into education i decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business that 's when i decided to research books about success and what it takes i stumbled upon think and grow rich , i read all the reviews on amazon com , and instead of buying the book i decided to rent a copy from the library i took few days to read it right after i finished reading it , i decided to purchase my own copy it was possibly the most important decision i 've made in my life i 'd like to claim that the book changed my life , in addition i read several other books written by napoleon hill , og mandino , zig ziglar , jeff keller and many more however , i found that think and grow rich served as a template to everyone else 's work napoleon hill presented his discoveries quite clearly , and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone 's life ever since then , i 've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of st louis i'm proud to say that i could n't have done it without the help of napoleon hill and his book think and grow rich this book was not only written to get rich , but also to change people in a positive way whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete , this book will definitely help you achieve any goals like napoleon hill said , whatever your mind can conceive and believe , it can achieve , these are the words to live by ! this book should be your starting point towards life 's riches , you can then follow up by reading napoleon hill 's other books , as well as books written by other authors on the same topic
i am a personal growth coach and i do some work in the area of sexuality there are many people that are inhibited around their fantasies or feel guilt for having normal sexual feelings i feel this book is useful because it provides a wide array of different types of fantasies that are common in themes in the female population this can be a very helpful book to help people normalize their feelings of shame and guilt around their innocent fantasies
if we can get beyond the fact that all of us guys get super turned on by this and love to read these fantasies , then we can objectively take a look at this book
i found this book on a shelf at a library over 10 years ago it was a hardcover book and the artwork was rather nondescript what i browsed through within though is seared into my conscience and really opened my eyes to the world of female lust thought i admit , nothing has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside even hardcore it 's all about intent , motive , desire is it real \? is it sincere \? you could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem less than perfect looks wise it almost always is the look in her eye , or the pitch of her voice , something that conveys warmth , you know \? more than anything , seeing and feeling a palpable hunger , an aching so deep it hurts for satisfaction i found a lot of that energy in this book and it was divine i wish ms friday would release another compilation of this material
let 's be straight this is a book full of real people 's sexual fantasies it 's not guided by some moral code the world imposes on us , nor is it subject to the same code when being read it is individual 's fantasies escapism , exploration of the mind where boundaries have no place the reader is supposed to have reactions evoked , because some of what happens within a world of fantasy is so outside the real worlds acceptability that when looked at form the real world , it seems alien , and stimulates our ingrained sense of right or wrong it gives an insight into the women who 've contributed psyche , often how women as sexual beings have been repressed by the world around them , and unable or unwilling because of their confines to rebel in the real world , have conjured in their minds elaborate and amazing ways to escape mentally , which in turn , has enabled the conscious self to accept who they are , and apply their own morals and values to their lives , rather than ones given to them by their parents and religions and upbringing ! an uplifting book for those who are n't afraid to explore themselves
i read this as a relatively young woman , and lord did it make an impression on me it features many passages endorsing beastiality , something i find morally reprehensible if you agree , then bingo ! you now know to steer clear of this garbarge i'm not an advocate of book burning , but i would n't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire
these three works are wonderful in themselves , and fascinating in their anticipations of crowley 's visionary masterpiece and one of american fiction 's handful of true masterpieces little , big \( 1981 \)
again i bought this book because of the outstanding reviews and am sadly disappointed this is junk not one of the three stories is entertaining the only positive i can say is that it has a similar feel to gene wolfe but that is like saying an ant is similar to a man because it has legs , so just forget it , this blows
crowley has made a career of being one of the most underrated masters of american fiction only one book , little , big , has ever been a modestly big seller his aegypt tetrology , not yet complete , is a piece of visionary work on an epic scale his only fault is that the writing is unclassifiable , so it has fallen between every conceivable crack bad for sales
john crowley is a treasure he combines gorgeous , haunting writing with a wealth of intelligent , thought provoking ideas otherwise collects his three early novels , all nominally science fiction but so far from the stereotypical forms of that genre as to almost deserve their own literary classification in each of these small but perfectly formed jewels , crowley demonstrates complete control of his medium in barely 200 pages , he creates and destroys worlds , makes us fall in love with his characters , and leaves us wanting more
i really am finding this book to be chocked full of valuable information on gettings ones art career in motion i recommend this one for anyone thinking of moving past the hobby stage of their career
wow , wow , wow get this book ! this has \( just about \) everything you need to be professional the only thing i did n't like is that most of the resources listed were geared to nyc residents , but there was good direction as to how to locate similar services in your area i especially liked the opening that deals with how artists are helping to perpetuate their own starving artist myth , and the ways to stop that it made me realize that i am the one standing in the way of my own success ! well , no more thanks to caroll i am taking all of the steps listed i wish my graduate school had this information available
this book was really helpful in understanding how much marketing work is involved with doing art it 's a little intimidating to think that you will need to write press releases for everything you do but thats' the truth i guess if you want to play the game that is if you want to play by and set your own rules instead of just being a tool for the whims of gallerists and dealers
i have never been one to read self help books , but , as an artist just beginning to market my work , i felt helpless and uninformed i am so glad i bought this book ms michels demystifies the business process in a pragmatic and often humorous way i now feel i have a clearer picture of where i'm going and how i'm going to get there , as well as having more confidence in myself and less awe of the art world
i thought this book was helpful in how to write a cover letter and a resume i have n't read the whole book yet but so far it 's decent
this is an absolutely essential book for all artists with all of the nuts and bolts information you need to prceed with art as your full time career the authors attitudes and insights into the myth o f the artist are nothing less than inspiring
book came on time in good condition
everything was fine it arrived very soon
this book is a great basic book for entry into the art business it has alot of good reference materials in the back and good advice
for an artist who is serious about selling my work and making money , caroll 's accumulation of contacts , facts , sources and a collection of years of experience is helping my work enhancement and marketing expertise
one could right an honest right wing history , i suppose , by sticking to the facts paul johnson 's propaganda is simply lying as just one instance of this , paul johnson assures the reader that president johnson was reluctant to escalate the vietnam war he further assures us there is no evidence , as was later alleged , that the incident was contrived , to get america deeper into the war and further but congress , by an overwhelming majority , passed the tonkin gulf resolution' authoring the president to take vigorous measure to protect us forces one would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the pentagon papers so explicitly state that the official account of the tonkin gulf attack was a deliberate deception in the october harper's article , the next war , daniel ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers , memos , estimates , and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the johnson administration for a wider war , expected to commence soon after the election though far more inclined to trust ellsberg than johnson , either paul or lyndon , i admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth , but i have not heard that the pentagon papers were not genuine
in this work , paul johnson gives a historical overview of the 20th century , from the 1900 's to the 1980 's
an extremely entertaining and readable book a pleasing eye for the small detail , an efficent prose style he has extreme selective memory the spanish civil war or castro 's cuban revolution with no mention of crushing poverty just one example in some cases he 's flat out wrong cuba a 'rich country' under batista his dismisal of ghandi smacks of racism in general he has come to praise the colonialist english , vichy france , franco and nixon to savage fdr , jfk and labor unions
paul johnson is opinionated and a good writer and this history is very readable national review named it one of the top 100 books of the century and , although i'm not a political conservative , i found myself in agreement with much of what johnson says
this is how history should be written the author thesis that ism has been the monkey on mans back for the most of the 20th century is steel on target this book has a lot for one to ponder on

i'm trying to read all of mr johnson 's books , because this one was so good some are not available modern times is a sweeping history of the 20th century that should be read by students everywhere armed with the facts , they 'd be less prone to falling for historical lunacy later on
i was given this book by a friend i am here on amazon to buy 8 copies to give to acquaintances i know will enjoy it as much as i did it 's amazingly thought provoking and apparently controversial , i had to write a review after i read the one that gave the book a low rating , though the reviewer admittedly had n't read it there 's a reference to folks like that around page 750 referring to wayward 'intellectuals' at smith and stanford
accurate history is always difficult for reasons that are obvious to anyone that has ever tried to either study it or write about it paul johnson has blended a good balance between presenting the complexities of 20th century history with the relatively simple cause and effect relationship between certain leaders , movements , and policies and their results on the peoples of the world
night is a frightening book written by a man who saw the horrors of the holocaust firsthand elie wiesel survived years of torture , malnourishment , and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of nazi control he was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again he watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium
what an honest author he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share
beyond and essential read , night speaks to the reader about fundamental questions at the heart of the human condition a powerfully moving autobiography , the story of this teenager 's journey through the most horrific death camps of nazi europe , strips away discussion of anti semitism and hatred , to present the raw suffering of individual humans , stuck in situations beyond their control from the establishment of a ghetto in elie 's home town of sighet , the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the holocaust auschwitz , buchenwald , gleiwitz some of the most infamous places in modern human history , rise around elie , as we watch him stripped of absolutely everything the reader is swept along helplessly , as hitler 's final solution unfolds death marches , starvation , selections , cattle carts full of people , torture , floggings , mass murder and as elie is gradually reduced to nothing more than a 'hungry stomach'
this is a disturbing work in that it recounts a man 's experience of the nazi death camps warning this book will shake you up mentally , and emotionally it is not for the faint of heart yet , it is a must read because of the exposure it gives to humanity at it 's worst and humanity under it 's worst
the short novel night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter , but because elie wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character generally considered autobiographical , the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only god , but his humanity as the nazi machine ravages europe the novel itself deserves 10 stars
no matter your religion , ethnicity or basic beliefs , everyone should read this book because it is about hamanity and how it can change from mundane to total hell for no reason
what more can be said which already has n't of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage \? with 900 reviews , i will not make this an overly elaborate review , as the book simply does not require it elie wiesel 's story is one of one man 's courage , will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost friends , family , belongings , even basic human dignity
night is wiesel 's personal memoir , which relates his personal story before and during world war ii , as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps
i always wonder what makes a book a good story to nominate for a pulitzer prize \? even though i knew night was about the holocaust i still wondered what would make this book a winner
i read michael masterson 's earlytorise e zine at least once a week , more when i have time so i thought i had a pretty good idea of what to expect from power persuasion and it did n't disappoint without knowing a lot about masterson 's specific career path , i can guess that he 's had a great number of successes in a number of different fields i say that because the ideas and principles that he presents for persuading others seem to transend specific job situations , so i can only assume that he 's used them within any business situation in which he 's found himself obviously , if you have the ability to persuade others , you 'll have a great source of power at your fingertips having never been one to try to browbeat anyone into taking my side in a discussion , i look forward to putting the more subtle aspects of masterson 's persuasion techniques to work for me it 'll be interesting to see where i am career wise , in a year 's time , to see if i have indeed been able to leapfrog up the corporate ladder putting masterson 's power and persuasion to work for me
michael masterson is one of my favorite writers his book power and persuasion hits the nail on the head when he describes the characteristics of successful business leaders \( especially in chapter five \) he puts into words what i have learned and believed for years i found his thoughts about establishing communication routines and following up on goals to be on target too many leaders try to micromanage their employees and business associates his comments about true delegation and recognizing different expectations of individuals increase both the leader 's power and the power of those they associate it takes very little time to acknowledge someone 's accomplishments while increasing that person 's self worth the result is a strong business team of course a regular routine of firing the weakest performers is best when needed pruning your hierarchy usually strenthens your business and hopefully , those individuals will learn from the experience and succeed in another business it is impossible to be liked by everyone , but strong leaders are usually respected power and persuasion is a must read ! ! ! buy it now ! ! ! i know several leaders who will receive michael masterson 's book as gifts some who already have these skills and some who should learn and practice these successful business traits
i did notice two typos , and i'm deducting a star for that , but the book was good an energizing , informative series of essays on leadership and communication in business and also in personal matters
while i have not finished the entire book , i find it ironic that in a book on success and accomplishment there are at least 1 or 2 typographical errors in each chapter while the business concepts appear sound , i am concerned about the lack of editing that apparently went into this book i have also read automatic wealth by this author and there were few if any typos
i expected a well written book from masterson , and was not disappointed
michael masterson is a money making genius and the ideas he presented in automatic wealth have changed my life as soon as i heard about the release of power and persusion i ran out and grabbed a copy and was not disappointed
michael masterson has had success in many businesses one of them which i am part of so i can tell you first hand how his leadership has had a profound impact on my business and personal life and he has close to 400 , 000 early to rise readers who would probably agree if your looking for a leadership book written by silver spoon ceo 's who have never built a business from the gorund up , do n't buy this book however if you want actionable leadership advice that you can use in your everyday life , masterson is the one who can teach you
in the five years i 've been following michael masterson 's advice , my business has gone from an idea to an 8 million endeavor with 25 , 000 customers world wide 18 loyal , hard working employees who surpass every challenge i give them and a very healthy bottom line
this author was recommended to me by a breeder who competes with his dogs in hunting trials the breeder is a firm believer in gentle methods and a trusting relationship however , before i ordered the book , i read reviews of mr wolters other books on amazon and was prepared for the worst old fashioned , fear based , compulsion methods i was wonderfully surprised !
a new approach which in fact is so easy but psychologically so difficult to accept we have tried it out and and observed companies doing it since 16 years to design and market low end products for the bottom of the pyramid \( bop \) with high profit margins at low cost we have developed a tool which we call mmp or multiple market positioning which shows step by step how to implement this bop idea successfully regards , dr peter oertli , oec oertli consulting , ch 8142 uitikon zurich , switzerland
tons of information backed by practical means there is a ton of contemporary and useful information , statistics , charts , and analysis in this book equally important are the lists
on the one hand this book is endorsed by microsoft 's bill gates and former secretary of state madeleine albright that ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value on the other hand , it might be asked , what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth \? after all , the poorest people that have any disposable income at all make something like two dollars a day
as prahalad explains in his preface , he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80 of humanity his approach would mobilize the resources , scale , and scope of multinational corporations \( mncs \) their investment capacity in a co creative partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations \( ngos \) in order to formulate and then implement unique solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than 2 a day at the bottom of the pyramid to which the book 's title refers the process must start with respect for bottom of pyramid consumers as individuals the process of co creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problem solvers new and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned that is a challenge
what is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth , improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models , distribution channels , product development or business processes having grown up and worked in india in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued
this is a well researched book in which prahalad explores how disruptive innovation if harnessed properly can lead to huge profits for the corporations involved and high impact social well being the key however is to get the ground breaking idea there is no set approach to getting the same , but he has done a good job of explaining how the idea can be scaled
this is a fantastic book ! 112 pages of theory and advice that really makes sense you easily internalize the message ! this is then followed by 5 very thorough and down to the detailed examples of how the theory has been practised by fore running companies in the field of 3rd world integration it is very illustrative and initiate thoughts on how this could be followed up in your own compan
this is the intense , profound , almost unbearably sad story of swede levov , brought to life in the audio version by a mind blowing performance by ron silver
the first three quarters of this novel are absolutely captivating and unputdowanably good and yet just when i thought it was about to get even better , roth shifts gears and peels away another layer of the onion to show us these people and their friends and family through the main character 's eyes while eventually the story picks up again , this radical shift took away some of the enjoyment for me
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
i just finished reading american pastoral , my first book by philip roth since it is my first roth , i think i provide an unbiased perspective i know he has written some other stuff , but my mind has not yet been corrupted by it ok , so what is my opinion of american pastoral \?
i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede , without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration
i am not a fan of using the same protagonist in many novels i tend to think that it 's a result either of laziness on the part of the author \( the protagonist being so close to his own voice that to strike out with another character would be too difficult \) or the desire to cash in on the success of previous novels with the same character i put those issues aside to read this book anyway and i was very happy that i did thankfully , there was no need to be familiar with the other books the details in this book of the politics of zuckerman 's youth , the glove factory , and the anguish at losing his daughter to the world make this a great novel i have a terrible memory for the characters and events of stories , but this one remains with me i 've added several other of roth 's book to my future reading list
this astonishingly insightful tragedy shows the unreliable outcome that can stem from almost any \( \? all \) of our american contemporary civil virtues , demonstrating that outcomes ca n't be predicted from input
i had my doubts about this book i am a professional dog trainer , and a animal behaviorist i would not recommened this book for your average reader however it covers the basics of canine behavior very well and i would recommend it to anyone who trains dogs , or works with groups of dogs and wants a deeper understanding of their social interactions
i doubt that some of the examples were true to life some dogs were at first presented as knowing as much as a 3 year old human child these dogs were presented as responding to long sentences and did things that dogs just cannot do then the book analysed these impossible canine responses and i do not accept the book 's analysis these fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts
i do n't agree with all that he says , but it is all interesting lots of information to integrate with practical learning
i have a special needs dog and i have been searching for a book that will give me practical ways to work with her this book has given me a lot of helpful information without reiterating the obvious great find !
while i ca n't pretend to have gotten inside the mind of stanley coren , i am willing to speculate that he wrote this book as a way of taking a very specific scientific controversy out of the realm of academia and bringing it to the people the controversy do dogs have a true language or do they not \?
this book was not only full of information , it was fun to read also ! ! it gave alot of the background of todays canine which is important to know in order to understand what your dog is saying wonderful book ! ! i recommend it to anyone who has a dog or wants a dog or just likes learning about dogs !
as a lover of dogs for over 50 years , i own dozens of books about canine care and behavior , but stanley coren 's 'how to speak dog' is definitely my favorite i originally found this informative dog communication book in my local library after adopting a lovable but fearful mixed breed from my local humane society five years ago since then , i have bought at least six copies of this same book online , just to have on hand to give to friends and family who decide to bring a dog into their life or who do n't understand the behavior of a dog already living with them i especially like the book 's detailed descriptions of a dog 's specific body language \( ears , eyes , mouth , tail \) and what each means as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way not unlike a driver 's training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers , 'how to speak dog should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog
very good book very informative easy to read and easy to learn from i would recommend this for anyone working with dogs in any capacity and for those who just want to have better comunication with their dog

very well written it connected a lot of dots for both my wife myself , bringing better understanding about us as well as our dog friends we 've always believed that when you train your dog you also are training yourself we have loved all of our 'friends' that have shared their lives with us are just now beginning a new bond with our third dalmatian puppy anyone that has had any experience around this breed knows the special aura they wear this book is a 'must read' for you
i'm new at reading about energy healing modalities , so i have little to compare it to i found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about healing touch and how to be a practitioner it has some wonderful stories , some that even made me cry i still have a long way to go to make this work for me , but it 's the beginning of a new awareness in my life
this devotional is well rounded , and very complete for day to day study you can take a half hour or as long as you desire and it is truly food for your soul i look forward to my devotional time and am so excited by the growth this book encourages
i suggest this prayer guide to anyone who is trying to mature in their christian faith it is simple to use and straight forward in design focused weekly topics that are supported by scripture in each daily reading being in the word daily is the best way to grow close to jesus christ , the son , our god would make a great gift too for someone you love
this guide to prayer is just one more in the continuing line of beneficial products offered by upper room publishing many people look for ways to deepen their time spent in spiritual growth and development too often we focus so heavily on ourselves that we forget the contributions of the past the guide to prayer series offers insights that have been gleened from the spiritual practices of the church throughout the centuries the format is simple and concise taking the reader on a journey of daily worship including invocational prayer , spiritual readings , scripture , meditation , prayers , hymns , journaling , and benediction the readings for reflection pull in the insight of spiritual leaders both past and present and take on both a theological and inspirational tone this particular version is adapted for use by pastor 's and laymen alike upper room is to be commended for this work it is a must have for all persons who long to deepen the spiritually formative moments of their day
job 5 8 but as for me , i would seek god , and i would place my cause before god
we bought this as a gift but have been using it for years as a devotional book
this book fed me richly for a period of two years , and i am not easy to please
provides a wonderful outline and schedule for getting into or maintaining the habit of daily prayer and devotions the themes that permeate this book are worship , forgiveness , and servanthood this is a great tool to grow with
i 've used this book for about two years as a simple , predictable structure for prayer and bible reading each week , new area or faith is explored , following the lectionary used in most churches today a simple invocation \( or opening \) prayer is presented , followed by a psalm reading next is a reading on the subject , which is borrowed from other resources \( these readings cross all boundaries in terms of geography and date written \) , followed by a scripture reading next is a time of reflection , where one is encouraged to journal and reflect upon the topic in light of the information presented from man and the word next is prayer time , a hymn , and a closing prayer a weekly recipe with some ingredients provided , the book has a life span of 4 years , with the current edition 2001 2004
december 1986 my family presented me with this book i enjoy readings of william barclay , dietrich bonhoeffer , elizabeth barrett browning , carlo carretto , richard foster , carl jung , c s lewis , henri j nouwen , mother teresa , elton trueblood , john wesley , to name a few but to have writings by these great authors compiled in one book is unimaginable on top of that there are the lyrics of some of the most well known and loved hymns included in this book there are monthly retreat models that can be done individually or with a group the story a doll of salt by anthony bloom is a wonderful simile of our developing relationship with god i have highlighted , written in the margins , and dogeared so many pages that i had to get a second copy because the first one is falling apart \( and it was the leather bound copy \) the readings are so inspiring and uplifting as well as thought provoking for the layperson as well as the ordained minister if you are going to get this book i encourage you to get the leather bound for you will discover you will use it on a daily basis along with your bible
this book was easy to read and divided into segments that allowed for user friendly access i have referred to it numerous times since i received it and would recommend it to those homeschool parents facing the teen years the best part of the book was the resources at the end of each section it helped me see what parts in our curriculum needed improvement and which parts were right on target
this is the second book i have read from cafi cohen i find her writing straightforward , exciting , and relaxing at the same time
i have been homeschooling for 11 years now and i must say this has been one of the most useful publications i have come across i have already struggled through two teens with little help and not knowing where to turn for resources there is a great deal of information for the younger years , but very little for teens this book not only give you insightful information to make your teens education well rounded and interesting , but it also provides a wealth resources to turn for further information no homeschool should be without it
i got my copy of homeschooling , the teen years and read it through immediately it was such an encouragement although we have been homeschooling for more than five years , sometimes i get cold feet and fear that we are not doing enough cafi 's book points out the many ways we educate our kids every day and gives suggestions for new things to try i highly recommend this book to people who are considering homeschooling their teens , and especially to those who are already doing it
this is a great book for anyone homeschooling teenagers in a wonderful , easy to read format , it discusses concerns of every family member mom and dad and teens and younger children the author answers questions that new homeschoolers have , such as how do we get legal \? and where do we find curriculum \? and what about a diploma \? in addition the book contains a wealth of information for experienced home educators drawing not only on the author 's years homeschooling her own children , but also on the experience of dozens of homeschooling families worldwide , this title contains an incredible number of fun , creative , practical , and money saving suggestions for all subjects writing , foreign languages , advanced math , history , science , and so on based on a survey results compiled by the author , you will find lists throughout of homeschoolers' favorites from software to historical videos to authors teens love one chapter discusses part time homeschooling and afterschooling , that is , using homeschooling resources and approaches with schooled children this is perfect for those families who want to use tried and true homeschooling resources to improve their child 's math abilities or to enrich their teen 's school history curriculum afterschooling offers ways to try homeschooling without jumping in full time above all , the book emphasizes that there is no one right way to succeed instead it details many paths to success traditional approaches , unit studies , interest initiated learning , and eclectic approaches and invites you to select those options that best fit your family
catch me if you can follows the life of frank w abignale one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was this book is the autobiographical account of abignale 's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father 's mobil credit card there are so many times in this book that i had to step back and think about the air of confidence that abignale displayed , yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him
this book was very well written and so much fun to read
we all know of frank abagnale 's personality arrogant , yet kind with class among all the different characters that he chooses to play , whether he 's a pilot , doctor , lawyer , or a college professor , i believe that frank is somewhat confused of who he is frank ran away from home at 16 the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school at 16 , most people do n't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future one thing was for sure frank wanted money and women
frank abagnale jr stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time the story is inflated at times \( in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner , a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with \) still , the catch me if you can is engaging , and abignale 's scams combine inventiveness and good humor enjoy
if you , like me , have seen the film with leonardo dicaprio and tom hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book , you are reading the right review ! if you were in front of me , i would look at you with a grin \( as if to show that i knew something you did n't \) and encourage you to do so
i read this book after watching the movie \( staring tom hanks and leonardo dicaprio \) before i started i knew i liked the story , but i did n't realize how much i loved reading abagnale 's account of his life of crime i enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot , a doctor , a professor , and a lawyer i also liked the novel 's open frankness about the author 's misdeeds
many people became aware of frank abagnale jr 's story until the movie starring tom hanks and leonardo dicapprio was released \( even though an earlier movie based on this story was released \)
not a reader of fiction , fantasy , sci fi therefore picked up a copy of catch me if you can from a bookstore yesterday
ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture
first , i want to say that this is the paperback version of the cooks illustrated complete book of poultry \( different title , different cover design \) this is a great book especially for those who eat a lot of chicken and are looking for a variety of ways to prepare it , like me there are recipes for dishes from many different traditions , which i like , and all are tasty if you look at the table of contents , you 'll see that they are arranged by cooking method , which is handy and the book has all the explanations and clear directions typical of cooks illustrated books my absolutely only complaint is that i appreciate it when an entire recipe is printed across two open pages , so i can put it in my cookbook stand and leave it there , and that is not the case here i have to turn the page but that 's minor highly recommended
this is the sort of cookbook that grows with you if you 're a novice cook , or you cook only because you have to put something on the table every night , you will find this book enlarges the number of fool proof chicken dishes you can put on the table without much fuss each chapter suggests several variations , so you can adapt to what you have on hand or what 's fresh at the store there are also handy chapters on soup , leftovers and turkey breasts

plot interesting
dear reader ,
the first seven books of a series of unfortunate events followed the same formula the baudelaire orphans are with the banker mr poe until he can find a new relative willing to care for the siblings things go badly and the evil count olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance in the end they get away and olaf is on the run from the authorities the ending of the vile village changes this the baudelaires are on the run , suspected of the murder of count olaf despite the fact that he is n't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the non existent crime the hostile hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about vfd , the quagmire triplets , and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop count olaf from coming after them ever again this time there is no mr poe and no new distant relative to live with count olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect , though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action
this book is a concise well written guide to the core issues of buying , owning and selling multifamily buildings it was extremely valuable in evaluating our first purchase of a multi family structure
as a real estate investor and author myself , i read a lot of real estate books many , if not most , are written by folks who do not invest in real estate themselves they only write about it berges is not one of them he knows his stuff and it 's clear that he practices what he preaches i have read three of his books and , i must say , he 's one of my favorite real estate authors you can trust what he says experienced investors may want a bit more detail from steve , but what he does say is accurate and safe this is a good book on buying apartments in fact , in my own book , investing in duplexes , triplexes quads , i list the best books i 've read on different areas of real estate this book is the only book i recommend on investing in commercial multifamily \( ie , apartments of 5 units and up \) properties
excellent and reasonably comprehensive introduction to the
this is the second steve berges book that i 've read i read his book , the complete guide to real estate investing he focused on obtaining value once you make the purchase that is very sound advice with so many people investing in property hoping to make a profit after they fix it , steve urges you to pursue profitability prior to making any modifications do not pursue property that requires capital investment or upgrades prior to a positive cash flow that 's very basic but sage advice
this was the first book i have purchased on the subject of real estate investing in multi family properties i have been and interested in the subject for some time however
this book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world for anyone that has already dealt with multi family , then you do not need this book however , berges other book , real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner in that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties
out of all of the real estate books i 've read over the years , this is by far one of the better ones the author stays focused on the topic of buying and selling apartments and does it in a way that is easy to understand let me emphasize that when i say the book is easy to understand , that is not meant to imply that only the basics are covered not only does berges do a great job of explaining the mechanics of the process , but he also mixes in a lot of personal examples which help the reader to connect the dots between pie in the sky theory and real world applications
the author , berges , provides unique insight into investing in apartment buildings there is n't much written about this topic , and what is , seems to be very generic this book , however , provided lots of good examples with specific advice on what to do and what not to do in addition , berges sprinkles various tidbits of information throughout the book that while not directly related to real estate , are nevertheless quite relevant to being successful in it i just finished another book of his , the complete guide to investing in rental properties , which i also found to be very enjoyable
i found this book to be an excellent primer for the novice investor who wants to learn about the basics of investing in mutual funds bogle describes the various types of mutual funds in simple plain language
i first became interested in this title because of the positive review by warren buffett there 's so much hype in the investing field that you 'll save hundreds of hours of wasted time and thousands of dollars in lost money by consulting a genius to separate the wheat from the chaff it 's not always an exciting , easy read but it 's essential knowledge if you 're investing or planning to invest in funds its simple concepts that take some mental work to understand those that make big money in individual stock investing normally invest a tremendous amount of time understanding their field and the particular companies they 're risking their money on if you do n't have the time or inclination to do this , mutual funds are one safe way to go
my first and final book on mutual funds i 've read several others , but keep returning to this one the end of chapter summaries are invaluable it is a tougher read than most and mutual funds for dummies ins easier and in the same vein
i read this book when it first came out ten years ago at the beginning of the bull market at the time the book had mixed reviews one of bogle 's warning , and probably the best advice , is to watch out for funds that charge high fees and to study all the fees charged in all funds i remember one reviewer feeling that bogle was overreacting to the fees that funds charged and that fund managers are really on our side fast forward to today , we have the mutual fund scandal and we learn that mutual fund managers are n't really working on our best interests though reading this book ca n't help you spot all the bad apples \( the janus family has alot of no load funds and it was implicated in the scandal \) it can help you be aware and thus be more weary in a nutshell , this book is comprehensive , honest and prescient john bogle is the conscience of the mutual fund industry
bogle provides an excellent guide to the world of mutual funds he begins with an introduction to three primary classes of investments namely stocks , bonds and cash reserves and goes on to provide an excellent insight into analysing and selecting a mutual fund a must read for anyone who has invested or is planning to invest in mutual funds
most of the reviews that i have written for amazon are based on the books , the dvds , and the cds that i already own i occasionally buy a new product via amazon , but i mostly review the stuff that i already own
waiting for godot was dubbed a tragicomedy and there does n't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play the random and wandering personalities of vladimir and estragon , the main characters , lend an amusing air to the entire work however , their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy \( and irritation \) , though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you unless one goes into waiting for godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing , and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be knowing a little bit about beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable , but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own what i love the most about this book is beckett 's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality vladimir and estragon are most certainly not your average joe , but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous waiting for gogot is really what you make it , because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men , it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale go in looking for a meaning , and knowing how beckett means to get things across , and i think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold a short read , and worthwhile , i would say , at least for its originality and humor
samuel beckett 's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them is godot god \? are didi and gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive , or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering \?
some think waiting for godot is an argument for existentialism others believe it is about man 's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question neither seem correct
i'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with , but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work , however , is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel it 's akin to the random scribblings of a two year old or a mud splattered canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind , it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis , because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal though look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes and brilliant artistry of the play
waiting for godot is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork , in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value in this case , however , what is behind the artwork is a non concept , the impossibility of creating a masterpiece after the monumental impossibility of joyce 's finnegans wake , what remains for the serious artist \? waiting for godot is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world in that sense , this play is the last masterpiece of high art the torch has now passed to movies and popular forms
samuel beckett 's , soon to be classic , drama about two men , vlad and estro , transcends stage play drama beckett 's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic , literal story
many readers of 'waiting for godot' obsess about the identity of godot and whether he represents god or any other almighty being it is unlikely that beckett was referring to god as the man for whom the characters are waiting , as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in beckett 's theatre
waiting for godot , a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes , attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with it is a call to action this play is packed with nonsensical dialogue the plot does not exsist yet , once we realized that waiting for godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense at least in subtle ways much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality , but , that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century it 's enigmatic , a puzzle of words , poetry , and philosophy i recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge the play is short and does not take too much commitment take a quiet evening and give it a shot what are you waiting for
this book is just what it advertises it is good down to earth and practical advice for those just starting out on their teaching careers i 've been teaching for several years but i found a good number of ideas in here to help orient our new faculty i have just pulled every book in the library i could find on preparing faculty to instruct and this one was the best of the entire pile i think it should be read by everyone just starting their teaching career
considering the size of the book i was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given they are mostly one word meanings , if there is a meaning at all mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for it was n't helpful for me i found the babyname wizard book a lot more informative and helpful
i received this book as a gift and at first i thought 100 , 000 names would be too many to look through , but the lists really helped me narrow things down plus , my husband and i had a lot of fun flipping to random pages and seeing what we 'd find !
if nothing else , this book is great fun all the names from different cultures and countries are fascinating \( though i'm not sure i 'd want to name a daughter osiris \) , especially since every name has a short description of its origin and meaning next to it
i suspect the previous review from mom of one must be unnaturally biased or somehow associated with a competitor 's title because it appears that she only exists sporadically enough to tout her chosen title , and then belittle its competitors nothing else currently seems to exist for this entity worst of all , she disclaims this book as being a copy of a title published in 2005 \( first edition 2003 \) , when a quick look up shows that this publisher meadowbrook lansky , has been making baby name books since the late 70s early 80s and is clearly one of the leaders in the field
this book bears an amazing similarity to 50 , 001 best baby names , by diane stafford but hers is better because it 's the original shame on you
the recipes were fun to make and very southern book is worth having in your kitchen , including for yankees
after watching paula deen on the food network and then visiting her restaurant , the lady and sons in savannah , i knew this cookbook collection was a must for our home her recipes are simple and delicious there is something in there for everyone with new creations that delight the palette her chicken recipes such as chicken georgia , chicken and dumplings and chicken casserole are easy and delicious the corn casserole was probably the easiest dish i have ever prepared and was gone immediately it is a great sign in my home if you do not have leftovers i do not have leftovers when i cook with paula deen the only downside is we are having to exercise more because of this delicious food i figure that it is a small price to pay for having enjoyable sit down dinners with the family i would definitely endorse this collection for any home this would be a great gift this christmas season
forget what e brown says what was this person thinking \? \? \? \? i will tell you that these are recipes that for the most part include ingredients that any southern cook will find on hand at any time simple , easy , and very tasty recipes that your family will love if some appear to have a high fat content and that bothers you then use your brain and take measures accordingly it really is that easy
to the lady who gave paula 's book a 1 star because it 's all fattening salty foods puhleeze ! she said she watches the show do you really \? paula is a southern cook and southern cooking is full of rich food she always says her favorite food is butter ! her cookbooks are fantastic every time i make something to bring to the office or to a potluck , i use one of her recipes and they always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe she 's the tops
tried true favorites , along with some new ones it does n't get any more tasty or simple than the recipes in this collection the two books together are a great deal cover just about anything you 'd ever want to whip up in the kitchen even if cooking is not your thing , paula 's recipes are so yummy , they might help change your mind
i cannot bring myself to cook anything from these books the recipes include too much fat recipes that include large amounts of butter , cream , cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty i 'll bet they taste wonderful , however creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible also i resent having to use paula 's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients , eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them
i bought this for my husband , but we both enjoyed it very much
these two books are amazing you want great southern food look no where else but paula deen i love her show so much its set in the tivo if anyone is ever in savannah a visit to the lady and sons restuarant is going to be the best stop ever made long lines so make sure to get there early to put your name on the list
these cookbooks cover it all , paula deen is simply the queen of southern cooking i highly recommend this set to anyone who loves to cook ! only exception would be people who are really watching their weight , because paula is also the queen of butter , and it 's really hard to eat small portions \)
this is the best cat care book i have ever read it really helped me with the deliver of my cats kittens and then the after care of them it also halped me train my cat not to do cetain things like scratching the carpet and couch you should get this if you have acat it really helps alot
i read this years ago when it first was published and recommended it to friends and family we all agreed that despite the unusual format , it was wonderful and we found ourselves quoting it to each other for months steve kluger is an incredible write
i 've read this book countless times now it is w o a doubt my favorite read i own 2 hardcopies and i 've just ordered more paperbacks to give out as gifts at 4 99 it is a steal
let me state , for the record , i'm not a fan of baseball unless , of course , it 's my husband or boys out on the field \( and even then , i keep my mouth shut because i really do n't know what i'm watching \) that said , i was n't sure how i 'd do with this book , but i found myself heavily engrossed in it right from the first word and loved every bit of it
if you read for pleasure , then this book is for you a page turner in which you may ignore your favorite television show just so you may read the hysterical and brazen letters between the boy and his chosen recipient \( the white house , a major league baseball player , etc \) the book illustrates the development of father son relationship between the boy and the baseball player charlie banks , the gentile baseball player , demonstrates true love for the boy by assisting him to prepare for his bar mitzvah while reading this book , one could envision a movie depicting this wonderful story
last days of summer is a thoroughly moving novel it reminds me of the movies the sandlot and my summer story , and of the play brighton beach memoirs i'm not a fan of baseball , but that did n't stop me from loving this story it 's told through a series of letters , teacher parent notes , flyers , posters , and newspaper clippings over the span of two years during world war ii , and it was a smart way of telling the story the humor is sarcastic and delightful , and you 'll become engrossed in the relationships and friendships made because of this , you wo n't be able to stop crying \( or at least get misty eyed \) i recommend
so many books with boys as the central character have plots that center around athletics or some sort of heroic action this one manages to keep those themes \( baseball , a major war \) and still make the story about a friendship this book is very funny , but more importantly it is a special window into how people can make a difference in each other 's lives and a bonus is that the letters to each other format \( who remembers what epistolary means anymore \? \) makes it an easy read
i have been looking for this book for a while after my boss suggested we read this i enjoyed it and i wanted to share it , but i could n't remember the name , just the style and subject
i read this book twice in the same week i read constantly anything and everything but i 've never done that before i laughed so hard several times that tears were running down my face ! i have recommended it to every person that i talk to that is a reader when working in a bookstore years ago , the publisher sent the book to us to read before it went on sale i have no idea how many i actually hand sold , but it was a lot
this is a great book i recommened for anyone in the 8th grade or in high school i read this book because the cover and tittle sounded good but i read the first letter to charlie banks and i was hooked if you dont read the entire book you will miss it so do n't just try spark notes read the book
i enjoyed the characters in this book i loved the feelings you got from sarah and felt her feelings of just sticking with something because you do n't want to rock the boat in case there is n't anything better for you ! moving on can be a scary spot to be in
the pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning i 've never read a danielle steel before and i wo n't be speeding to the nearest barnes noble to get another one other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition i picked up on that before reading the reviews there have also been suggestions that steel needs an editor for gawd 's sake , she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world ! they must have hundreds of editors but perhaps , just perhaps , they are intimidated by the prolific ms steel then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility nobody could be as eccentric as stanley and run a powerful \( and megarich \) conglomerate there 's no way a house as large as the house \( in the center of san francisco , no less \) could ever be bought and restored for 750 , 000 the oh so happy ending is as predictable as the setting 's weather ms steel has made a lot of money from her readers they deserve better than this
danielle steel used to be one of my favorite authors however , wanderlust was the last book of hers that i really liked i bought the house hoping maybe she had found her style again , but alas it was not to be i do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points of view within one paragraph , telling not showing the story , and repeating the same things over and over and over until i just want to scream ! it seems that perhaps because she is such a big name , her work is not copyread anymore i think it might be time for her to put away her pen , or get back to the basics of good writing i will not be buying another of her books anytime soon i chose to rate this book with one star , because no stars was n't a choice
it 's summer , and my reading matter always lightens up significantly ! i spotted this book at the library and figured , why not ! i know , i said never again for danielle steel , but the plot interested me how bad could it be , right \?
after chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead end romance , she finally buys the house aha , i thought , the story begins but alas , not much happens then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house , and i think , ok here 's the story , but not to be then there is the architect that enters a good love story no
do n't waste your time or money on this book it was about as interesting as watching paint dry ! maybe danielle steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out
i just finished this book , and thought , i could see where someone would say it was boring but i just loved the story , loved the history of sarah tracking down her great grandmother , loved the details of the house \( and was very jealous of such a nice house ! \) , and all in all , this was one of the better of danielle steel 's recent works yes , there was some repetition , but not as bad as impossible i would say if you 've been hesitating to pick up a danielle steel book lately , as i have , this one might actually be enjoyable ! ! is she on her way back \? i know we all hope so as we know she is capable of great work , that 's why we stay her fans
i wasted time reading this book that i will never get back it was repetitive , predictable , and drawn out i only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending , but it turned out the way i thought it would buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly , and for predicting how the story goes but , i would not waste the time if i were you
i read a lot a lot and rarely have i read a book that i really , really did n't like , but this is one of them there is such a lack of dialogue , and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over i swear , if i would have had to read the words four years one more time \( referring to the main character 's failed relationship \) i would have hurt somebody there was so much that could have been done with this book but , by the time she actually gets the house , you 've been bored stiff for four years and do n't much care it seems to be that it was poorly edited , and there is a lot of awkward grammar i was really disappointed
kubler ross teaches us how to understand the death of a family member or loved one and how to cherish the final moments with them
this book is one of the first great books that dr kubler ross has gifted us with her insight and compassion are unremarkable i am sad she wo n't be writing any more books though her latest book , on grief and grieving is a wonderful book also there are some case studies to go by and it truly touches your soul
elisabeth kubler ross once again inspires us to learn how to care for those dying patients and their family members this book assists our care and compassion through true life experiences of those dying this book grabs at your heart and pulls you in !
each time people around me lost their family , i gave this book most of them said that it was a great help to recover from grief i , myself experienced a hard time to accept mentally a familly member 's death and the book gave me a relief , though i do not believe everything written in it
though written back in the 60 's , this was a very interesting , thought provoking read on treatment of and interaction with people who are terminally ill it gives valuable insight into why people act or do not act in certain ways and as to how they want to be treated when they are dying , children as well as adults it also covers family interactions which are so critical to the patient 's emotional physical state of being
a book by one of the most eminent writers on the psychology of death and dying , this volume goes through what the dying have to say to doctors , nurses , clergy and their own families other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance , this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles the course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy thus there is a strong christian element first , this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity , but i soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith , which put things in perspective
i have n't had a chance to read the book in its entirity , but have enjoyed what i have read
for most of us , the area of thanatology is something quite new , despite the fact that death is such an intimate companion that can come at any moment of our lives , whether by degrees or instantaneously , irrelevant of our ethnic , social and economic backgrounds it is a plain truth that can not be avoided , and no technological advancements can make it go away i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you , despite what your feelings may be and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier , the adult must equally do so with death , not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means the total cessation of physical life , for if one denys its existence and its inevitability , the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache , but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental , spiritual and religious grief as well submission to and acceptance of the truth , no matter how difficult it would be to hear , could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing in elizabeth kubler ross 's classic study of the dying process , she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person , the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all hence , how do you take the sting from the wound \? in on death and dying , you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say , to let them vent , and at their own pace , go through the classic defined stages of the dying process denial and isolation , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance the patients become our teachers we learn of their fears , their possible financial burdens , in one woman 's case , the fear of the worms , et cetera but we also learn about what the families go through , their own anger and disbelief and guilt it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger , other times not the united states is one of the most death denying countries out there , a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process , for going foward means only one thing death ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is , the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe death has issues for everybody , doctors , faith filled people , even ross heself it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together
this book is very helpful to understand the overall grieving process from counselor to doctor to family and ultimately , to a terminally ill patient , this book can be very helpful recommended highly
bereavement counseling the grieving throughout the life cycle is a compact little book that covers the basics of grief counseling author david a crenshaw ph d presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss these tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by elisabeth kubler ross crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages preschool children , school age children , adolescents , young adults , adults in midlife , and the elderly , using abbreviated case histories as examples
my husband and i are lawyers who have recently returned to reading shakesepare , decades after college we wanted literary criticism that was qualitative superior to the plot summary readers guide criticism that would help us explore the imagery , themes and metaphors of the plays marjorie garber is the answer to our prayers we recommend to readers returning to shakespeare that they purchase a paperback edition of each play with good notes to help with line specific language issues the arden series is the best and then supplement enrich the experience with garbers insights it is a pleasure for us to carefully read each play and then see what treasures she has mined based on her own reading and that of prior critics we considerably prefer garber to bloom as a single compendium garber packs an enormous amount of insight into a single 30 page chapter shakespeare is surely worth the detail she provides i would also suggest that you purchase the ambrose dvd set of tapes of the great bbc plays after you have read the plays it is wonderful to watch jacobi et al the dvd format enables captions which is very helful to savoring every line
william shakespeare 's immortal words will live forever in this excellent book of criticism professor garber of harvard
this is a monster of a book packed full of insight into the plays of william shakespeare another reviewer has criticized the way professor gerber tackles each play , but i think she pitches her analyses pretty spot on as she describes a play she will stop and detour into some aspect of the cultural mores of the england of shakespeare 's day and come back i find \( as a layman \) that is exactly what i wanted i was n't looking for heavy textual criticism that might only be understandable to other eng lit professors this is an excellent book for the layman if you are prepared to concentrate and forgive professor gerber when she does occasionally throw in a semantics term that you have never heard of usually she explains them but not always
this is a wonderful , rich , exploratory book that holds nothing back a meditation about the shakespeare canon that resonates in all planes at once it is certain to be by college teachers everywhere , and so it should be together with shapiro 's 1599 as a biography and a solid encyclopaedia like the oxford companion to shakespeare , this is one of the only supplementary volumes you 'd ever want to shelf next to the complete works this is the kind of full service critical homage and investigation shakespeare has been waiting for all these years i hope he and marjorie garber meet in heaven , and that someone leaks the resulting sonnets
marjorie garber 's shakespeare after all is first rate scholarship on shakespeare 's plays it is a 'must have' for anyone interested in shakespeare 's works whether the person has a casual interest or a scholarly background the information is conveyed in an accessible style i have purchased a number of copies and given this work as gifts to friends one should pick it up and read it
as a fan of shakespeare \( both on the stage screen and written page \) , i have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright first there was asimov 's guide to shakespeare , which was a well written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays then , there was harold bloom 's shakespeare , the invention of the human , a scholarly work offset by a tone of high toned intellectual snobbery and condescension now , there is shakespeare after all , a work that fits between these two in quality
i bought this book on the strength of marjorie garber 's excellent past renaissance scholarship i was expecting something more theoretically informed and original , but as it is this is a very worthwhile book , and i predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students it 's a big book with a substantial chapter on each play \( but not the sonnets \) , as with harold bloom 's book on shakespeare garber , however , is less idiosyncratic than bloom she synthesizes the best of recent scholarship , but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la derrida and lacan garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context for example , in her chapter on macbeth , she relates a new critical analysis of the clothing imagery to sumptuary laws regarding clothing \( laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of renaissance england \) the strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play , which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts , and her brilliant analysis of shakespeare 's language , i e , close reading while her work is illuminated by recent scholarship , she avoids the stalinesque imperatives of political correctness compare garber 's intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in macbeth with stephen orgel 's introduction in the complete pelican shakespeare , in which he reductively reads the play as a misogynist fantasy the only reason i docked the book one star is that , based on the chapters i 've read so far , she does n't really make a major original contribution to shakespeare studies \( in contrast to , for example , greenblatt 's recent bio of shakespeare , will in the world \) so much as synthesize what we already know all in all , a very valuable reference book that i will be consulting regularly in my college teaching highly recommended for high school teachers , english majors \( undergraduate and graduate \) , and all fans of shakespeare
clear and present danger is an action packed and informing novel by tom clancy it places you into the united states government fight the war on drugs the government is stepping up its assault on teh druggies after the director of the fbi is killed in bogota a young staff sergeant domingo chavez joins the fight as a scout in an elite group of soldiers fighting the druggies directly
i 'd go as far to say this is better than the hunt for red october compared to the dire offerings clancy serves up now such as red rabbit , this book is good enough to make you wonder if it was not written by a different author
the story of the book goes a high ranking u s offical is killed in colombia , and the socking covet u s response this is the fifth book in the jack ryan series would recommend to anyone
the book begins like modern headlines and top stories in the news a coast guard boat discovers several dead bodies on a drifting boat out at sea piecing together the scenes the captain and his crew understand the grisly details which became all too clear before the discovery , they announce their intention to board the boat , only to find two columbians who speak little and look guilty as sin the captain and crew have the presence of mind to record on film permanently what the encountered they nearly gag at what they find contrary to usual procedure , they create a justice at sea bogus trial based on some ancient mariner 's manual it is just the right scenario to create fear in their prisoners which extracts a confession from them that the coast guard believes will stand up in court and get them prosecuted
well first off , i did not like the book nor the movie , both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art on the other hand , i take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here , as some sound very anti american in their reviews we being good americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not we do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the american experience for that if you do not understand this , tnen be quiet about things you do not understand
veteran voice performer j charles is not only one of the most accomplished audio book narrators working today , he 's also one of the busiest both listeners and publishers seem to know that if mr charles lends his narrative skills to a production it 's going to be highly listenable an example is his rendering of this techno thriller by the unparalleled tom clancy
clear and present danger is ok at points , but the rest of the novel is boring with the cia work , the action between the commandos do n't feel realistic , the story drags on on for hundreds of pages , the boring details of how big a ship is , that is boring ! if you want to read a real and exciting novel , read bob mayer 's eyes of the hammer bib mayer is a former special forces officer , the action is there , and is very exciting unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action
i'm a big tom clancy fan and i just loved every minute reading this book very well done very well written could n't have been done better mr clancy always kept me on the edge and he is able to put in alot of great info and he knows soo much about alot of what he writes in his boo
with some interesting twists and a complicated plot , this author grips the reader baseline story involves a good cop , a failed one who makes a living after resigning from the police force and struggles with a drinking problem , and a retired one who become involved after a murder hauntingly familiar to an unsolved one from many years ago by a serial killer who was never caught in the course of attempting to solve the murder , a dirty cop is unearthed the violent ending resolves part of the mystery along the way , good insight is offered into the lives of the police and their everyday struggles with the overwhelming crime rate in d c this author is widely admired for the pace of his novels , making them hard to put down crisp dialogue , excellent settings , and believeable characters as well as sharp observations about today 's world make the book an excellent read
as far as crime dramas go , this is firmly mediocre the story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically , but the author 's writing style is sometimes a distraction why do the african american suspects always ask for slice soda to drink \? and they repeatedly make a point of asking for slice \( do they even make it anymore \? i thought it was replaced by sierra mist \) and another distracting detail is the author 's way of giving so many people nicknames you do n't need to tell me that a guy 's name is ed smiley jones if you never mention smiley again or there 's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname that said , i liked the use of dc as the backdrop and if i was going on a plane ride , i would probably pick up another book by pelecanos \( but i would n't let anyone see what i was reading and then i 'd leave it in the seatback when i deplaned \)
i love to read and listen to books on cd but i have tried to listen to this a couple of times and i am disgusted the language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that i ca n't get past the second disc very disappointed
in the field of crime novel writers , there are 5 current ones who make it to my a list
i have n't read every crime author 's work , but i have read works by a number of those considered to be top echelon writers and , for my money , pelecanos is the hands down best of the bunch and of his work , the night gardener is one of the best novels
in 1985 , three teenagers are murdered in washington d c each of the victims have names that form palindromes otto , ava and eve at the scene are t c cook , hard boiled detective sargeant and two near rookies , gus ramone and dan doc holiday the palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of cook flash forward to 2005 gus ramone is married now and has two mixed race children dan holiday left the police force under a cloud t c cook , long retired , has been forgotten by nearly all , along with the palindrome murders
i have read everything mr pelecanos has written and generally find his work to be thoughtful and original the night gardener is his best work to date the stories are interesting and well paced but it the characters and the subtlety with which they are drawn and brought together that makes this book special the conclusion is thought provoking and important it is true to the characters and believable all in all a great book mr pelecanos has packed so much into 372 pages , in itself this is an impressive feat
when you think of crime fiction you think of cities and the writers who depict them in their books michael connelly , robert crais , walter mosley los angeles carl hiassen south florida lawrence block new york ed mcbain a city like new york and so on no writer does washington dc like george pelecanos
well guess what its harry 's second year at hogwarts he 's back with hermione and ron he 's just discovered that he can talk to snakes but does n't know why , until after a while they tell him he can speak parsel tongue \( able to speak to snakes \) this gets him into trouble because he goes into the girl 's bathroom and starts to speak parsel tongue and it opens a secret door to the chamber of secrets there he faces tom riddle and wins by destroying his journal
an elf appearing to harry potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery the chamber of secrets , he said , had been opened and a monster is lurking harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster , challenge it and save students who have been petrified by the monster age group interest early teen i wanted to see what all the rave was about lots of action , not much morale
still amazed by j k rowlings writing and still in love with the book it 's well worth the read too bad the movie kind of ruined it for me after
great information and easy read i learned more in one book than the other 5 i read on the heart and the things we can do to help heal as a yoga instructor i will recommend this to my ailling students
the view that all types of medicine \( western and eastern \) working together makes sense this book seems to encorage a balance between both i enjoyed it
i think dr oz is a fantastic doctor and i have heard him speak on tv but i did not find any useful information in this book for my life
this is the worst book i have ever read , , it is very dull and unuseful i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it i wish i can return it and get a refund but i have threogh it in the tras
what is impressive about this book is the author 's concepts of healing both heart and mind as he points out just how closely the two are interconnected the writing style is one that will grasp the reader 's attention from start to finish the approach to holistic health is a welcome approach to healing it is a concept that is gradually increasing in the health care field , but one that still has a long way to go before it is universally accepted by all physicians more education and information needs to be provided in this area to all health care providers using the holistic approach , there can be fewer side effects from medication , less depression and a general feeling of well being during the most trying and difficult times there is much to be said on combining western and eastern traditions in the process of healing our world can benefit dramatically from this approach and the author vividly explains why throughout the pages of this well researched and superbly written book it is highly recommended reading material and most deserving of a five star rating
though need to get out the dictionary sometimes
i like typing i like seeing my words in print on the internet i have a lot of time to waste but all in all , it is a good book that is in ok shape for its age and was at a good price
this book if full of helpful information and is organized in a way that makes it easy to use for reference purposes give it a once through and then shelve it for reference purposes this one is worth having in your management collection
any manager with hiring authority knows that selecting the right candidate for any position is a nerve wracking task professional processes can help you screen , interview and review , but the final choice is often as much art as science author martin yate 's basic book can help inexperienced managers hire effectively , although this useful primer on interviewing and hiring is a little wordy yates provides great detail about key steps , such as when to schedule a phone interview , what to ask and how to conduct an interview he even provides numerous sample questions for each major job category , from entry level to management is it a little too basic \? perhaps for some , but we recommend it for new managers who are inexperienced at hiring although this book covers the fundamentals of hiring , it ca n't guarantee that you 'll make the right choice every time then again , that book probably has n't been written
like many small business people , i was a complete bozo at hiring for many years fortunately , at some point i woke up to that fact and decided to educate myself i took classes , read books and did everything i could to become a skilled interviewer without question , one of the most helpful tools to escaping bozoland was this book although i am now a freelance business consultant and have no employees of my own , i frequently assist my clients with their own hiring processes , and in so doing i still refer extensively to martin yate 's excellent book
this is an extremely well written and very useful book on hiring techniques and methods the author analyzes all aspects of the hiring process beginning with the different types of resumes and when each type is used what flags to look for and how to evaluate an applicant 's overall resume chapter five focuses on short listing through a `phoner' while the subsequent chapters are devoted to interviewing techniques and the science of asking questions
i use this book both for interviewing techniques and for preparing to be interviewed its a great book for interviewing because he presents the pros and cons of different techniques and gives what i consider to be a good framework for identifying quality candidates its a great book for preparing to be interviewed because it helps you identify the objectives of interviewers and make a better case as a hiring manager , you should be able to pass an interview with flying colors , should n't you \?
if you are looking for a solid foundation of your interview process , take a look at this book it provides helpful ideas on how to approach your job candidates can they do the job , are they willing and can they be managed it provided lots of helpful questions and processes for a successful hiring process i have to say , that i am not a professional recruiter just someone that needs to hire and evaluate his new employees
this book has that unique ability to make you feel as though you are learning something while , at the same time , make you feel like you knew nothing until you opened the book schaeffer is a good writer and has good observations
schaeffer adds yet another book to the this is why christians have it right category of literature though christians , nor schaeffer , by no means have a monopoly on such an approach i found it to be especially unsettling in it 's lack of insight into modernism
the idea of the project how should we then live \? , both as a film documentary and as a book , was conceived in 1974 and completed in 1976 in the acknowledgments , francis schaeffer writes about the idea behind the project using my study , over the past forty years , of western thought and culture as a base , we could attempt to present the flow and development which have led to twentieth century thinking , and by so doing hope to show the essential answers the subtitle to how should we then live \? is the rise and decline of western thought and culture starting from ancient roman times , tracing man 's development throughout the middle ages , going to the renaissance , reformation , and enlightenment , he shows the steps which led to the modern era
while my own convictions are not reflected in schaeffer 's books , he always presents a thoughtful challenge to those who would disagree with his positions this book is no exception for a broader view of the nature of morality , see my morality does 'god' make a difference \? where i show why and how belief in god makes a difference for good or ill
in this book , schaeffer illustrates that the reason the world is in such disarray is because we no longer have a moral and ethical foundation to build upon this book explores the paramount philosophic , religious , and scientific ideas from the decline of rome until the 1960s he claims that in order to understand where we are today we must trace these three lines in history he begins with the decline of rome \( with its amalgamation of greek values \) and proceed through the middle ages , the renaissance , the reformation , the enlightenment , romanticism , industrialism , modernity , and the post modern world not only does schaeffer explore the history of western philosophy , religion , and science , but also history art , culture , cinema , christianity , humanism , and communism furthermore , there is a flow to history that is rooted in people 's thoughts their thought world determines how they act the results of this thought world \( or world view \) impact the external world schaeffer points out that individual people throughout the establishment of western culture impacted the external world with their lives these impacts led to the present culture that we live in now many of these individuals shaped our culture to reject a biblical foundation with absolute morals and ethics to live by instead of this moral foundation , the west is now functioning on top of a feeble , relative foundation schaeffer asserts that this is the reason our culture is in its current hysteria he basically divides man and his view on the world into the two categories of belief in an infinite god \( christianity \) and belief in the absence of an infinite deity \( humanism \) the book provides evidence proving that the christian belief promotes a solid basis for morals , ethics , and order however , humanism promotes relativism and chaos it is on this basis that schaeffer proves that without christian principles , a culture is doomed to failure he points out that christianity gives meaning and beauty to all individual and corporate life anything short of it brings death to every aspect of life because of this , schaeffer is not hesitant to point out that the cure for society rests in christianity alone this book was written so that we would turn from the greatest of wickedness , the placing of any created thing in the place of the creator , and that this generation may get its feet out of the paths of death and may live
not many people know that there was a 10 episode film series with the same title , and that there is a paper back study guide that compliments this book i first read this book 22 years ago when i was trying to figure out why the world was going to hell in a handbasket it answered a lot of my questions and made me ask more questions i rate this as one of the 10 most important books i 've read in my lifetime , and i'm getting to be an old lady now i'm getting ready to read it again because i feel it has a new relevance for our time in light of the persecution of christianity in the public arena i also bring to your attention his book , a christian manifesto if you seek true wisdom born of knowledge , this is your book
francis a schaeffer covers a lot of territory both geographically and in terms of subject matter in this book chronologically he starts with ancient rome and goes to the 1970s , the time the book was published illustrations are included to assist in making his case schaeffer contends there is a flow or pattern to history and in this book he sets out to explain the flow of western culture on page 52 he discusses the role philosophy had in separating the influence of divine revelation as found in the bible from man made epistemology he uses raphaels' painting of the school of athens \( c 1510 \) to illustrate the separation symbolically the painting depicts two viewpoints , one looking upward toward god , the other viewing lower sources such as man in europe this gravitation toward one or the other direction took the forms of the reformation \( god \) and the renaissance \( man \) he discusses the philosophies of the prime movers in each of the two schools of thought on page 108 he notes many good things in england came from scotland one of them being the concept of lex rex law is king the concept was that no one was above the law , that it was the same for everyone regardless of rank or position he traces the idea for the american revolution back to these seeds planted in the minds of those of english ancestary the reader is carried up to the 1970s this is a thought provoking book that helps a person see cause and effect consequences over the long haul it reminds one of the observation of russell kirk , ideas have consequences
far from reducing the islamic republic of iran to some kind of timeless expression of islamic culture , tradition , or identity , the author demonstrates the competing ideological influences that shaped the islamic republic not least of which were western notions of political particpation the author does a good job of showing how these tensions are reflected in the reform movement , and in the struggle for power currently unfolding in iran thus i found the book very useful i would only add that the author may have given insufficient attention to the power of the conservative clerics
despite the breathless headlines about the latest billion dollar merger , most mergers do n't work in fact , more than half of all mergers fail , derailed by a common set of pitfalls companies merge without considering how they 'll integrate after the deal they do n't communicate properly with their employees , and executives do n't make decisions quickly enough to placate frightened workers the executives who navigate mergers effectively are those who communicate well , deal with ambiguity and make decisions in times of instability author price pritchett offers an easily digested primer on the hazards of mergers , and lists hints for avoiding common problems the authors provide plenty of concrete examples showing how such companies as sony , wells fargo and the chicago sun times suffered from the dilemmas that accompany mergers we recommend this comprehensive guide for managers on both sides of a business marriage caution read after the merger before you merge
this book should have been an short magazine article the authors basically dissect one concept over and over and over change is disruptive there is very little useful information in this book it points out all of the obvious and frequently stated problems that come with change productivity suffers , commitment is lost , etc , etc , etc , but gives no insight in how to fix the problems \( unless you count these golden nuggets keep your eye on the ball and provide direction \) the one chapter that i hoped would shed some light on tactics integration project management was pure fluff it offered such pearls of wisdom as it is helpful to look at the integration process as a logical sequence of steps designed to help bring the two organizations together not only is this a duh statement , but it shows up in chapter 8 ! i would expect to read something like that in the introduction and chapters 5 and 6 state that you should evaluate key talent in the aquired firm but no where in these chapters does it tell you how to do it ! i guess you have call up pritchett amp associates \( and fork over big \) for the details my only guess is that the authors kept the book generic on purpose so that companies would call and ask about their consulting services my advice save your money for a real book , and just call up pritchett amp associates for their marketing literature
i find it suprising how so many people can not like this book \? i read it immediatley after reading book 1 and still thoroughly enjoyed it i love the details the author gives it makes you feel like you are right there , and understand and see things as well as the characters do
i do n't know why some people are criticizing this book as badly as they are like all fantasy books and stories , if you strip them down far enough you get the same basic story characters are whats important in these books , and , while eragon has much in common with luke skywalker they are different people with different personalities and experiences to give this anything less than 3 stars is pure hateration lay off the haterade , this book continues the trilogy very well the training was a little dull and the romance subplot leaves a lot to be desired , but this is a good , well written \( especially for his age \) novel i look forwarded to reading the 3rd and final installment
eragon was a great book , and much like a previous reviewer said , i read it rather quickly it was action packed and suspensful eldest does a good of furthering the trilogy , and has a lot of action paolini leaves many questions unanswered , so you can expect an amazing final book in the series however , despite the action , eragon 's training is incredibly boring , dull , tiresome , any other adjective that is synonymous to zzzzzzz the worse part is , that his training is half the book ! there are a few good training sessions , but these are actually outside the training \( if you have n't read the book you might not understand what i am getting out \) overall , it was still a good novel and i really do n't know why someone would even consider giving it anything lower than 3 stars
eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from christopher paolini although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well i have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary , they have been enraptured by the story we ca n't wait for book number three
the story continues , with eragon being trained by the elfs , his brother rowan becoming involved , leading up to a great battle with a surprising twist delightful read you learn a lot more about the humans , elfs , dwarfs , dragons , and urgals ca n't wait to see how it all ends
yukio mishima is , sadly , known best for the circumstances of his death he committed seppuku \( ritual suicide by sword \) after finishing the final book of this tetralogy the sea of fertility he , along with kawabata and murakami , is one of the most prominent japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life mishima was called a radical , a right winger some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly , but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they 're reading him to begin with
this is the first of a group of four novels by mishima called the sea of fertility taken as a group they are excellent novels or even what one might call a literary masterpiece the four books are
this tetralogy is the best source i 've come across about the consciousness only school of buddhism in a doctrinaire free , passionate and beautiful story , you come to really understand what budhist doctrines about reincarnation mean
spring snow is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written , as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right it is an eloquent , moving story with a tale as old as time , that of star crossed lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations
this is not an intent to \( summarize \) mishima 's sea of fertility rather it 's an approach into analyzing it a sort of reading between the lines
for a japanese nationalist , yukio mishima seems to have had an appreciation for european literature , as demonstrated in his wonderful novel spring snow , the first part of a tetralogy taking place in tokyo in the years following the russo japanese war and just before the first world war , it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth century epic with an almost tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a stendhalian romance appropriately , one of its themes is the gradual influx of western influence on japanese culture , which mishima , himself loyal to the samurai tradition , might well have resisted
mishima 's spring snow is a rare jewel of a work ! the passion , tragedy and intensity of this novel left me wanting to pursue the entire 'sea of fertility' series i will shortly be reading 'runaway horses' which follows it , but have been forewarned not to expect anything quite on the scale of 'spring snow ' luckily , this does n't concern me , mishima 's writing style is visual , entrancing and magnetic he takes hold of your imagination , curiosity and emotions from the very first chapter , and you just ca n't stop till the final page i myself was dreading reaching the final page of spring snow , as i knew that to read such a glorious book again may not come for a long while
most of what i read is modern the stories take place in the here and now , and are dialogue heavy it 's nice to read something old fashioned , where the words are important if this were a story of privileged young americans , i would n't be interested but change the country and the era , and the same story becomes interesting
this is the beginning of the posthumous work of mishima you will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with honda his flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions , that even characters did not realized themselves so well , are so elaborated and sometimes scare us it seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius but you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again
i would give this book a zero , if it were possible
this book has made me a more confident mom every thing my son goes to do is so easy and i believe it is because of babywise he slept through the night for the first time at 6 weeks and was consistently sleeping through the night by 11 weeks he naps great and is so easy to take care of i have the 2nd babywise book and about to purchase the 3rd toddlerwise i recommend this book to any new mom who is seeking to get her baby on a schedule and it also contributed to me nursing my son for 7 months i was about ready to give it up when i read the book b c i felt like a human pacifier this book will encourage your baby to take the feedings at scheduled times
hi i am the mother of twin preemie fraternal twins which are now 8 months old my oldest twin weighed 2 4 and the youngest 4 8 lbs my boys were hospitalized for 6 weeks when we brought them home i thought wow , i really have them on the right track my youngest boy would whale everynight no matter what i tried swaddling , holding , everything , nothing worked until , someone gave me this wonderful book
this book is highly recommended by our church and all of our friends swear by this method it is a little on the strict side , as far as scheduling goes we also read the baby whisperer \( which is more relaxed less rigid \) and are planning to take what works for us from each book , as they both offer some great principles they both follow the same pattern routine of eat , activity , sleep , then time for mom dad
after observing many parent friends and the sanity of their homes i decided babywise was definitly worth reading my friends with the happiest well adjusted and well behaved children use babywise my friends who oppose babywise and feel it is wrong or evil have never personally read the book from cover to cover but have only adopted the opinions of naysayers also , many of these have children sleeping in their beds between mom dad until they are 4 years old , are cranky , needy chilren and live chaotic lives
first off my wife and i tried babywise several years ago because we were sleep deprived beyond all belief please do n't make the same mistake your baby will start sleeping better , i swear other parents we know have tried babywise and the results of ranged from abandoning the philosophy to seriously altering their children 's psyche
i strongly recommend new parents thoughtfully consider baby wise in developing your parenting style
this is the best baby book i 've read i would highly recommend it
to those who think this book recommends ignorning a hungry child just because he ate 2 hours ago rather than the prescribed 3 , i suggest you read the book a little more carefully the feeding schedule is just a guideline , and the book does emphasize \( in several places \) that when your child is hungry , food should never be denied , hunger cues should never be ignored parents read the book , then make up your mind on whether or not this technique is one you want to adopt if you have n't read the book , keep your opinions to yourself no one cares to know what you learned after doing a google search on the author if the information in the book makes sense to you , and your pediatrician does n't disagree , does it really matter in what subject the author earned his master 's degree \?
this book is about setting boundaries for your child at a young age i read the book in one sitting because it was fascinating and the next night after following the advice , my son slept for 9 hours \( he was 4 months old \) he has consitently been a very well behaved , happy , and well adjusted child a routine , established boundaries , and yes even discipline gives your child confidence \( mommy actually knows what 's up ! ! \) i 've met moms who thought babywise was terrible and cruel , but interstingly enough not a single one of them had actually read the book and guess what \? \? the same babies that decided their own schedules turned into toddlers and children that ran the household if you do n't teach your kids the rules and boundaries , they will learn them the hard way by testing you
seems like an easy enough subject but so many books like this are just fluffy ideas for employers to rah rah , and lie , to the employees said to say it 's true
i'm donald freeman , former general manager of operations for sprint call center in phoenix , az \( read more about don in fish tales by charthouse \) this books is a must for anyone currently involved in bringing fun into the workplace and a good book to place beside the book fish by charthouse i got real examples from companies and employees in this book that provided me with great ideas to use in my own business this book provides many detailed examples from companies who have found being productive is fun it provides real examples on how companies become a place where people care and where people count the book demonstrates the importance of celebrations that are honest and really are celebrations of being happy ! she provides a lot of insight and their are shared ideas that can be used that have little cost but really make a difference in terms of caring and making work fun ! it gives feedback from individuals who found the value and success in bringing fun to work if anyone has been challenged with using the fish philosophy as a tool for fun at work , this book may be the ticket for making it all come together
begins with an ominous warning by ancient historian herodotus if a man insisted always on being serious , and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation , he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it the rest of the book is an attempt to prevent these dire things from happening especially in the workplace the book is bubbly bubbly excitement prevails but near the end , the author cautions us that , excess is too much even when it comes to fun and i'm sure a man as smart as herodotus would also say that if you have fun all the time with no seriousness at all , that could be dangerous too
if you 're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun fish ! is the one i 'd recommend in fun works , the author presents eleven principles that are supposed to help us understand the importance of the fun work fusion with eleven principles , this book is all over the place , and somehow misses the mark i fervently believe that work should be fun , but i did n't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way
i do not know where to start i read nora roberts all the time and this is by far my favorite of her trilogies there is a little of everything sorcery , vampires , witches , time travel , battles and of course romance do not even think about it just get the book and find a quiet place to settle down and get started
some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if i had read them first i have enjoyed this book , the vampire , geall setting did not turn me off actually it was a nice change
i 've been a nora roberts fan for years but originally was turned off by a review i 'd read for this book you see , while i can deal with sorcery , witches and the like as in the key trilogy and the island trilogy i have a hard time with fantasy worlds tell me we 're in scotland , and i have an appropriate mental image but , tell me we 're in geall and , well , i'm really lost
this book has been summarized often enough that i do n't think it will be necessary for me to give yet another summary
this is book one of the circle trilogy
nora roberts 's books are my escape , and usually a blissful one i love the magic , character development , strong women overcoming obstacles , and romance found in her novels morrigan 's cross disappointed me vampires are a little over the edge for me , but what made me close the book was the 10 year old vampire with the protaganist i spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable , and reading this put me in a bad mood king was a comic relief , but he got killed that was when i did something i 've never done with a n r book closed it , put it in the closet , and later sold it i'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy instead , i took out the three sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself
i am a big fan of nora roberts i love the ones that she writes with a touch of magick in them , and this time she delivers in a big way witches , vampires , shift shaper , time travelers , and of course , romance
i just love nora roberts , but i have to say she has truly outdone herself with the latest the circle trilogy they are hard to put down great reading
just not my cup of tea well written but as i said not my cup of tea i will not purchase the others in the series
when i heard nora had written another trilogy , i was excited normally i ca n't wait to finnish them however , i have only managed to get about halfway through this book i found it hard to from the past to the present , and vampires just are n't my thing i suppose knowing me , i 'll leave this for a couple months , then try to read it again
as a middle aged gay man growing up in a california suburb , i felt isolated and alone during my formative years had i seen a book like this and learned that far from being alone i was part of a rich and wonderful cultural tradition i think it would have made a huge difference thanks to the authors of this book
lehane is a master of his genre and this offering is one of his best the story moves with riptide speed , and each page brings new surprises and plot twists lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and does n't insult their intelligence at least most of the time bubba , for example , is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck , lehane could n't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like bubba a plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused that 's why i like him and intend to read all his books
i really liked this book lehane has great character development you feel like these people are real \( patrick , angie , bubba \) gotta love that bubba ! ! more please mr lehane
lehane has outdone himself on this one starting with a seemingly sad unconnnected event \( the suicide of a client kenzie only spoke to once , and then forgot to respond to her phone message \) , kenzie begins a search for truth it will lead him back from the depressive edge of insanity that resulted from the events of 'gone , baby , gone' and once again into the arms of angela gennaro \( hopefully for good \)
when a former client of patrick kenzie kills herself mere months after he warned off her stalker , kenzie , out of a profound sense of guilt , investigates after reconciling with his former partner and lover , angie gennaro , the two stumble upon a the truth that the client was systematically stripped of everything in her life until she committed suicide the responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed , and has now set his sights on kenzie and gennaro
lehane strikes gold once again with this kenzie gennaro adventure although , the reader must have realized by now that his titles do n't really have anything to do with the plot \( except , gone , baby , gone , mystic river and shutter island \) , one ca n't deny the fact that lehane is one of the very best there is
i got hooked on lehane after mystic river , and his thriller shutter island was absolutely gripping and completely mind twisting i had to stay up late one night to finish that , and i could n't sleep afterwards , so i had to read a dave barry book to take my mind off it ! i should have learned my lesson , because as soon as i got into prayers for rain , i could n't get the creepiness and mystery out of my head , and i once again had to stay up late to finish the entire book
this was by far the best genero kenzie novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one , you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable
the only thing i can say about dennis lehane is when 's the next one going to print \? for myself , i thought 'prayers' dialogue was a bit snappier , more colorful , than the others but that 's me one of the many things i enjoy about lehane 's writing is that he puts as much effort into the last ten pages as he did the first ten in detective and mystery stories , that 's rare indeed
love this cookbook ! ! i already put post its in all of the recipies i want to try which is almost half the book ! \) i just made the carbanara and it was amazing ! ! ! i even have leftovers so i can have lunch tomorrow ! and it really only took me around 30 minutes to cook i was skeptical , but i did it ! ! ! and trust me , i do not cook ! this is all pretty new to me and something sparked in me to start cooking , rachel ray was recommended and now i love her ! ! i think i 'll be purchasing all her books because i bet they are all just as wonderful ! ! i highly recommend this book to everybody and anybody ! ! i love the layout too i do n't have to look for sides because they are already there
this is a cookbook everyone should own my son who is normally picking loved the recipes in the book very easy to follow and have dinner ready in 30 minutes
great book and recipies however , i need more simple recipes i should have purchased 30 minute meals 1
i love her shows and so i got this book i really love the recipes and they really are as easy to make as she says the only think i do n't like is that a lot of her ingredients are expensive i just ca n't afford all the gourmet ingredients her recipes call for that really disappoints me because i just ca n't make a number of her recipes
so far this book is as good as the first one i love rachel ray and her receipes i am retired and have recently takes a part time job again and find these tips she offers to be super easy and very healthy
just love this girl and her cooking and the book just adds to her recipes
this cookbook is just like her tv program \( on the food network easy to understand and the food is very yummy ! \) or as rachael would say yummo !
my brother bought this cookbook for me 2 3 years ago for christmas and i have yet to crack it open you can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free \( but why would you \? \? \? \) after seeing some of her more recent episodes , i am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside her recipes scare me and i would n't feed half of what she makes to my dog do n't waste the money if you think you wanna try her recipes , print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire
i got this book as a gift and at first i was a little skeptical \( she is sometimes a little too creative with the ingredients on her show for my liking \) when i finally got around to looking through the recipes , i found myself bookmarking a lot more recipes than i ever thought i would there are fun recipes like fresh mozarella bites \( make sure to add a pinch of salt \) then there are some classic recipes like sloppy joes , however , she adds vinegar to the recipe , which i had never heard of and after trying the recipe would never add again \( i would also add a little less brown sugar than she calls for \) and the cream cheese mashed potatos are delicious all in all i would buy this book for myself if i had n't received it as a gift
i love this cookbook i try a new recipe just about every other night , and so far i have found only one dud it is fresh , has lots of taste , and delicious i also love that the book is set up as meals , so she provides the main course recipe and also recipes for sides and dessert to go with the main course there is a make your own takeout section , a healthy eating section , a fancy meals section , and a section of foods that kids will eat there may be other sections too that i dont remember the food is generally ok for you , but i modify a bit by using low sodium broth and skimp on some items she suggests to add to the dish also , i am on a budget , and ingredients required are very simple nothing too fancy or exotic expensive ! the best cookbook i ever bought ! but beware , it takes more than 30 minutes
it has some over the top moments but all in all a new
i thought this book was well worth the read i passed it on to my other mommie friends \( who drink \) and they thought is was good also there were plenty of parts that i could say yes ! that 's me and other parts that were laugh out loud funny and shed a tear sad this would be a good book club book for mommies
this is hands down the best mommy book i have read forget all the parenting magazines , forget all the girlfriend guides anyone who has become a mommy and wonders where the wild girl she was before went must read this book i listened to the audiobook and it had me in stitches thank you brett paesel for your brutal , raw , and much needed honesty
this is the funniest , best book i 've ever read about the thoughts and emotions of new mothers brett paesel has had the courage to publish thoughts that i do n't even admit i have even my husband , who endured my reading it aloud to him , enjoyed it and totally relates to the scenarios brett paints about her own husband
any adult can relate to the core story how does one resolve a decision your heart knows is right , but which threatens the rest of your being \? here , brett knows having a husband , child , and family was the right choice , but she 'd like a second opinion what follows is a story of a woman searching for the answer she knows it out there the answer that is , yes yes yes !
i thoroughly enjoyed this book it literally made me laugh out loud several times in fact , i lost track of how many times my husband kept asking me what was funny
i do n't have children myself , but i have several girlfriends with children the sweet relief i feel is knowing that the madness my friends experienced \( and i viewed with worry and concern \) is common and to be expected and , who knew , freakin' hilarious i finished the book in one day i could not put it down i lauged at every turn of the page i ca n't wait to read it again
truly affecting it 's a book that crosses genres as i'm not a parent , but i was consistently moved and often laughed out loud i do n't often find a book that is actually difficult to put down , but paesel keeps your attention with her insight and delicious wit it 's excellent
in a field littered with shoddily written confessional memoirs , mommies who drink stands out as an excellent book across the boards it goes without saying that it 's funny and topical , but there 's more to it than that i finished the book in one sitting a couple days later i picked it up and started again , paying close attention to the writing in addition to her deadpan hilarity and keen eye , paesel brings tremedous skill to the page there 's an economy of language and precision in the composition that strengthens the humor and pace , but also rivets the reader 's attention when she moves seamlessly from comic narrative to poignant observation in fact , the realizations offered flow organically from the comedy the one depends on the other i was thankful to discover that the book is completely free of cynicism and hipster attitude it is , instead , an open and big hearted book that is filled with sentiment , but not at all sentimental this funny , tender , expertly written memoir stands up to , and invites , repeat readings a sure sign of quality writing
loved this book not only the wry observations of what happened but the touching , poignant love of her children loved the quip about why do people think that not talking a lot when you 're in small town is a virtue zipped through it and laughed out loud
if you are looking for love , romance , witty banter and everything else that has made suzanne brockmann a hit do n't expect it from this book ! ! the romance is undeveloped , sparse and stale the suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt a great read if you 're looking for nightmares
i used to love sb novels , but the last few have been so very disappointing and into the storm is , by far , the worst there is no character development so we do n't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other basically , they 've known each other , at best , casually through work they sleep together having the most amazing sex ever ! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other hmmm , that may work at 17 , but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s they have very responsible , professional careers and by now , should know that love is based on far more than casual sex
i have previously enjoyed all of suzanne brockmann 's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction i have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances , i really hate it what a yawner and i would n't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated
excellent storey suzanne brockmann stays true to the contiuation of the navy seals have n't read a book yet by her i have n't enjoyed
ms brockmann is absolutely one of my top 3 authors this book delivers another great combination of story lines and characters the current and former members of seal team 16 are revisited and in fact pitted against each other this book focuses on mark jenkins , who has only been peripherally involved in some of the other books in this series also , there is a new installment on the relationship between sophia ghafari and lawrence decker who were the focus of a previous book
the pace was a little slow to beginn but picked up i could n't put the book down once it picked up and read it in 1 day seems everybody got wet at some point and time and the banter was out loud funny and shocking but when will we stop the short stories and get another book on sam and alyssa thats what i hungery for to pass the time this will do , pull out the past books on troubleshooters inc to keep up with whos whos
suzanne brockmann never disappoints her story lines are always original and her romance always steamy brockmann has built a family of characters her readers have learned to care about it just keeps bringing me back again and again to find out whose book will be next
this was a great book it has page turning suspense and some comedy this is one of the best books i 've read in a while i really enjoyed lindsey linds and mark jenks but izzy definitely added fun to the book
read this book you 'll know the reasons why people succeeded in the 20th , 19th , 18th century , and will keep on doing so in the 21st century their people skills , not technology
although the title does not quite do the book justice , this book more relevant for today 's business world than any in the past five years networking has taken on a negative connotation in the recent past , but ferrazzi shows how sincerity is the most important aspect of bringing people into your own network
i do a lot of networking around town it is often that i will meet people and share coffee with someone and then i will not continue to keep in touch with them in the book never eat alone keith ferrazzi writes about how to keep in touch with the people you know he has creative ideas about working your circles , having productive social gatherings , networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new
i thoroughly enjoyed listening to these cd 's they are full of good information and practical suggestions my husband and i both enjoyed them and are now hosting our own dinner parties
overall this was a really good book like any business book , you need to apply what you read , rather than just read it for the advice to work , and everything in this book will work the only reason for this not receiving 5 stars was the name dropping began to get a little old , at least for me i understand that it drives the point home about what someone who came from humble beginnings can accomplish through networking , but not everyone wants to hear every famous person the author is friends with and ariana huffington is the last person i would be bragging i had over for dinner
i 'll be honest , even though i chose this book myself i was very skeptical when i first approached it there is something in the title that challenged my status quo i am introvert and our society tends to value extraverted nature i was afraid that this book would repeat this extraversion mantra all over again , and i could n't have been more wrong , what i found was volumes of invaluable advice !
out of work \? stuck in a job you do not like \? stuck in a life you do not like \? then run out and get keith ferrazzi 's superb never eat alone ferrazzi provides practical how tos on expanding one 's thinking and , subsequently , one 's life , through networking
mr ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career he is an ivy league grad while i found some of his insights to be helpful , he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings while he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working class roots , mr ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page , writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club caddying at a country club is not a degrading , confidence busting job for a kid , working as a cashier at cvs is how does the cvs kid network his way out \?
i feel obliged to share my review of this book i got hold of it by chance and what luck ! like a lot of people i know the value of building relationships , because most of the best business i 've had have been from by circle of contacts however , i cringe at the concept of networking and fail miserably at trying to leverage my network this book however got me to understand the difference between networking and relationship building i wo n't spoil it for you , but once you read the book and understand the difference you will immediately change you view of building relationships that unimaginably augment your financial , professional , social and philantropic efforts
book 24 in the in death series
this has to be the best eve dallas book to date ! ! ! ! ms robb not only gets 5 stars for creativity , but for scientific accuracy what could have been a completely far fetched story was made chillingly believable by ms robb 's skill i also appreciated her ability to explain complex medical and scientific information in a way that was easy to understand a must read
good eve dallas vehicle with added futuristic sci fi elements characters remain strong and forceful yet vulnerable and human
while eve dallas and her partner peabody are interviewing a witness at the wilfred b icove center for reconstructive and cosmetic surgery , the body of dr wilfred b icove , sr is discovered due to the way icove was murdered , eve suspects a professional hit by the last person to come in contact with dr icove , a mysterious young woman as eve investigates , she begins to suspect that there is something off about dr icove 's practice , and when his son is found murdered in the same manner as the father , eve delves deeper into the doctors' pasts what she discovers not only sickens but shocks eve , who , with the help of her husband , roarke , intends to put a stop to a secretive illegal , immoral , and unethical scientific experiment that involves cloning
j d robb 's futuristic series starring eve dallas , edgy investigator , gets better with each outing this one brings back all my favorite characters foremost peabody with a riveting mystery involving dna and cloning and all things related that linger on the horizon i absorbed every page and , as always , eagerly await the next one
origin in death
i have read and been a fan of j d robb since i first opened one of her books several i have read as audiobooks and this one was as geat an experience as the others the reading of the book was well done and the voices excellent really adds to your listening enjoyment one of my favorite ways to take a car trip now is with a robb audiobook
as always , j d robb aka nora roberts gives a solid performance in origin in death the only negative thoughts i have on the book are that many of the events are clearly over the top with multiple clones and underground explosions usually the in death books reflect the gritty reality of 2059 origin in death was much more star trek than star wars \( the early years \) otherwise , a solid writing effort from roberts
lt eve dallas is catching killers once again in this installment of the in death series
most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses baseball is a team sport that captures the american spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game likewise , a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win loss talley in moneyball , michael lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game like real life , this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the sports page every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics there is the so so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game , or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the la angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy
this is a perfect example of edutainment at its best terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable it highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit , as opposed to how pretty an athelete is or how much charisma they have for people who believe that the usa is as close as any country to being a meritocracy this book is a shining example of just that i am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews i have read i ca n't wait for lewis to write his next book
money ball was a great book it shows that you do n't need money to win in baseball \( take that yankees p \) michael lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll , the oakland athletics , can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team lewis also tells the story of billy beane the gm of the athletics billy 's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the mlb he exerts his attitude as a force over the so called experts when a desicion must be made billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of he shows that there are many aspects of the game that we do n't know all in all , this was an excellant book my only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing jesse hartman
if you are a fan , this is a great read if you are not a fan , but just interested in the game , it is still a great read what i find most amusing are the baseball experts who poo poo billy bean 's approach to fielding and running a baseball team the proof of the pudding is in the eatin' and the cognocenti appear to dislike the taste the oakland a 's have been one of the stellar teams , yet , it appears that success is not what is important what is important is success based on the recipe that the experts write
how is it that the oakland a 's have won the al west in 2000 , 2002 , 2003 \( and are all but assured of winning this year , 2006 \) , as well as the wild card in 2001 , even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll \? that is the narrative that michael lewis uses to tell the story of his book moneyball one of the central tenets of moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued , can , with some specificity , predict certain players' performances in certain areas it is , however , only half the story , and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you , old news the real story that moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up lewis repeatedly describes how the old boys club of major league owners \( who lewis affectionately refers to as the women 's auxiliary \) , players , and journalists \( former cincinnati red and current espn commentator joe morgan is appropriately skewered \) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like billy beane \( the book 's main protagonist and current a 's gm \) , bill james , dick cramer , and others and on the old boys club the point is lost that objective statistics have the potential to give small market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players , the best chance of winning when people point to the fact that the a 's have not won the world series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years \( roughly since 1999 \) is when moneyball makes its point
i'm not a baseball fan hockey is the game of my heart baseball \? no way but , i loved this book the only other baseball book that i 've ever read that comes close to this high water mark is ball four by jim bouton funny and interesting in its own right a real joy to read
when i was growing up i devoured any book written about baseball as i 've gotten older , my passion for the game has waned though still a fan , i 'd not read a baseball book in several years until i finally got around to reading this one
field of stats
lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach , used by billy beane and the oakland athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of , primarily , on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers
this book was my introduction to sabermetrics , and proved to be quite a thrilling introduction the application of truly smart statistical work the game of baseball in billy beane and the oakland a 's had me hooked from page one great material
i have read all of the books in this series of precious and her adventures in the no 1 ladies detective agency the first book was not what i expected at all i am an avid detective and mystery novel reader
i really enjoy the authors insights into the minds of the characters the whole series is delightful and easy reading i hope there is another book in the works
the no 1 ladies 's detective agency are always uplifting books in their praise of the simple life lived by its characters in botswana in thisnovel , again there are a couple of mysteries that are cleverly presented and solved with the focus on the human beings behind the stories and their feelings the cases are what you would expect in real life as items that would need solving , but the presentation is what makes this series of books a joy to read
if you have never read one of the 1 ladies detective agency books , i highly encourage you to read them in order before you get to this one they are all outstanding , and introduce a variety of interesting characters who are all well known by the time this book starts
for years i was mystified by the popularity of seinfeld , the comedy about nothing nothing of any substance ever happened , and the protagonists were a bunch of shallow jerks the no 1 ladies' detective agency series adopts the seinfeld motif , but here we have a seinfeld of a superior sort nothing much happens in the stories , but the protagonists are a group of admirable characters seinfeld co worked through mundane situations with the hurrah for me , the heck with you attitude that scars so much of postmodern secular society in contrast mma ramotswe and her cadre of of friends confront the mundane with humble dignity and depth of character if you , the reader , can come away from the stories without feeling a deep affection and respect for mma ramotswe 's circle of friends , you are hard hearted indeed the success of the series can be attributed to the effectiveness with which alexander mccall smith mines the same comedic vein so well done in the rumpole stories large repertorie cast , engaging \( but flawed \) protagonists , dead on observations of the human condition , and all leavened with good humor and good will
the no 1 ladies detective agency series are each a jewel in their own right and this most recent addition is no different what lies within the pages of this book is the opportunity to be transported to the main character 's simple , wisdom , and curiosity filled life in botswana be ready to be transported on a great mini vacation when you read this book
one of the best things about alexander mccall smith 's entertaining no 1 ladies' detective agency series is that these are n't really traditional detective stories at all one must read between the lines to see that the amusing tales delve far deeper than solving simple mysteries and crimes each book provides an enchanting glimpse into the life and times of botswana and the series really serves as a clever study of human nature the loveable and heavyset chief detective mma ramotswe is clearly large and in charge , as her unique agency helps its clients and the stories' readers themselves discover many things they already know this charming series is excellent light reading and especially great for planes take the whole series with you to make a transatlantic flight go by in the blink of an eye !
mulholland 's text is a very readable and approachable primer about using scripture for spiritual formation one of the things i especially appreciated was his definition of spiritual formation that formed the foundation for his text he refutes those who want to use scripture or any 'technique' to become more spiritual for their own sakes mulholland points the reader to a focus outside of themselves he maintains that spiritual transformation must be for the sake of others and not ourselves
i came to this book with the advantage of having sat under dr mulholland in 4 5 courses including 2 on biblical exegesis the title of this book shaped by the word , is 100 representative of his view of scripture mulholland very effectively teaches us that we should approach the scriptures with our hearts and our minds full expecting to be shaped by the work of god through his word mulholland effectively communicates to us that when we always lead our study of scripture with reason our hearts will not be formed as god intends
mulholland 's insistance that we are capable of letting go of what we know in order to freshly approace the scriptures with the intent of allowing ourselves to be shaped by god 's word is the premise of this excellent book i lend it to friends , but make certain i retrieve it the author describes the path he has personally trod in his attempt to realize his full god given potential examples illustrate his struggle to distinguish the critical difference between the accustomed reading of scripture for information , and the life changing willingness to read for personal spiritual formation i am grateful for having discovered this fine author , and recommend this book to anyone interested in signposts to guide their spiritual journey
bought it because the author had compiled the book on buffett 's annual reports got really bored with this book however it is written too acadamic style and mostly a reiteration of graham buffet you will be much happy if you read intelligent investor buffets essay book
i believe that this book might be interesting for someone who is unfamiliar with value investing , but i must warn the more experienced reader that not much of new ideas are to found in this book what surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to convincing people that marekts are inefficient but what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place \? right anyone interested in this book can skip the first half the second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing my advice avoid this book and buy instead 'the essays of warren buffet' of the same author the latter is really a must read for anyone serious about investing
i am an 18 year old high school student who read this book for my economics class i have recently opened an online investing account and have been working hard to learn all i can about the market and how to excel in it i really feel that this was a great book for me since it covered everything about investing if you are just getting into the market like me , i definitely suggest that you read this wonderful book since it really does give you that extra knowledge about the stock market that others dream to have if you already know a ton about the market and investing , all i can tell you is that there must be something in this book that you will learn basically , here 's my overall view read the book if you want to be different from all the other investors who think they know everything there is to know about the market i also believe that this is a great investment of your money and time , since it is sure to help you in your future investments
this book is really disappointing , because it has very little to do with the title of the book it is a total waste of money after reading this book , you will hardly thing like graham and invest like buffett no chance ! read the first two books from hagstrom and buffetts letters to the shareholders dont by this one terrible
i learned more from this book than all my history classes it compresses the history of humans from the beginning telling facts using diagrams and maps it tells us how the human world evolved from nothing to what it is today
national geographic almanac of world history is a wonderful resource the chronological chapters , maps , time lines and introductory threads are easy to use a very nice addition to add to your library
as a reader i like to have quick reference books at my finger tips including a new version of the oxford english dictionary about 3500 pages long that i use almost daily so i decided to add a history atlas in the process of doing my research i read the other amazon com reviewers and then made three trips to two large book stores to actually look at the books and get a better feel for which was the best i ended up buying the oxford atlas of world history here are my picks and rankings
excellent work by patricia daniels and stephen hyslop for national geographic
this is a great read for anyone involved in any way with aviation from the pilots to feds , to managers and engineers the boeing company 's history is covered in a way that gives a broad view of nearly the entire history of aviation
the one percent doctrine by ron suskind , published by simon and schuster , 2006 , 367 pages , is a great piece of investigative reporting it goes in depth into the inside world of u s politics and policies before the table of contents suskind chose to put a quote from thomas jefferson , whenever the people are well informed , they can be trusted with their own government this quote serves as a good tone for the book the one percent doctrine is not a bush bashing book or something written for shock value , rather a book of information to help the american public by keeping others informed through investigative reporting suskind is continuing one of americas greatest constitutional rights on a time when personal freedoms are being questioned every day
this is a book that every american should read it gives previously unknown \( or little known \) details on the 'war on terror' among some of its revelations are
the one percent doctrine is a fascinating , chilling look at the war on terror from the viewpoint of those on the inside it 's unsettling , because it reveals the stark choices an open society faces in choosing to fight a war in the shadows it 's an accounting of the efforts of people caught by the tsunami of 911 struggling to come up with a response faceless bureaucrats , academics , politicos , intelligence professionals , law enforcement , the military , et al there are failures all too well known , 'successses' that were n't , and victories left unheralded
everyone should turn off their tv 's for a few hours and sit down and read this book simply the most informative book i 've read this year
very scary and enlightening we 'll drawn word pictures there was almost not attribution of information , though
the material presented in this book is absolutely fascinating while much of it has been covered elsewhere , there are details of the inner workings of the bush administration and the cia that are things that are unique to this book truly a fascinating read
ron writes another riveting story of 'the decider' aka gw bush everyone should read this book , particularly those who voted for him in 2000 and again in 2004 anyone with a logical brain and half history of the me region could anticipate that the foray into iraq was misguided at best and a breach of trust at worst america will need years to recover from this fiasco \( another fine book \) as well as all the lives and money squandered in this poor attempt at a war on terror
this book reads extremely fast the page layout is attractive \( just like the magazine \) , but alas this arrangement includes a lot of white space many of the tips are too familiar , e g , sprinkling lemon juice on your fruit salad to prevent browning , and some advice is applicable only to homeowners or parents \( i am neither yet \)
i'm a fan of real simple magazine , so this book hit the spot for me it gives you ideas for reusing items now i know what to do with the stack of dryer sheets that i 'd been saving there are inexpensive tips and lots of how to advice some may sound familiar , but there 's bound to be some you had not thought of before
i like real simple magazine but i do n't like saving the back issues \( i have enough clutter , believe me \) so the editors of this excellent magazine have compiled all kinds of tricks and ideas into this single volume it 's a lot of fun to read and has some very helpful stuff for keeping your home in order
nice illustrations and pictures makes this dictionary very interesting for kids it
i bought this book for two sets of grandchildren i had an opportunity to spend some time leafing through it with them the merriam webster children 's dictionary is , in my opinion , more than a dictionary , it is also like an encyclopedia it does more than define words it also uses great photos and illustrations to enlighten children and adults alike one could spend hours just randomly sampling the pages i'm sure it will be a very useful tool for the kids all through their elementary school years i wish i had this book when i was a kid !
i ordered this for my son who homeschools we are doing 3rd 4th grades combined next year and this dictionary is perfect for elementary reference skills he likes the colorful pictures and i think that the alphabet tabs on the page edge will be very useful to him when looking up words quite a nice book for the price
most dk products for children are outstanding and this is one of them well illustrated and comprehensive it is a large hard back , not a small desktop reference it is for third graders and up the type is small and hard to read for children in lower grades but my first grader loves the book because it is rich in features that fascinate him even though it is hard for him to read he enjoys the flag section in the back and he enjoys the first rate gazetteer also in the back
i highly recommend this as a first dictionary for school age children i purchased this for my first grader and she loves it ! it is compiled of great illustrations and filled with so much information she will use this book for years
this is a really good dictionary for kids gave it to the neighbor 's 8 year old , and she loved it it has lots of pictures and a pretty extensive vocabulary , so it 'll get used for years
this dictionary is indispensable for developing young minds who inquire at every turn , what does mean \? the beautifully illustrated , glossy cover advises that the contents include 32 , 000 entries and over 3 , 000 illustrations this makes it a great vocabulary resource as well as being down right entertaining for kids the pictures and illustrations are vividly colored , natural , not cartoonish , and very attractive
i have a 6 and 8 year old who love this book ! my boys are able to look up words and understand the definitions without it being too easy the illustrations are great too !
a lot has already been said about this novel , so i 'll address my review to those unfamiliar with mccarthy 's work if you 've never read mccarthy before , this is a great place to start the plot is tight , engaging , and easy to follow , and the language is gorgeous if you enjoy this book and want to move on to others , read the others in the border trilogy before tackling blood meridian
all the pretty horses is what i would imagine it would be like if ernest hemingway wrote a modern day western very rich language and vivid imagery , yet simple and direct dialogue not an especially complex plot and nothing unnecessary throughout , yet very deep emotionally i'm eagerly making my way through the rest of the border trilogy and finding mccarthy a little more verbose and allegorical in the crossing , but all the pretty horses has no wasted words in telling a fantastic story
dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather , the divorce of his parents , and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up , 16 year old john grady cole heads for mexico with his friend lacey rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen they find a hard , darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer cole is scrupulously ethical and strong willed , and he needs to be every time he shows love or compassion for another , he is made to suffer for it , and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere
i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph long run on sentences with no punctuation i was determined to try though once i got used to the almost non existent editing i was able to enjoy the story it is a challenge , but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life i'm not sure the effort was worth it , though note to writers employ editors so that your story is n't lost due to hard to read prose ! it added nothing to the book to create a new style and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead
all the pretty horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world his personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his west texas upbringing his lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill , he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest his journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness , moral dilemnas , and cruel lessons about human nature and survival the best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by mccarthy his style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags , punctuation , and quotation marks this book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering
frustrated authors take note , you can be published and you do n't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation , sentence clarity , story , structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story , however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher , who was either drunk or high or both , who thought what the hell , let 's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i'm sure people will buy it , after all americans do n't care about grammar anyway
when i read this book , i was completely impressed with the author 's power to draw you into the scene of the story i mean , i was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses and i 've never seen them in real life this book is very well written , and the imagery is powerful and moving
this , the first book in mccarthy 's reputation making border trilogy , is what every novel should be a good story told well
page 141 \( punctuation is as the author intended \)
i was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment first off it 's rare for such a new book \( it was only published 14 years ago \) to be a school assignment \( well at my school it is \) i suppose that says something for this book it 's the easiest read but not bad rather boring in places it leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which i did n't like so much , and i definably found the end rather rushed all in all , not my favorite book , but a good book in general
this book not only provides all the tools for a well balanced and in depth science technology based curriculum , but it is also quite informative on it 's own , and provides answers to many of the questions posed in other classes on a daily basis
author don soderquist , wal mart 's retired vice chairman and coo , writes passionately about the company its founder , the late sam walton and its corporate culture once dubbed 'keeper of the culture , ' he is not here to write a balanced , objective corporate biography instead , his admiration and respect for walton and wal mart shine from every line he examines the company 's workings from its humble beginnings to its rapid , phenomenal expansion soderquist describes wal mart 's commitment to its customers and employees , and describes its cost cutting zeal he details its use of new technology to revolutionize internal systems these insights from the inside are very interesting , but perhaps because the author was in the highest ranks of the company 's leadership the tone is so pro wal mart that it has the taste of public relations however , if you seek immersion in this distinctive corporate culture and want to emulate the principles that worked for it , we stand beside the big glass doors and welcome you to wal mart do you need a shopping cart
reading this book you get to know a humble , god fearing man who pursues excellence in everything he does don soderquist would never say so , but he is a great american and a role model for any young businessman
for me , this book was n't primarily about wal mart it was about a man who took his principles to work with him and became incredibly significant in a world severly lacking in principle driven living , it shines as a beacon here 's an example
wal mart is simultaneously admired , feared , loved and hated depending on from which perspective one looks at this giant retailer in this book , the author 's view is that of an insider , one who is passionately involved with the company 's growth for over two decades and who has lived by the core principles and beliefs of the company and finally reaching the position of coo and vice chairman
i guess i 'd better confess right away i did n't finish this book i only made it a third of the way before i was too disgusted to finish it i'm sure there are many useful things i could learn if i could choke it all down , but it was very difficult
outstanding book ! very challenging and encouraging to read describes the man who had a clear purpose and vision , was able to focus on it , and communicate and motivate his team around him in achieving success
this review is an adaptation of my review published in personnel psychology , winter 2004 issue
the ceo of seventh generation , jeffrey hollender , pens this book on responsible business i came across this book because seventh generation recently decided to sell their wares through target instead of wal mart most small businesses would love to be courted by the wal mart retailing giant but jeffrey hollender felt that target agreed more with seventh generation in this book , jeffrey discusses his thoughts on running a responsible business
i found the book to be uplifting it is nice to see this type of behavior being practiced we have entered a time in our existence where we have to start thinking of how we operate as an industrialized country
another leader of an iconic green company , jeffrey hollender founder and ceo of seventh generation \( yes , i use their laundry detergent exclusively \) discusses the challenges of running a business with high integrity and full disclosure in particular , hollender recounts seventh generation 's stint as a publicly traded company and posits that public ownership inevitably leads to an erosion of core values by the pressures of the markets he cites also the example of ben and jerry 's take over by unilever i personally believe that positive social change can be wrought through the public securities markets and that values driven investing is the most significant tool available
as a professor management who is interested in corporations acting more responsibly , i have just begun to use this book in my senior strategic management course hollender is a thoughtful and insightful proponent of socially responsible business each chapter covers a specific characteristics of srb \( accountability , transparency , sustainability , etc \)
this is an insider 's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility author and corporate survivor jeffrey hollender \( who wrote this with scribe stephen fenichell \) clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies , such as ben amp jerry 's and the body shop he covers the informal history of the corporate social responsibility \( csr \) movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible his presentation is heartfelt , if short on rigorous logic he candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises the book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible , but its yardstick is not clear for example , it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries , yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children perhaps starvation the book explores both the value of the corporate social responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions we recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business

provides overwhelmingly truthful information about america and the rest of the world it is a must read in order to understand all of the events taking place today
i doubt this book would have garnered so much attention had not hugo chavez waived it front of the un assembly decrying us imperial ambitions the book quickly soared to the top of most bestselling lists , and briefly topped amazon book sales i well imagine noam chomsky had to crack a smile , as it turns out that people do take notice when someone questions american authority , and this is what this book is all about
after accurately addressing the current state of affairs in the united states government , which can be called by many names chomsky uses polyarchy he radically reframes the last several decades of u s history in impressive detail , and his work is to be commended
this is the most lucid , convincing and rightfully scathing interpretation of american foreign policy i 've ever read absolutely brilliant
i was one of apparently many who went to the amazon website to look for chomsky 's book , once chavez recommended it i am familiar with chomsky 's reputation as a prolific writer of books on politics i 've tried to plow through some of his works on linguistics not easy , although the sense one gets as a non scholar is that he is onto something original in those works
i have always wondered about professor chomsky 's writings he has always been described as mean spirited and anti american by the right i finally got an opportunity to read his book hegemony or survival i was surprised at how readable it was i expected it to be overly verbose i was also surprised that i actually agreed with some of what he had to say , particularly about iraq he certainly is correct that the us led invasion of iraq was a fantastic opportunity for bin ladin to stir up anti us sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization i do n't think you have to be a professor to see that though although some have charged chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists , i failed to see this he condemns terrorism but accuses the us of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations
that 's how the rest of the world views him i agree
noam chomsky is one of the most noteworthy and influential intellectuals of modern times whether you like him or not , in my opinion , everyone should read his books in order to get a general yet very insightful view of current political affairs and their historical and philosophical backgrounds his unflinching motivation to unearth the truths behind many political events , bold character , and extraordinary ability to see and make sensible connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena is absolutely outstanding
i am not a right winger whatsoever , am against our involvement in the mid east but did read this book i ca n't say it better than alan dershowitz who commented about chomsky 's writing in general many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16
this book is not thick , and it has just the right amount of detail to balance the events here we follow carrie white , a bullied high school girl with a paranormal gift , sheltered by her religiously sick mother \( the first sin was intercourse , say it ! \) carrie receives an invitation from a popular boy to the prom , and of course , it is a cruel prank and carrie 's gift has the last laugh dark and demented , but shows how king is in a league of his own
king created a world where you believe in the possiblity of people like carrie white he looks at the situations from so many angles that you know everything there is to know and feel thankful for it
this is where the genius started his famous reputation and talent if had not been for his wife \( she saved the original manuscript \) , we probably woud not have the 1976 classic or anything else king related everyone shoud give this start of king 's genius a look
stephen king 's first book is well written , and he paints an image of high school that most will identify with \( peer pressure , bullying , interaction between very different social and economic classes \) the plot centers around a young girl carrie , and her struggle to fit into high school due to her extremely religious mother due to the movie 's iconic images , i'm sure most people will know what 's going to happen before even picking up the book still , it is an entertaining and worthwhile read
carrie is one of my favorite king novels , for it 's loosely based on his memory of two girls in his school who were picked on 'without mercy' i first read this novel in high school where carrie white 's character was unfortunately present i recall girls who were emotionally , and sometimes physically , battered by classmates and was once badgered by a bully myself this book is also part of the early 'raw energy' of stephen king as a writer , before he was launched into legendary status as a popular horror novelist though there is n't a happy ending in 'carrie' , i'm still able to sympathize with her character and see some justice in her wicked vengeance this novel will remain on my bookshelves , safe from any future garage sales , and re visited often
i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour , races , religions , nationality and creed \( all women are equal , in my eyes nigel \)
i began this book with a healthy dose of skepticism on more than one occasion i 've been involved in consensus decision making processes that were less than stellar \( as an employee , a board member , a community member and business owner \) in the hands of an unskilled , or manipulative , or misguided \( or worse , downright deceitful \) facilitator a so called consensus decision making process can leave you feeling like your pocket has been picked you know exactly what i mean when you finish the process and feel like you 've been hoodwinked into agreeing to something because
for anyone convening a meeting this is the perfect book to read in preparation great reminders and insights on how to create a safe place for inquiry and creativity as well as thoughtful decisions i found tips on ways to prevent and intervene when challenges to consensus arise particularly useful i love how it is organized and it is the perfect size for 2 hour airplane trips
working in and with groups and , at the same time , making progress can be an incredibly complex experience this book , though it demands a disciplined and thoughtful effort , will make a profound difference by its use having seen the principles of this work in action , groups are healthier and far more productive toward their charter members discover the patience to listen and the courage to contribute to others results that make choosing this path quite worthy
first , compliments to dressler for successfully resisting the temptation to unnecessarily 'inflate' the size of this book as a result , consensus through conversation is digestible during a reasonable length plane flight what makes it worthwhile to read on your next plane trip is this unlike many authors who are intellectually sound but lack on the ground skills , dressler is different he knows how to bring about sustainable improvement in organizational productivity even better , he knows how to teach others to do the same that 's what this book does illustrates why real conversation is essential to affect lasting change and then , takes us from ivory tower to ground level by producing a tool box of diagrams , tips , do 's do n'ts , and straight talk if every author packed this much value into 77 pages , we would all spend more time improving our organizations than reading about it thanks for raising the bar , larry
as a medical practice administrator , i found the approach described in dressler 's book as practical and an approach i intend to use for a tough decision i am struggling with , and wondering not just what 's the answer , but how do we decide between a number of less than ideal choices with big impacts and are we exploring the full universe of options \? i am excited about implementing dressler 's approach i believe its clarity and inclusiveness will not only produce a high quality decision , but will generate benefits well beyond the decision itself
there are going to be other reviewers who can provide more erudite reviews reviews better grounded in the study of cities or economic history i am nothing more than an average reader who enjoys non fiction
this is a very distinctive , well researched and argued book about how chicago developed starting with a standard model of urban economics the von thunen model of central place theory the author quickly moves beyond it the distinctive contribution of his book is cronon 's emphasis on how the roots of chicago 's remarkable development lay in the soil of its surrounding hinterlands he carries this argument further by examining how the transportation and communication revolutions of the 19th century the railroad and the telegraph created unique advanatages for chicago relative to other competitive metropolitan areas \( such as st louis , cincinnati , milwaukee \) and finally , how in turn , new metropolitan areas \( such as kc , omaha \) arose to steal aways chicago 's dominance
if you prefer your history to be the story of human beings , their struggles , and their triumphs , this book will disappoint cronon presents the history of chicago and the midwest as the history of commodities and trade it 's an interesting approach , and he shows the global implications of many of his insights he correctly observes that much of what he demonstrates with chicago could also be shown with other cities as well some of his insights did n't strike me as being nearly as unexpected as he seems to think they are \( the interdependence on commodities wholesalers and their markets , for example \) , but most of his ideas are well argued and supported ultimately this is not so much about chicago 's history as it is about using chicago and the west as a case study to show how cities grow , and how city and country are inter related
grain , beef , and lumber chicago became what it became not only because of its location on the great lakes railroad sytem , but also because of these resources this book shows how much nature influences human efforts it has few personalities because the exploitation of the resources was inevitable this is a great book for a greater understanding of how nature drives humanity
as a professional educator , it 's always great to review and reread the works of the great theorists such as piaget i consider him to be the father of educational psychology as well as a a great cognitive theorist
our school just started a school wide newspaper this year we joined nespa and ordered the reporter 's notebook for all 20 of our newspaper staff members it has been an excellent tool for the students to use for ideas , editing , etc ! as newspaper sponsor , i appreciated the usefulness of this book so much , i have ordered 20 copies for next year 's staff as well
we started a newspaper at our school , resurrection st paul , in ellicott city , md this past year mark has been so helpful in giving us pointers to get the paper off the ground the kids were so excited about having their own copy of the reporter 's notebook it did make them feel like real journalists and gave them direction and ideas i recommend it to members of any school newspaper
the reporter 's notebook is a great tool to provide to students planning on writing and publishing a newspaper the notebook provides several tips and ideas for young writers in a well organized format there are also several pages for students to use for note taking
i use the reporter 's notebook with the children in our elementary school newspaper club it is an excellent tool to teach the kids how to create great artciles for the newspaper we used the intervew section as a guide when we interveiwed teachers in the school i highly recommend the book ! the children use the book as reference tool , even in the middle school
i bought these for our staff on our elementary school newspaper the kids not only felt like real reporters with these the notebooks helped to keep the student reporters more organized and gave them guidance for writing their stories the reporters notebook was a worthwhile investment for the staff and i will buy more next school year
pages 38 to 97 half the book is just blank space for notes , which you could just as well write in a 10 cent , 70 page notebook spiral the beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms , with some bulletted questions here and there
mark levin 's notebook for journalism students proves itself an invaluable tool in journalism and media courses aside from pages of information to record sources , story ideas , and more , hints and tips are scattered throughout the spiral bound book this book is a must for any journalism student , or anyone simply interested in writing news stories
this calendar features some of alex ross 's best paintings and action figures , from january to december there is a year full of heros
to call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the genius alex ross is not presented in chronological order , but rather starts with the most popular characters superman , batman , etc , and then moves on to other work such as justice league of america , kingdom come , alan moore , etc
dc comics fans who love comic art collections must have mythology the dc comics art of alex ross it 's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters ross' art brought to life over the decades , from superman and flash to green lantern included also is ross' new comic book series justice , new sketches , and an oversized coffee table format which helps display and profile , in full color , ross' entire line of dc comics superheroes an original superman and batman story written by graphic designer chip kidd , a re telling of robin 's origin written by paul dini , plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover mythology appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own
got it as a present for my boyfriend he loved it really nice cover that folds out
i could n't believe , but mr ross did it again ! even better ! the second edition of the hardcover edition is even better than the first one ! the cover is already a gem ! you have to see to believe it ! not to mention the extra amount of pages of new art and updated material ! go for it ! aaa
this is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book also , looks great on a coffee table
this book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend ! she loves it , and did n't put it down all day after receiving it
more an inside in ross' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters beautiful boo
this book will astonish you even before you open it the jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of dc , superman and batman , and below the jacket you 'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every dc superhero battling versus their respective villains
this book shows there could be millions of minorities living in a stagnant way of life , where they 're not able to achieve or dream of the so called american dream i loved this book , i felt this book , this book is important and it should be read by anybody that cares for those living a life that 's unimaginable to many of us through everything lafayette and pharaoh were still children , i felt a lot of hope in this book through it all there was some kind of peace this is my favorite book from alex , i 've read his other book the other side of the river and there are no children here is his absolute best
one of the best books that i read this year there are no children here is about two brothers try to fit into there world these two brothers are deciding who they are the two brothers are lafeyette and his younger brother pharoah this book takes place in the chicago projects at the henry horner homes everyday these boys only see violence they see drugs , gangs , and murder lafeyette and pharoah mother lajoe talks to a report who is a writer for magazines the report ask lajoe can i talk to the children here she says there no children here as lafeyette and pharoah grow up they only have a mom so lafeyette is a father figure to his younger brother pharoah as lafeyette goes to his teen years he starts to hang with gang members and goes to jail a few times is lafeyette a good father figure for is brother \? pharoah the younger brother is very dedicated young man he will always put a 100 in no matter what he will never give up what will happen to these two brother while grow up in the chicago projects \? will they hang with gangs and do drugs or will they try to make it out of the projects and be someone while read this book you feel like you are in the story , you feel like you are the report write everything you could really see this really happen i enjoy this book because it talks about the real world that we do not see ever day
there are no children here
as referenced in the preface , according to the children 's defense fund , one in every three children lives in poverty in the city of chicago a remarkably higher rate than the rest of the country alex kotlowitz 's national bestseller there are no children here depicts the poignant and powerful story of two brothers , lafeyette and pharoah , growing up in one of chicago 's most notorious public housing projects , the henry horner homes although this is a story of hardship and tragedy , it is also a story of courage , hope and love kotlowitz chronicles the lives of pharoah and lafeyette as they confront racism and violence in their own community this extraordinary story exposes the fact that two parallel worlds still persist in this county and how inner city america continues to be defined by poverty and violence and is maintained by institutionalized racism and social inequalities
my god , who has no feeling for these very unfortunate people are heartless ba s american society flushes their poor and disadvantaged people away in the gutter the gap between the poor and wealthy is increasing all the time and something has to give great book and should be required reading for high school seniors
i would highly recommend this book to anyone the author provides insight into the lives of two inner city youth it makes you question our society and what we can do to help individuals who live in poverty poverty is not a choice but rather a sad reality that effects far too many of america 's youth please read this book ! it will change the way you think
to hardcore conservatives who believe that the plight of the poor is no one 's fault but their own , i say read this book to hardcore liberals who believe the poor are oppressed by society and not responsible for their situation , i say read this book there are no children here shows that life is more complicated than either extreme the lives of the people in this book are governed by complex interactions of both personal choices and unavoidable bad luck the author sympathetically examines the terrible hardships his subjects were born into , but never shies away from showing how their situation is perpetuated by the harmful behavior and relationships they choose to pursue whatever your ideology is going in , you will not look at poverty the same way after reading this book
i think that the 'reader 's' comments below about thomas sowell were helpful and i just wanted to add one more thing
this book takes you through so many different emotions kotlowitz does an amazing job weaving this documentary novel together it opens the eyes of suburban america this book inspired me to teach in the inner cities a must read for anyone going into teaching , public service anyone with an interest in the social fabric of disadvantaged america
what a joy it was to read this book , and another of fischer 's books paul revere 's ride written in narrative storytelling fashion , the book moves briskly but with urgency i will save the long reviews for the top 500 writers here at amazon , but i found this book to be extremely satisfying what 's more , not only does fischer illuminate washington 's determination to keep the idea of liberty alive , he also writes about the tremendous help given the continental army by locals who continued to harass the british throughout the winter as british foraging parties searched for food for themselves and their horses
david hackett fisher 's washington 's crossing is a wonderfully written and research history of this seminal event in american history i was admittedly hesitant to read this work , pulitzer prize and all , as i felt the topic a bit narrow for my tastes and it perhaps a bit too much like a high school history lesson luckily , i was very mistaken
i eyed washington 's crossing for a long time before finally purchasing it meanwhile in the past couple of years i read ellis' his excellency , george washington , and mccullough 's john adams and 1776 although i am by no means finished reading about the period and its individuals , i have gotten a wonderful education in the lives and times of this era all of these books complement each other and washington 's crossing is the crowning piece that ties much of it together washington 's crossing is very pro american and pays homage to washington as a great man and leader revisionist and alternative views of the making of our nation do not have a place here instead , the author focuses on the best ideals that made the united states great such as respect for individuals of all stations , a willingness to listen to the views of others , flexibility and perseverance in adversity and changing situations , the placing of the good of the nation ahead of one 's advancement and glory , and decency on the field of war as a historical record the book is outstanding and tells the story from both sides the british are not a faceless and evil enemy , but a group of largely decent and capable people trying to do the right thing from their perspective we americans should regard ourselves as fortunate in having them as our mother country and the basis for our own institutions the various battles and maneuvers of the new york and new jersey campaigns are described in detail , but not in a minute , mind numbing matter , and the result is fascinating history many maps are included that will aid the reader in understanding the action the book contains many appendices that provide much added and incidental detail that the reader eager for more knowledge will enjoy washington 's crossing is a keeper for a lifetime and now sits on a bookshelf awaiting my return
as a veteran of both the united states army \( field artillery \) and militia \( national guard \) , professor fischer 's story makes one proud to have served in the same army as george washington and those brave men who tramped through the snow and freezing rain
fantastic , exciting true tale of one of the most well known legends in the history of this country only , it 's not a legend dr fischer goes to great and convincing lengths immediately in the book to make this point clear i have no problem with revisionist history , as long as it brings to light the uncovered or supressed details of what we hold sacred as historical truth this book is revisionist history in that fashion , and it reinforces the facts behind the legend with his excellent reference list , and his ability to place the reader at the site of the drama of the events , this book is a believable and authentic narrative of what happened during this pivotal and desperate year in american history
i 'll start by saying that it took me only three days to read this book , cover to cover i could n't put it down ! exciting narrative , well researched , and a must read for everyone
part of the oxford pivotal moments in american history series , fischer 's work is a cultural history surrounding the events that washington 's revolutionary army participated in from march of 1776 to march of 1777 , with the middle of the book focusing on the pivotal turning point of the unlikely capture of the hessian garrison in trenton , new jersey on christmas of 1776 , made famous by the painting featured on the cover of the book
in my quest to increase my understanding and knowledge of the american revolution i came upon this book by mr fischer it was well recommended so i took a chance i hope all my future gambles in life turn out this good
i join the chorus of admirers of this wonderful history of the events leading up to and including the great battle the crossing was indeed a pivotal , crucial moment in american history it is no stretch of the truth to enumerate this as one of the 10 most important moments in our entire history although washington deserves the credit for his extraordinary skill , nerve , and leadership , fischer 's re telling is an amazing feat of fascinating , page turning detail about the ordinary soldiers who overcame enormous obstacles to get to trenton , much less to triumph over the shocked hessians , and their valiant leader , who bravely succumbed to mortal injury we cross the treacherous delaware with the intrepid americans , trek with them across the snows , hurrah with their surprise attack , and follow them on to further victory historian or lay person , this is a book you must read to learn of this little skirmish that eventually made america a world power fischer has done a masterful job we come away just that much prouder to be descendants of these at once ordinary and extraordinary americans
this is just a tremendous piece of work i 've read a lot of focused revolutionary war items and to say that some are readable is a gross overstatement this reads almost as well as a good novel
especially young ones i have now been a vegetarian for five years and rarely use this book any more but it was great when i was first starting out lauren butts was sixteen when she published this book and the recipes are all geared towards kids in that age group both in simplicity and taste
though i am 23 , older than the intended audience , my mom bought me this book as a present i was thrilled with it lauren butts has created a fun and easy cookbook for anyone i love the layout of the cookbook , it is divided into sections , and i enjoyed her nutritional info in the front of the book maybe it will inspire more teens to go veg i found this cookbook full of great meatless recipes i must warn strict vegetarians and vegans however , that most recipes contain dairy products , or eggs there is a great recipe for nathan 's blueberry breakfast cupcakes , that is easy to make and tastes like store bought however when i tried to get my three year old neighbor to eat one , he refused in horror other recipes that i have enjoyed making include apricot chimichangas , thai tofu veggie wrap yum , burrito roll up , veggie pitas \( tastes the same as wendy 's veggie pita \) , layered nacho salad , mock caesar salad \( in case you did n't know , caesar salad dressing is typically made with anchovies fish meat \) , chilled berry soup this is a fabulous recipe i made last summer when berries were plentiful , it is totally tasty and makes a great meal , tasty flatbread pizza with artichoke hearts ! ! this pizza was so unbelievably tasty , i have always been a bit wary of artichoke hearts , they just look kind of disgusting you know , but i was so shocked to discover their delicious taste ! ! veggie quesadillas were also fabulous spaghetti pie is indeed a great dish , and i like to make it when serving non vegetarians it has been a hit with everyone so far tofu mcnuggets are the absolute bomb these recipes are only a fraction of the great ones in this book i would highly recommend it to parents of new young vegetarians , or college students like myself who do n't have that much time to cook some have opined that this book is full of recipes that are fattening , but i think most know , that us vegetarians are a mostly lean lot , and i can personally attest that the recipes are n't fattening thanks lauren for creating a great book , it is indeed an oasis as far as veg cookbooks go its great to have a cookbook that is n't full of really long , hard to find , expensive ingredients
i personaly know the author of this wonderful book i went to a camp with her that helps for college credits she is very intelligent and i have tried the food in this book it tastes really good the book is well thought out , easy to read and perfectly set up for any teenage vegitarian i gave a personal review before it was published , so i do recomend this book to any teenager that is willing to cook
i must admit iv always been a clinton fan especially for the part he played in the north of ireland i thought the book was well written and gave an interesting account of the good and bad sides of the american political system the book gave a great incite into the man himself and what it takes to become president
bill clinton writes a very interesting account of his life in an inviting conversational style his story telling approach easily draws the reader into the events of his life i especially enjoyed the amount of time he spent discussing his childhood he expresses the pain and isolation that he felt very well he is a talented communicator and this comes through as he tells his story the words flowed one after another and i was easily captivated by the details this review actually refers to the audio cd unabridged version , part i however , after 21 cd 's for part i alone , i did become tired of all of the drawn out explanations and wished i got the abridged version overall , it was a great book and i am going to also read part 2 it provides insight and apology for the actions of our ex president he seems to have written it to make amends with those he offended
why did i decided to listen to an autobiography , i still do n't know , autobiography 's have never interested me before \? however , bill clinton 's autobiography , articulate and exceedingly detailed , was the exception
well written , good book interesting to read his perspective on world events different from what i was seeing in the media
president clinton 's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries it frequently appears as though the brief , daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added it does provide an extensive recap of president clinton 's life events , so if that 's of interest you may want to check it out
i read this book with some skepticism at first since the initial reviews from the pundits were lukewarm but i must admit , it is a riveting account of late 20th century american politics , and what it takes to rise to the top clinton 's narration comes across in a natural , easygoing style , and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed this is a serious account by clinton , about his strengths , weaknesses , and most importantly , his capacity to forgive his enemies his early childhood experiences , especially what he learnt from his grandfather , seem to have made a major positive impact in his life this , and how non racist his folks were even though they poor , southern folks from the 1920s era , armed him with that all important teflon coating needed in politics
the cd version of my life is the perfect companion for a long road trip several reviewers have observed that the 900 page book is too long , but the abridged cd version cuts some of the detail and covers the major events of his life in six hours while listening to clinton 's smooth southern accent i felt like i was sitting on a porch in georgia listening to a fascinating person recount the highlights of his life and what he has learned from them highly recommended
i never appreciated this man while he was president or victim of a scandal from his own weakness ! yet after reading frkurt messick 's excellent review , i gained valued insights into the inner life struggles of bill clinton after a few chapters into his years as governor of arkansas , he solidly attributes his salvation to his wife and family i doubt that he can justly objectify his personal status when he endeavors to separate his constant external and internal struggles !
when fernand braudel originally published this text in the sixties , he became a pariah at the sorbonne in retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that banned in boston came to embody previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history braudel 's was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis it captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations , sacrificing only the detail outside the themes even subsequent to a history of civilizations , other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original and do n't be tempted to skip the soft introductory chapters with titles like the study of civilization involves all the social sciences , and the continuity of civilizations these tee up the hard topics , like the greatness and decline of islam there 's method in braudel 's approach , and it takes patience braudel 's translator , richard mayne had his job cut out for him the complex syntax is that of a french intellectual of the sixties , and it is retained in mayne 's text , but you become accustomed to it do n't look for maps or photographs in this penguin paperback the text alone is six hundred pages there 's only one other book in this space , from dawn to decadence , by jacques barzun in my view they are complementary
very poor analysis of west african civilizations for example , ghana was a very significant soninke empire in western africa , yet barely any attention at all is paid to it to make matters worse , the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been founded by whites from the north fact is , there were no whites to the north the only light skin berbers nearby were mixed race browns
i was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas , but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students a history of civilizations satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book
if you want a better understanding of how the world has come to be what it today is , then this book is a good first step in so doing braudel was an influential french historian specializing in the mediterranean , so his insights into the evolution of europe are more insightful than other regions he highlights \( but he is insightful throughout \) excellent book to read while you bask in the sun with your feet dancing in lake michigan on a tourist beach \( as i did \) maybe the atmosphere i had while reading made me enjoy it more nonetheless , one should read this if they have any desire to
this book is extraordinary ! meant for french lycens in their last year before sitting for their bac exam , it was a failure however , looking at today 's situation of the west vis vis the islamic and other non western worlds , it is a jewel among other things , it explains the origin of today 's conflicting attitudes for example , why the egyptians and other mediterranean peoples become in overwhelming majority moslems several centuries after the conquest by the arabs
man , you ca n't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied i liked the way they presented the idea of bw , but it was seriously outdated they should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year
anybody buying this book to learn some bw will be very much disappointed like the way the book is organised but older stuff i ca n't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book not only they should stop selling , also should recall the book
this book is great since all the step by step instruction is accurate this book is for sap consultants who have little knowledge of sap bw concepts and would like become a sap bw expert the only thing that i saw lacking is for business explorer query options there are very few examples for business explorer but however , i think if you play with the gui this problem is overcome easily this book is worth it ! !
as title suggests this book is step by step guide i think author has assumed you already have knowledge of sap bw concepts it walks you through steps on how to create infocubes , load data and create queries and workbooks its extremely useful for people who are thinking to self train themseleves in bw area not meant for expereince bw people
secured packaging prompt i would do business with them again
in the introduction the authors tell us that the purpose of the book is to provide snapshots of daily life if you have ever been to italy you know that they have a different notion of what it means to live every visit that i have every made to italy there has been a general strike that has taken place the first time i visited italy this fact mystified me now , i just know that this is what happens and i do n't let it bother me
this slender volume reads fast a comprehensive study of italian culture is beyond the scope of this book the authors have arranged 74 brief points about daily life in italy , alphabetically by subject , so the reader does n't know what is coming next if you look at the sample pages available here , you will get a sense of the leaps we begin with an explanation of the italian version of april fool 's day , followed by four paragraphs on table manners , and then we 're on to attracting attention , and so on from the very way it 's organized , we are clearly in the realm of entertainment , although the information is accurate and certainly useful there is a dusting of vocabulary , but it 's not a course in italian for travellers i found it a delightful and fascinating read
this book offers true , informative facts about italy and the italian lifestyle in an easy to read format it 's a great read for anyone planning a trip to italy or for anyone simply interested in this magnificent country
i am a international student for understanding and using english naturely , i have read a lot of grammar books so far , my all of english abilities speaking , writing , reading , and grammar are not good this book is really helpful i recommend to many international student !
i have used this outstanding book with international students for several years , but it would be helpful if the answer key were available from amazon
with this book is it possible to learn the english grammar
i definitely would n't change these workbooks \( a and b \) for other advanced english grammar workbooks if you want to master grammar in order to top a toefl or tesl exam , i really recommend it the examples are extremely easy to follow the only problem is that i prefer a one workbook system anyway , my five stars go to betty azar 's grammar book
i did n't know that this grammar book is composed of volume a and volume b after i recieved this book , i realized that but i guess there is combinated one also , you can buy combination with work book less than regular price be careful , when you buy this book , make sure if you need just volume b
it is not only my favorite book but also my index , because i just study one year by myself of this book and i 've got very good skills especially in grammar so i 'll recommend anyone who likes to learn enlish fast to choose this book so just look at it one time and i'm sure you 'll like it , blieve me !
pranab chatterjee wisely cautions us to remember that there are ways of expressing nationalism that differ from the western models with examples from literature and history the author helps us explore the inner spiritual or cultural world of bengalis in colonial india , a world they tried to keep safe and distinct from the outer world of british imposed politics the writing in places is a bit vague , but the reading is worth the effort to remind us that wisdom does not begin and end in the west
even though l m montgomery did not intend anne of green gables to be a series , she still captivates with her eager readers in anne of avonlea
how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said
being a l m montgomery fan helps of course , but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the anne of green gables which started it all the writing hold true to the author 's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series my wife and i have been reading these books for years and never tire of them again , as with her first work , you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time this particlar story starts where the last left off , anne is sixteen and her adventure continues i , for some reason , find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly

this is just a wonderful sequel to anne of green gables it deals with anne 's life after returning to avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college seeing anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad it is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the avonlea village improvement society \( to which there is some resistance from the avonlea elders at first \) anne is still of course a kindred spirit , but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures \( which was is just a touch sad , but as mr henderson says , all things must change \) for anyone who liked the first book , this is sure to not disappoint
it never ends , luckily ! ! ! i will never tire of anne 's wonderful , lively imagination in this story , anne is sixteen , with lovely dark red hair , gray twinkling eyes , and only seven freckles ! anyways , more happens in this story than a change in appearance anne becomes the avonlea schoolma'am , and loves her students like crazy , especially little paul irving , who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher anne and marilla even adopt little twins , who also win their love but when diana barry and anne are wandering down the lane one evening , they stumble upon the lovely miss lavender she has the same imagination too ! well , everything in this story is just as perfect as it 's prequel it 's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels in this case they 're both great
anne of avonlea was almost as good as the first anne book it is about anne 's life as a school teacher in avonlea marilla adopts two mischievous twins and mrs rachel lynde moves in so life is never dull for anne at the school house or at green gables you could read it on its own , but i recommend you read anne of green gables first
i read this book when i was 12 and loved it now i'm 21 and recendly read it again , and i liked it even more the plot is great the characters are alive , and the writing is superb a must for anyone that wants to laugh , love and cry with the town from avonlea
i stayed up all night reading this book , not only because the info was so good but it is extremely humorous and entertaining i recommend this book to anyone who cares about their dog
i bought this book as a last resort on how to deal with my gsd malamute she was a horrible mannered thing lol now she is better behaved and minds three huge cheers to joy tiz for her awesome book and understanding of what makes a dog tick ! ! ! ! i also keep on on her websites for more info as i go along going to write another book joy
joy actually understands dogs and temperment i can not believe how many books i have read that were written by people who did n't have the slightest clue what made dogs tick
i bought this book eventhough i own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious bridget jones 's diary \( the book \) is equally as funny , it differs slightly from the movie but not too much , this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of bridget jones it 's a very well written , quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time i recommend it to all
there was a lot of hype surrounding this book , with the movie and all , and after reading , i have to say , i fell in love with it ! ms jones is the perfect chick lit heroine and she made me laugh so many times ! a book that is this good is a rare treat , so do n't pass it up if you have n't read it yet ! along with it , i also recommend heartbreaker by kim corum , another good chick lit book
bridget jones , modern day woman , brillant and does n't know it , prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them
if you have n't read this book it 's a must it 's a classic early version of chick flick this is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it 's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90 's still a national best seller it is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet \( is n't that all of us \) in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 hilarious or is it \? a droll sense of humor , a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too do you want to lose 7 lbs , stop smoking and develop inner poise well see how bridget does or does n't do all of that in bridget jones diary fast summer read great airplane reading , fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids , food , family and chaos ! good re reading too keep it at the summer house for guest
this book is funny no one can doubt that the reader can truely feel the joy , the sadness , the hope , the loss , the success and the failure that bridget jones feels from page to page the movie is , indeed , hilarious , and to some extent better than the book do not expect flowery writing styles like that of maya angelou expect a more simplified style , such as that of meg cabbot \( although more 'adult , ' as it were , intelligent and thought emotion provoking \) expect a good page turner , which keeps you rooting for the character to find the perfect sex god who will love all fluxuating 131 lbs of her and keep her mother quiet all at the same time most greatly , however , you wish nothing less than for her to be happy with the bridget jones that you will grow to love most certainly reccomend good summer or plane ride rea
all women have their problems , but for bridget jones , with her seemingly permanent single life , for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about , her habit of drinking a little too much , and her trouble with her weight , which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down , the poor thing just ca n't seem to catch a break
i rarely like a movie better than the book but it seems that sometimes a director knows when to cut out unfavorable aspects better than a book editor this was still a very good book and i highly recommend it
after seeing the movie , i decided to pick up the book this book proved to be very funny , as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many , many women her age face today fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true , often serious real life topics \( being single and not liking it , infidelity , betrayal \) and is yet able turn it into light , funny reading that takes talent , in my book in the wrong hands , this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read \( in light of the above topics \) you cant help but root for bridget
go buy this book you 'll read it over and over and laugh every single time bridget jones is my hero she tries so hard to be perfect but poor thing , she is like the rest of us woefully insecure and less than perfect
in this short work by manly hall , he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of plato and pythagoras , however , the principles are generally the same silence is still of utmost importance in the times of pythagoras , silence was not only a virtue , but something your life depended upon today , you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society , however , your integrity and will are disseminated silence today stands as a virtue more than anything , but one that most people neglect this short book also looks into the practices of the student , disciple and initiate , as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school even today all of these attitudes that hall speaks about have complete practicality in today 's culture it is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner if one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book , surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible , but inspirational for those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time , this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with
this is a pretty exceptional book there are three major strengths of the book from the perspective of shaara 's writing ability
even if you do not read historic novels you will love this one the author lets you see inside the characters so it is history book that is nothing like the ones you read in school
this novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason it 's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details the commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps shelby foote 's brilliant \( non fiction \) trilogy the movie gettysburg was based on this novel if you love historical fiction and the civil war you must read this fantastic book the author 's son has made quite a career \( jeff shaara \) out of writing a series of novels based upon this one before and after gettysburg \( which is the setting for killer angels \) unfortunately , in this instance , the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned steer clear of the jeff shaara books and read the non fiction histories instead but , if you need a good great civil war novel , you 're likely to find no better one than this
for history buffs , students and civil war fanatics i would advise them to read this book and then see the movies gettysburg that was made a few years ago the books is about as sharp as one can get when covering the horrors of war the characterizations are very sharp as and the story telling from the beginning of the battle to after its end is about as accurate as it comes sometimes one can actually see the action and often it is disturbing this novel should be required reading in high school and college history classes
this is a gret read for anyone who is a civil war or history buff great character developement , plot , rate overall an easy read about a topic which has an overwhelming amount of information if you liked gods and generals , you should enjoy this one
i bought the book while in gettysburg and read it nonstop on the flight home it 's a quick read and will definitely keep your interest i highly recommend the movie gettysburg as well , and having read the book will provide deeper insight than what a movie can do above all , visit gettysburg , as touring the sites and seeing the terrain will make the killer angels come alive it did for me
this is a great book , which i would classify as a historical novel i read it before i went out to gettysburg \( along with all the two others in the series , which are just as fabulous \) i love the civil war and work in archives cataloging many actual civil war letter and artifacts however , to someone who was not too interested in the war , history or is younger this might not be a good book for them nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories in the book , expect many reports about troop movements \( war is 99 boredom , 1 sheer terror \) expect lots of inner monologues , speeches , and flowery language because that is how it was in the victorian era \( it is the truth i have read enough letters to prove it \) i can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books i have read but it is not for everyone as for the movies based on this series , gettysburg and gods and generals , they have to be the most boring movies i have ever seen , just awful read the book over watching the movie
i wholeheartedly recommend this historical novel to anyone interested in learning about the civil war in fact , i recommend this book to anyone not interested in the civil war this is the first civil war novel i have read , and i was completely captivated michael shaara gave life to many of the key figures in the civil war 's most famous battle although , much of the interior dialogue is fiction based on historical documents , the details of the action stay true to history shaara provides amazing insight into the essence of the war , the cause , and provokes a feeling of kinship with officers from both sides of the battlefield
there are not enough words in webster 's dictionary to describe all the feelings one experiences while reading this book
this is an excellent book if you are interested in writing horror it takes you though each aspect of the genre step by step the exercises in the book are useful too i recommend this book to anyone interested in writing horror
i 've been writing since i was 15 but i 've lacked the initiative and experience to finish a story , now that i 've read writing horror i 've done the exercises and finished a few stories i found the sections on the seven steps of plotting and the five ways to open a story immensely helpful the exercises and advice are geared towards short story writing although there 's a few helpful hints about book length fiction throughout the book van belkom stresses how hard the publishing industry is , only those who stick it out will make it in this business also of note , being a fellow canadian it 's refreshing to see a writing book told from the perspective of a canadian author use this book to write a story and renni browne 's self editing for fiction writers to edit it into print i ca n't recommend this book enough
you know you 're in good hands when you open this book but it takes more than just an incredible set of credentials \( bram stoker award , several novels and over 15 anthology appearances \) to be an effective teacher it takes a broad understanding of the writing craft and business , and an organized approach all of which van belkom has with this book it 's a fast \( 216 pages \) , informative primer for new horror writers , and perhaps a nice refresher for the pros covering all the topics a book like this should , such as composition , marketing , and the current state of the genre , van belkom is at his best when he dissects his own stories and experiences for the reader 's benefit i'm just disappointed he did n't give us more more meat , as they say if you 're still in the i'm embarrassed i love horror stage , writing horror has a flexible , paper cover that 's perfect for folding over when you 're on a crowded subway
about 20 years ago , i bemoaned the lack of heroes in our society the anti heroes , the good bad guys had taken over and there were only the ones you love to hate in the spotlight cormack mccarthy wrote the first volume of his trilogy around the same time and i found some of the heroes i 'd been looking for mccarthy has n't created his cowboy heroes , he communicated or maybe channeled them it really seems to me that like some of the ancient storytellers , he serves as a medium for the ancient voices that is not meant to minimize mr mccarthy 's talent no one has been more successful as he in capturing the language and personalities of real cowboys
incredible one of the best novels i have ever had the pleasure to read mccarthy is a master story teller i have never read a book by him i did not fall in love with
in recent years , a lot of people have noticed that book clubs demand a lot of books no surprise , but the next conclusion is that the taste of book club audiences influence what gets published i think this is why we have books like the devil wore prada that are soon followed by prep this is why people who read evensong soon pick up brick lane and the liars club my wife belongs to a book club they have read all of these books
i usually read every night to my wife we 've gone through dozens of books together in our marriage , and several months ago , i read all the pretty horses to her she loved it , and would not let me read her anything else until we had read mccarthy 's entire trilogy we just finished it
cities on the plain is the final volume in cormac mccarthy 's border trilogy , a loosely tied together trio of novels that deal with life along the u s mexico border this novel focuses on the protagonists of each of the first two books john grady cole from all the pretty horses and billy parham from the crossing now the two of them are working together on a ranch in new mexico in the early 1950s
this final installment to the border trilogy , like the preceding volumes , stands on it own , but stands on it 's own less than either of the other two
being a fan of such authors as j r r tolkien , h g wells , and c s lewis , i figured i 'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the american west , a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining
this final novel in cormac mccarthy 's border trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes mccarthy has developed throughout the trilogy in the first novel , all the pretty horses , mccarthy stresses the romanticism of john grady cole , who runs away to become a cowboy , suffers a heart breaking loss at love , and returns , sadder and perhaps wiser , to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains
read this book at a light warehouse because you will not want to be anywhere near the dark !
it is one of my favorite stephen king novels i 've ever read possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books it is extremely long and i must admit that i had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it i know it 's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long
when i first read this book , upon finishing it i immediately proceeded to rip it 's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces that was how much the story affected me it disgusted me , it disturbed me , it moved me after brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head , and if that 's not the mark of a great writer i do n't know what is i then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again
although i'm only 14 year old boy who lives in utah , i 've been a die hard stephen king fan since i was twelve , and i have to say , this is really the high light of his career
wow , what an epic
a book that enables you to travel back in time back to 1958 , back to a time when there was stan , mike , richie , bev , eddie , ben and big bill and some others back when some kids' main concern was avoiding henry bowers !
the book has a wealth of information on a number of chronic disease processes and alternative medicinal treatments the section on arthritic diseases contains much valuable information for instance , dr null explains the many benefits of chelation for capillaries and general wellness chondriatin sulfate is helpful for both arthritis and osteoarthritic conditions
once again gary null phd recycles information into another gn book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements gary null is probably the only author that carries a phd and fails to reveal where he got his ba , ma and phd a quick reading of quakwatch com shows that gary null has nontraditional credentials and owns a multi million dollar supplement company he also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters
my grandmother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer 's disease this crippling disease was robbing her of her memory and daily life now , 2 years after her diagnosis we discovered gary null 's get healthy now ! this volume functions as a valuable tool to reverse her condition and take back her life we have followed null 's natural , healty regimen and have witnessed remarkable results she no longer struggles with this debilitating condition we are grateful to gary null and his work my grandmother can now enjoy everyday pleasures as she once did
let me first say that i am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book i am extremely committed to healthy food choices , environmentally sound policies , and all the basic values gary null ostensibly embraces i have no problem with null 's basic premise that we should consume a fresh , non processed , plant based diet \( although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier \) , buy organic food when at all possible , and avoid toxic household products but i am totally outraged by gary null 's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues i bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points we do n't need any more evidence that a plant based diet low in trans fats is healthier than eating at mcdonalds this book adds nothing legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source , and is far inferior to , for instance , the food pharmacy by jean carper , in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce
i eagerly awaited this next installment of the artemis fowl series would eoin colfer handle success and continue to put his best effort forward \? yes ! this book exceeds expectations i recommend it to all ages if you like humor , a fine plot deftly woven , beautifully written prose with a philosophically rich sub plot this book is for you
it was great can not wait for his next boo
artemis fowl is back \( finally \) ! i was terrified that my favorite irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author eoin colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old artemis but , fortunately , the boy genius has n't been forgotten he 's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high tech fantasy series
this is by far one of my favorite series of all times it far surpasses hp in my eyes \( i know , blasphemy , right \? lol \) i love the twist on the ending and the set up for the next book \( there will be a next book , right \? \) a must read for anyone who enjoys the blend of genres and eoin colfer
the 7 day detox miracle was written for those who know that a yearly detox is just one step on the road to wellness most doctors acknowledge that many illnesses have their origin in the gradual accumulation of junk and gunk in the liver , kidneys , and bloodstream what authors peter bennett and stephen barrie have done was to write a text that is somewhere in the middle between a primer for the layman and a more advanced text for serious students of medicine and health they devote the first seven chapters to a scholarly yet readable theoretical explanation as to what a detox is , what it is not , why we need one , and the various lab tests that allow you to optimize and individualize a detox program the part of the book i found a needed warmup for the actual process itself was the authors description for a dedication for a week long task that may disrupt one 's life style for that week essentially , they recommend that one ought to take a series of tests prior to the detox that range from chemistry screen testing to acid base ph testing and to oxidative stress testing since these tests require the intervention of qualified health care professionals , it makes sense not to act precipitously without outside help once you know what shape your body is in relative to potential toxic excesses , then the program as outlined in this book not only makes sense but is seen as a necessary treatment either to eliminate these toxins or to make sure that you never get them
i am almost finished with the book , and although i have not done the 7 day detox yet , i am very excited about trying it this book was very informative as well as easy to read and lays out the 7 day plan for you i also like that they give you suggestions for before , during and after the detoxification i ca n't wait to try it
my girlfriend and i both felt the need to do some cleansing and heard about this book through natural cures they do n't want you to know about we started it on a saturday so we could do the water fast on the weekend very good idea i was amazed how i had not problem with hunger and even though i have to watch my blood sugar level there was no problem we felt so great when we were done this is something i think we will do at least once a year
of course i want to restore my mind and body ! the title alone made me want to read the book however most of the miraculous claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study those who are skeptical of traditional western medicine might enjoy reading this however , i found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you too good to be true usually is
i do n't know why this awesome book has negative reviews here it is a little difficult true but for a new yorkphile , like me , it ca n't be beat , if you want to know new york in the 1920 's , and to a lesser degree the nation all the familiar names are covered scott and zelda , woolcott , parker , gerstein stein , freud , jazz and ellington among many others new york as a huge rush for outsiders from their first sight the skyscraper boom , and builders and architects the movie industry the extreme dangers of transatlantic flights , and coast to coast mail deliveries the harlem renaissance , basically the city as a reinventing , percolating tornado fdr , damon runyan , irving berlin , web dubois , singing the blues , mary pickford , babe ruth , jimmy walker \( the fun loving mayor with questionable morals \) the great white way , the cotton club it is just about an endless ride thru this great town in the 1920 's and beyond , including the aftershock of the 1930 's sometimes a little difficult , but you can browse through the index too and find hundreds of worthy subjects to check out one of the best journeys through a time and place that i know ! ! also with some interesting photos too
this book is a waste of money i received it as a gift so i could n't return it it is full of historical mistakes and careless errors it is not worth taking the time to point them out
i agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts the book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics , society , religion , politics and of course physics have affected each other \( it goes both ways ! \) through out the ages furthermore , the author nicely illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes have also changed through the ages \( i e , the age of reason versus the renisance \) this book left me with real insights as to the nature and limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics things are not as they seem , my friend ! lastly , the author displays an appreciation for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put down at times i never thought a math history book could be a page turner read it
for the reader who just needs a gentle boost to get atop the masks of nietzsche , this book will enable you to appreciate sophistication that you may not have even known was there not coffee table material , but palpably attractive to the discerning mind
what a great book ! 420 pages , hardback , and every single page is worth reading , not one page is boring you just want to keep reading and keep turning pages !
i 've read quite a few of nora roberts 's books and this was the only one on which i had the complete 'wowzer' reaction i mean , seriously wow this is a book full of content , with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks , reading and rereading it to get it all ms roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the olympic rain forest the characters are likable , and believable , and most certainly not your average roberts book livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as noah could be a persistent annoyance and readers will find themselves grieving for julie macbride along with jamie , rob , val , david and livvy herself and there 's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling
when i started reading river 's end , it reminded me of a remake of the o j simpson murder it is a story centered on a little 4 year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father years pass by and the story unravels olivia 's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy written in the ingenious nora roberts style i have grown to truly enjoy , this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the olympic rain forest through olivia 's eyes i guessed the villain about 1 2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as i could never be 100 sure i was correct i would highly recommend this book to everyone
in river's end , nora roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years a story of hollywood 's glamour gone astray , and the young girl who survived it but this is n't a typical plot by any means , not with roberts' doing the writing she guarantees many unexpected events along the way !
some may not consider this one of her best , indeed , it is n't listed as a fav anywhere , but it had enough nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything i could there after
my first nora roberts' book with only be persistent did i complete the book found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
i could n't put this book down it was so good it was such a surprise because by reading the inside cover it does n't sound at all good but i gave it a try and i'm glad i did it 's definatly become one of my favorites this year the story comes alive for you
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger , them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning , and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it , but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of ms roberts
a good compendium of advice for individuals , managers and investors alike , who want to prevent themselves from being hoodwinked by corporate fraud
this book changed the way i invest it is a must read before putting your money on the line
jim cramer gets it right this book is one of most valuable i have ever read in terms of helping me invest my money and i 've read alot it teaches the reader what to look for to make sure they are investing in good sound companies and not the enron 's of the world it is one thing to find an exciting stock , it is another to have the confidence to know that you are n't getting swindled this book gave me that confidence
a great read going through the last 100 years of corporate fraudsters the authors really make history and the characters come alive through their storytelling they also bring out amazing parallels among the frauds and show how people could have spotted the dangers before they lost everything good lessons to know and to keep in mind for the future a great book
i listened to the cd version wow !
vince flynn started his series of mitch rapp books about a decade ago actually , the first book he wrote was n't even part of the series , but all of the other ones since have been all of his books have a political element to them , and all of them are thrillers written with a take no prisoners protagonist who kills first and half the time does n't bother asking questions later they 're all long , and as flynn has continued to write the books have gotten longer of the four i 've read in sequence , the lengths were \( in order \) ca 430 pgs , 480 , 530 , and 670 those are approximate , but about right he 's actually getting better , though , something that happens to these guys sometimes
i enjoyed the novel very much mitch rapp is an excellent author , but he needs better proof readers i could not believe the number of errors that i noticed as i was reading i would love to offer my services , but i do not know where to make that request i did go to his web sight and found an email address but no response from it i taught high school english for thirty eight years and read thousands of essays for seniors this is not the forum for this complaint , but i know no other thanks dale b hage
his best one yet ! mitch rapp gets turned loose in this one the bad guys get what 's coming to them at home and abroad
i 've read all of flynn 's books in fact , i just picked up act of treason as i'm reading it , i'm reminded of how disgusted i was with his last book , consent to kill , only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one
perhaps it 's political intrigue which interests if so , vince flynn 's consent to kill is now in paperback and provides a thriller based on modern headlines and terrorist concerns mitch becomes the target of an international conspiracy for his struggles to preserve freedom consent to kill shows his evolution from hunter to prey as he 's stalked by dangerous , unseen forces for his past 'crimes' an outstanding and engrossing leisure choice
vince flynn changes up the chase and instead of mitch rapp being the hunter he is now the hunted
although he 's been publishing books for a little while , i still tend to think of vince flynn as one of the new faces in spy fiction compared to folks like lecarre , clancy , higgins or deighton , flynn is a youngster , but that does n't mean he ca n't hold his own against the veterans in fact , compared to tom clancy \( who in certain stylistic ways , is probably who flynn is most similar to \) , flynn is actually the better writer in consent to kill , he again delivers a high caliber , fast reading thriller
well , the previous 2 books were showing that mitch was losing his motivation to be dirty harry superagent and they were mostly action and no further character building
the mitch rapp series gets better and better with each installment ctk was great , very difficult to put down the story was definitely more emotional than it has been in the past , which really took it to a whole new level i ca n't wait for act of treason to hit the shelves flynn 's writing is leaps and bounds better than his first couple of books he has really come into his own as a writer 5 stars here is a no brainer
as a professional health specialist i have read extensively about natural progesterone cream and hormones since my diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001 and have been using it since that time instead of the drugs and radiotherapy recommended by my doctors dr lee 's work is remarkable but you must read carefully otherwise you will be under misapprehensions like some of these other reviewers who are still making mistakes about the difference between natural progesterone and synthetic progestins ! they are molecularly different and natural progesterone does not carry the same side effects or risks that the synthetic ones do ! i am the hormone health expert for the cma and bio vitality limited where we also advocate hormone testing so that you do not supplement if you do not need it ! it 's really what the doctors should be doing before they give out hormones of any description
dr lee is not an ob gyn be careful when reading this book recend clinical studies are not included in this book
thank you , dr lee for your book ! i was on a calculated plan of natural progesterone for approximately 8 months which corrected many of the issues brought on by synthetic progestogens contrary to what some people are writing in their reviews , natural progesterone is not the same as the synthetic progestogens found in birth control pills or ru 486 , nor can natural progesterone be used at the same amount each month or forever i , for one , cannot use synthetic progestogens because of the problems they cause leg cramping , sleeplessness , mood changes , blood clots , weight gain to mention a few dosage of natural progesterone totally depends on physical , monthly needs of the individual woman some months , a little more , some months , a little less , and always under the guidance of physicians who understand and support the use of natural progesterone hurray to those who bring this information to the forefront and are not slaves of the pharmaceutical companies
this book brings to life a survival struggle that is often hard to fathom in addition to the sailors story the author adds interesting information on a variety of topics including history , science , geography book is worth reading
this story was incredible ! some of the things these men had to do to survive were truly inhuman and at times appalling even so th ebook is engaging from page 1 to the end amazing what the mind can do to keep the body from dying and what it can do to make the body give up this book had me angry , relieved , amazed and at all times entertained i highly recommend it !
an absolutely spellbinding story ! hard to believe the hardship faced by the crew of the commerce this book made me become quite interested in the sahara , on which i 've read considerably since
this was a really , really good book and a true story beware , though , the first 50 pages are slow do n't worry if you ca n't keep the characters straight you will keep the main ones straight shortly enough perservere the slow beginning , and the story is well , well worth it
shipwrecked and held captive by muslim slavers , this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down i have deliberately not read the ending because i do n't want the experience to end with every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive , because they are christians and therefore dog dung is beyond human endurance their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book i have ever read of this genre i am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience
i'm an avid reader of real life adventure stories , especially ones that bring out survival instincts in the face of tragedy and deprival this is one of the best true stories i have ever read dean king brings to life the historical background of the shipping industry in the early 1800s , the adventures of world trade by sea , and most of all brutal slavery and daily raw survival in the sahara desert every imaginable horror occurs to the shiprecked crew and yet many of them make there way to eventual safety incredible
the food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the sahara desert in the 1800 's they also endured slavery , starvation , intense heat and thirst , and the strange customs of their captors but like any good adventure survival story , the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture this book 's vivid portrayal of life in the sahara and the communistic principles of the bedouins that live there is riveting reading by the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their muslim captors indeed , both the reader and the sailors become victims of the stockholm syndrome , whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor , despite your own travails
the story of the 1815 wreck of the american cargo ship commerce is a gripping and heroic tale of survival and a tribute to the human spirit this book will grip you until the final page and leave you exhausted and amazed at their ability to withstand a seemingly hopeless situation
the pure scope of the brutish horrors these men endured is a wonderful look into the human spirit and the natural will to survive many of the men never returned home , but for the ones who did , this was a complete and ultimately satisfying portrayal of survival
history has always been an odd beast to me , i must say what is the goal of an historian , precisely \? can one man really summarize the actions of thousands of men and bevies of political machinations among other things in a six hundred page narrative \? does a static past really exist \? such pressing concerns , you see
more than a simple historical treatise , it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history a classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history thucydides is unmatched in his insights , clarity of language and thought , and in his informative description of the history of his time a must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos an enjoyable read for any historiphile
i had studied greek history for quite some time before i finally did myself the greatest favor thus far in my life and purchased thucydides' account of the peloponnesian war for my collection at the time i had already read herodotus at least 3 or 4 times in full , along with all sorts of other greek texts available i was in love with herodotus , enjoying with skepticism his regaling of myths as fact , particularly the presense of oracles and their relation to the events he described , which still fascinates me in spite of the doubt i feel towards divine intervention at that point i had known of thucydides at some time , but it was not until i had exhausted almost every available source of spartan knowledge did i at last turn to him
i really have the feeling that i am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work instead , this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text
this book illustarted how greek people were disunited and enagged in war with one another at the end of this book , author mentioned how persian iranian were commenced to interfer in greek politics
thucydides \( c 460 c 400 bc \) was an insider during the peloponesian war he was an athenian commander who was dismissed after his men lost a battle in spite of the fact of his previous successes this book was an attempt at an honest historical assessment of the peloponesian war which was not only destructive to the athenians and eventually the spartans , but the war was also ruinous to their allies the important theme of this book is that athenian hubris replaced practicle thinking leading to athenian imperialism and war
why should we take an interest in a war that happened four centuries before the birth of christ \? it is because this disastrous 27 year war between athens and sparta had a major impact on the development of the western world it finally ended in 404 b c e , and recent evidence suggests that athens finally succumbed not to force of arms , but to typhoid the result of the war was to put an end to hopes of greek unification , and it was only a matter of time before the weakened greek cities would fall victim to foreign conquest and lose the freedoms that were the vital essence of greek civilization , and their greatest gift to the world the triumph of spartan oligarchy over athenian democracy left a long shadow over the development of western civilization
thucydides' the history of the peloponnesian war is a wonderful source for any thoughtful study of ancient greek history i'm proud to put this copy on my book shelf next to homer , herodotus and catullus , all my favorite ancient writers thucydides writes for what is the first time an objective historical work this , along with herodotus , is the birth of history yet there are a couple of troubling problems with the translation for one thing it is full of cold war lingo that makes it hard not to draw connections from athens and sparta to the united states and the ussr phrases like reactionary elements are out of place and do n't mesh well with the actual greek in addition the translator uses the word empire for the greek word arche now my greek is n't the best but my dictionary tells me that arche means province or territory , or literally a place that is ruled over empire has a lot of strong emotions attached to it , and its not a good translation for arche hence the translator adds an element that thucydides did n't intend when he uses athenian empire besides those elements it 's a great translation
few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece this is one of them
i first discovered sean steward in perfect circle , which is his best book to date in my not so humble opinion this one comes close though in this book , like perfect circle , stewart writes in a way that is very readable and occasionally drops in such clever and well written phrases and sentences that i actually stepped back and appreciated the writing skill as well as the story that is not to say that you lose your immersion in the story , and it is not to say that he is wordy or pretentious just the opposite it is prose that is a delight to read
go to the look inside the book function above , and click on excerpt that takes you to the first page of sean stewart 's mockingbird \( you can also get there through the intro pages links \) read the first paragraph if you 're hooked , like i was , you 'll love this book
this book is top notch , the character development is fantastic and the story so real that it turns into a roller coaster of emotions top notch
i really enjoyed this book , zombie frogs , voodoo riders , and all the perils and tribulations possible while being pregnant when i was n't pregnant yet after getting pregnant , though , man , it 's really funny and it 's really obvious that the man did some real research into the problems mockingbird is more easy going than some of stewart 's other books , warmer , funnier , and much more involved with the everyday things that go with someone 's life with all the complexities , absurdities , and joy that goes with it it still has that touch of magic he brings to everything , and i highly recommend it
left handers know they have it tough in the world , but for all those non believing right handers , this is the book you need to read it is a thorough examination of left handedness , including word origins , derivations of left is evil myths , famous left handers , relevant anatomy , historical and cultural concessions to right handers , and even a list of retail stores who cater to southpaws very well done all the way around
i really liked left is right because it provided excellent information for lefties , ranging from humorous anecdotes and helpful history to easily understood explanations for why people are left handed and lists and lists of famous lefties right on ! for this special book for lefties
i enjoyed reading rae lindsay 's book i really like her writing style it was a light read and anyone interested in lefties should read this book !
it 's about time someone wrote a great book for us lefties ! wow ! this book is so fun to read and is so informative that i would recommend it to anyone yes , even right handers ! you ca n't imagine how much cool and interesting stuff is packed into this book

this book is usually listed by free market advocates as one of the five books to read first henry hazlitt writes with unequaled clarity he outlines that basics of many fundamental ideas the price system , inflation , government subsidies , minimum wage , and others he uses pure logic and reasoning almost exclusively , only providing statistics as sidenotes to the main point however , the book 's strength is also its weakness while he makes a tremendous intellectual defense of free market economics , it by no means complete i would recommend this to any beginning libertarian or free market advocate it will provide many strong points for further contemplation and research however , a keynesian advocate will still be able to question certain ideas yet , any intellectually honest statist should read it , because hazlitt does present his arguments cogently , clearly , and with power one note a more seasoned free market economist may wish to consider this book a medium priority , because it may be somewhat basic to someone familiar with classic arguments
this book offers a very clear description of a subject that most people find dry and boring instead of referring to countless graphs and charts , hazlitt manages to explain his assertations using common sense and language that a non economist can easily understand this is that same format of the monthly newsletter 'ideas on liberty' , published by the foundation for economic education , which aims to improve the understanding of economics among laypeople \( the foundation has long been a supporter of hazlitt \) one interesting thing to note is that hazlitt was not formally trained as an economist , and i believe that 's one of the reasons that he is able to state all these concepts succintly with no confusion even more amazing is that the same policies that he speaks against and that have failed are being tried again , with nothing more that a different name and some other minor changes for those who think economics has to be confusing , i wholeheartedly recommend this book
i do n't go into the plots of books when i review them as many have already done so i always look forward to another james lee burke novel , and pegasus descending does not disappoint dave robicheaux is one of my favorite protagonists a man who is not perfect , has his weaknesses , but always tries to do the right thing
one of the best writers of environment and character descriptions , burke just gets better and better to the point that i can smell the air after a rain storm in new iberia thanks to the way he puts it colors in his landscapes come to life in my mind 's eye as though i were there
i loved it recently took a trip to new orleans , and a side trip to new iberia to see the area he so fondly writes about
no one paints a better picture of south lousiana than james lee burke jlb creates a wonderful canvas of louisana politics , wildneress and attitudues i am a michigan native that now lives in south lousiana and have fallen in love with every book he writes this book , like every other robicheaux novel , has left me starving for more do n't you love books that you hate to finish
as near as i can determine , i have read everything by james lee burke that is in print though his prose continues to captivate me , his latest novel is not one of my favorites i am confused about how both dave and cletus are portrayed , and dave 's relationship with his latest wife also baffles me i plan to reread this book after some time has passed \( as is my custom with all of burke 's books \) and see if the problems i think are there have been resolved by some subconscious mental wanderings in the interim
i always know what to expect from burke and his protagonist , dave robichaux i am occasionally disappointed by the plot sameness of it , but the quality is always there
i have read virtually all of james lee burke 's novels , and this one is right up there with the best of them highly recommended
james lee burke ! anything written by him is a joy to read , but i especially love his robicheaux novels this one is no exception i anxiously await his future novels his writing is pure poetry i recommend all of his books try to read the robicheaux novels in order you wo n't be sorry for the money or time spent on burke 's books
a highly recommended book
of all of the self help how to prosper books i have ever read eker 's should have been the first it is the quintessential foundation of prosparity
i bought this audio cd looking for that one new concept that changes the way i think about money risk living in general i found many more than one , plus i 've listened to it 3 times in the two days i had it , audio cds are great for that ! if your looking for business ideas or investment advice you 're not really going to get it here i did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means \( as an investor , one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property \) a great real estate investment book the is weekend millionaire 's guide to real estate investing and the mindset book \( amazing books ! \) he talks about the mindset you have to have to take the actions despite of your fears futhermore , he elaborates on the following your thoughts determine your feelings and your feelings determine what you do doing translates your desires , visualizations , etc into reality the biggest thing i got out of this book is the following warning i already know that is what most people , especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and do n't further educate themselves in a topic rich people are always learning and applying what they learn if you have read 1000 books on money , investing , whatever you want in life and you do n't have the results you want its two things one , you 're mindset is not right for that task and you don't understand what those books were saying if you did understand , you would be taking all the actions spelled out and like science your life would reflect them \( cause and effect \) notice how i said you and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation great book , add to cart !
harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be , and i was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end and found out there was nothing just a worthless rant
loved the book so much , now my husband and i are going to his 3 day seminar
eker has to be respected for his accomplishments the transformed mind has to go before the transformed bank account but , my personal preference is the exhaustive and more systematic presentations that brain tracy makes eker is probably a very motivating speaker ! having said that he gets 4 stars because it is a classic book cd it needs to be in every millionare library
never received the book , so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost i have incurred
i received this book the next day and i tell you i could not put it down it is the most inspiring , the most intriquing book i have ever read great job on the book
exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago i also attended the guerilla business school , a 2500 intensive
i cannot claim to be an expert in the wealth creation literature outside the us , but i am inclined to think that the principles are the same everywhere
this excellent book deals mostly with the many ways in which nafta is ruining all the countries involved although the description of the problem seems fairly accurate , the book disappoints somewhat by not mentioning some stronger cures , the strongest and most corrective of which is socialism
i suspect that many americans might be intimidated by the title of this book americans are told not to think in terms of conflicting class interests after all , most people are supposedly middle class critiques of the wealthy and powerful are seen as expressions of envy , or of antique stalinist , hippy , or new deal thinking in my opinion jeff faux does us all a valuable service by trying to revive the debate about the political nature of our world and its implications for our current lives and for our future his writing is energetic and fresh this is no dull social science text ! at the same time , he presents a lot of evidence in making his arguments , reflecting thorough and careful scholarship this is no simple partisan account for example , chapter seven on nafta presents is hard hitting in its critique of the alleged benefits of free trade , but the reader gets the feeling that faux is basing his analysis on what his data revealed about its complex impacts on the majority of americans , canadians , and mexicans overall , whether you are in america or armenia , you will be entertained and provoked by faux 's writing
the title appears borrowed from sam marcy 's original work in 1979 on the global class war and the destiny of american labor , but then , no one wanted to listen in the 1970 's , when i did my first master 's degree , to the three major themes in the political science literature
a well written book that confirms books i was writing \( till my power supply blew out \)
from a george bush perspective , i read hence , i must be a revolutionary but for me reading is essentail in rafael 's book , scaramouche , the establishment games the system by dueling the people 's representatives with their skillfully commissioned swords they literally kill the people 's will today 's fait accomplis are the skillfully commissioned penned instruments called nafta and wto the perpetrators behind these instruments were a political crew of bloodsuckers on the american side they included robert rubin , bill clinton , alan greenspan , lawrence summers , al gore and henry kissinger these penned agreements were inserted with poison pills designed to adversely effect constitutiions throughout the world , including ours but you 'll never hear a discouraging word about them from the corporate mainsteam news get the real down and dirty of globalization and read the global class war read it and weep for those you had placed your trust in , and to the republic they signed off on learn to distinguish between the interests of stateless transnationals and we the people whose economic fate is bounded by the nation the poor class has already lost what little they had now the middle class is in the cross hairs and slowly being squeezed out unfortunately , they have taken us all aboard their hellbound corporate express called the bottom line a must read for those who want the truth
faux has done a really smashing job in bringing many threads into a coherent picture the witless rightwing reviewer who invoked hayek , von mises , etc , wretched wonks of the right and economic darwinists all , did not even know what book he was reviewing typical of the right the idea of transnational elites , who screw their own countrymen , is not new the way in faux ties this to comtemporary economics , social movements and politics , is different and far more perusuading than the usual the aliens have taken over the elites junk available today
explaining their own economic self interest to blue collar , redneck republicans is a bit easier than explaining geometry to gophers all it takes is infinite time and patience this book makes a valiant attempt to educate redneck republicans
the author believes that france 's economy , and socialism generally , is admirable this , against all evidence to the contrary really , how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take \? have n't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas \? as socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot \( and rot \) , we are expected to heed calls to admire , and replicate , their failures amazing read hayek von mises sowell friedman this guy , here , should never have been published
i find this book just a bit disjointed its main thesis seems to be that the fafta agreements were basically a fraud perpetrated upon the american worker by a global elite mr faux sees a class war going on with this global elite \( who he calls the 'party of davos , ' from the town of davos switzerland where a conference is held each year \) operating to their own benefit to the harm of the american worker
according to jeff faux , erstwhile president of the economic policy institute in washington dc , with the enfeebled nation state and the absence of world government , the 2 , 000 plus people who manage and own the worlds largest multinational corporations meet every year at the world economic forum in davos switzerland to set the agenda for the global economy even though the event includes political leaders , academics , journalists , and an occasional movie star , they are mere window dressing accompanying the real movers and shakers this elite is what faux calls the party of davos there is no countervailing party other than the world social forum which celebrates the likes of hugo chavez and fidel castro , but they are of no consequence in the real order of things
for a dog behaviour professional , this book and its companion volume have to be the most useful and important resource around not for the casual dog owner , but then that 's not the target market a wealth of material , well presented and organised , and without bias now when 's the one on behaviour modification coming out \? \? ! !
i would give this book five stars if it were n't for the level of difficulty in reading it just had to take off a star for that reason alone this is n't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer it 's a serious book for the well versed student of dog behavior and training mr lindsay definitely knows what he 's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the concepts behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material it was a good read that i had trouble putting down , though ! if you 're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training , the book is well laid out and informative to the max
absolutely amazing full of clear , well outlined and detailed information , much of which i had previously not known or failed to appreciate its significance and relevance even a professional could benefit
i wish someone could have given me this book when my daughter was born in june 2005 i had a hard time finding information that deals with specific issues relating to babies with down syndrome
i had recently found out that my future grandchild was diagnosed with down syndrome and was anzious to start educating myself the book helped me understand the syndrome and realize that we need not be afraid of what the future holds since then i have found out that this baby will probably not go full term , but what i read made me realize that i should not be afraid of hearing down syndrome in the future
i was given a copy of this book when my son , zachary was born as another reviewer mentioned , it was quite scary reading all the things that might be wrong with him medically , along with the quotes from parents the author included i'm sure the quotes were a well meaning inclusion from the author but each and every one i would review to be extremely non descript , even bordering negative as a parent of a child with ds i can tell you first hand that my experience has been nothing but non descript but overwhelmingly positive my son , at less than 2 years old , has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others a child with down syndrome is a blessing in disguise he give to me so much more than i give to him as you wil hear from just about any parent with a ds child but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book
as a professional i found this book to offer a lot of basic information that a family could understand about down syndrome all the children i work with with down syndrome , their families have this book and said it helped them so much
i received a copy of this book from my son 's occupational therapist i was ready to know more about my son 's condition and to know why he would do somethings instead of others i wanted to know how the milestones varied from healthy children i felt this book covered everything that i wanted to know and even discussed what to do when writing a will and how it changes with a down syndrome child things i never would have thought would be different until reading this book it took about 4 months before i was willing to read something about this because i wanted to start raising him just like i raised my other children this was definitly a book that did not go the extreme in the condition which is something i wanted i would definitely suggest this book to anyone who has a child with down syndrome
i am an early interventionist , working with several infants and children who have down syndrome i found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading for example , it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children this chart caused no end of worry to the parents i work with more accurate , down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere
i was given this book by the richmond down syndrome society when our daughter was born with down syndrome it was quite a shock as we did not know she would be born with ds i knew right away when she was placed in my arms \( i'm a special education teacher \) and within 20 hours of birth she was whisked away to the medical college of virginia this book was so very helpful to both myself , my husband and my family we all learned so much from it and we passed it along to my brother \( her guardian in the event something were to happen with us \) and his wife they also found it helpful as they knew what to expect overall , i cannot stress enough that these children are so wonderful in their own way and this book helps to give you an inside view of what to expect with your new baby
we were told , in the delivery room , that our son had down syndrome that was not what upset us , it was the pediatric specialist telling us all the bad things that would happen to our son we were desperately looking for information on d s , but nothing was really clear that we saw on line our doctor at child development had this book so we went to borders and got it it is written in a way that makes it easier for someone to understand all the possibilities basically , a d s child can do anything as long as he she has the opportunity and support our first hurdle was the v s d , he had heart surgery at 4 months as he was unable to put on weight or even keep the weight he had gained he has gained 7 pounds and is 7 months we play with him all the time in ways to develope his muscle tone and his p t says , in one month , he has done a major improvement we cross each bridge as it comes but we make it fun we constantly us the book for reference when we have a question or need a clarification , it is always on our kitchen table
in the delivery room when my son mikey was born , we were told he had down syndrome we knew very little about the condition and were confused and frightened about the future our son 's geneticist gave us a copy of this book and it answered almost all of our questions , including some we never thought to ask the information in this book relieved many of our fears and showed us how to be the best parents for our son the book starts with a forward by ann m forts , a member of the board of directors of the national down syndrome congress the new hampshire developmental disabilities council and the president 's committee on mental retardation ms forts also happens to be a person with down syndrome right away , we knew this book was going to be positive ! the book starts with a chapter on what is down syndrome followed by a chapter on adjusting to your new child chapter 3 discusses some of the medical issues that are associated with down syndrome this is good information to be aware of even if you never need it the next few chapters discuss taking care of your baby , family life , how your baby will develop , early intervention , and educating the child with down syndrome the last chapter covers your legal rights every chapter has several pages of short quotes from parents it helped to lessen the fear and stress to read that other parents are coping this is by far the best book for the new parent of a child with down syndrome before you read anything else , you will want to read this book

jean shepard contributed to our culture with the stories that resulted in a christmas story he 's hard to dislike , for that work alone
and watch them live it this spring i was introduced to this book by my high school english teacher 30 years ago it was hilarous then i have just given it to my own 16 year old son in gleeful anticipation of him living the prom ritual this year
i made the mistake of reading this on an airplane once i almost had an aneurysm trying to stifle my laughter this is a book that you 'll read over and over only , be forewarned you 'll have to buy multiple copies once you lend it to a friend , you 'll never see it again
this little gem of a book will have you chuckling outloud based on his life , author jean shepherd spins yarns of past loves , family vacations , top playing , and the awkwardness of growing up in a less than privileged part of town you will connect with some stories , shake your head at others , and burst out laughing at most
this is one of the funniest books ever written jean shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern indiana the time is the late 1930 's to 1940 's there is a sensible mother , a good hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words , and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine we begin with the arrival next door of the bumpus family , slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero 's father into explosions of outrage we go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes wanda hickey to the high school prom i laughed so hard that i difficulty reading shepherd 's mastery of description of small town america in the 1940 's is a pleasure to read , and it never stops being outrageously funny
it was the summer of 1967 , and i was parking cars at a posh l a apartment house , waiting to be sent to basic training , then off to vietnam about three in the morning , i picked up a playboy magazine amazingly , it had fallen open to a short story called 'wanda hickey 's night of golden memories' by jean shepherd it was then , and remains today , the funniest story i have ever read it 's the reigning champ , with warm recollections of jean 's grimy midwestern steel town , his cronies and the biggest night in most of our adolescent lives the senior prom if you 've seen or read 'a christmas story' , you 'll enjoy the gradual , precise setup and hilarious payoff of 'wanda ' i should mention that i write \( and read \) for a living in the automotive magazine business
very good in the sequel line , but i figured out who dun it before i finished the characters are still developing well , waiting for the next one i have the whole series
boulder , colorado author , margaret coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal it 's always two looks ahead , of everybody else , she says using the wolf as metaphor , she gets the villain in her mystery novel the eye of the wolf at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters
margaret coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the wind river reservation in wyoming and describes the arapahoe customs in wonderful detail in this installment , father o'malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the arapahoe and shoshone indians has been re ignited , and that dead indians can be found on an ancient battle ground when father o'malley goes to investigate , he discovers three dead shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles things heat up when the young shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends vicky holden , the other main character in the series , has entered into a law partnership with adam lone eagle , and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling vicky wants to defend frankie montana , who is a suspect in the murders , and adam tries to persuade her not to take frankie as a client as always , author coel creates a wonderful setting and characters , and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series
it is hard to believe that margaret coel began her wind river reservation series some ten years ago with the eagle catcher , which introduced readers to father john o'malley and defense attorney vicky holden each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between o'malley and holden the latest installment in this series is no exception
the poetic macabre message shakes up father john o'malley , the jesuit pastor at st francis on the wind river plantation the caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths not long afterward , at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the shoshone betrayed the arapaho to the cavalry , three shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here
eye of the wolf by margaret coel isbn 0425205460 due out today \( 6 september 2005 \) i was sent an arc of this great book to read for review which i do gladly i had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them , especially spirit woman and story teller , so was expecting good things i was not disappointed the series follows the adventures of father john o'malley , pastor of st francis mission on the wind river reservation and tribal attorney , vicki holden and apart from a ripping good mystery , the author weaves the history of the arapho and the soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well , bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life it is not hard to care about the indian priest as they call father john or vicky holden i think what i enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well they were brought vividly alive by the author 's words from the first mystery message this is for the indian priest , everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield but does it \? \? this is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish
carole radziwill 's memoir is an exquisite description of loving relationships , family expectations , and maintaining a marriage with constant threat of terminal illness the book is written in a no nonsense tone as the tragic story of her husband 's recurrent cancer unfolds , carole never resorts to hyperbole interconnected themes are deftly strung together like pearls anthony radziwill did not want others to know of his illness , and the weight of maintaining a pretense that all was well increased with each bad check up his deteriorating prognosis and certain death was never openly discussed , although his cousin , john kennedy , tried to push carole into doing so
i have read quite a few memoirs lately \( the tender bar , the year of magical thinking , million little pieces part memoir \) and by far this was the best one i read i love carole radziwell 's writing style and i found her story to be gutsy , emotional and truthful as a person who watched a loved one die of cancer before my eyes i could totally relate to her feelings of frustration , helplessness and sadness i can say their is nothing on earth worse than watching a love on deteriorate before your eyes and not able to save them i had no idea of the relationship between her and the kennedy family so i was very intrigued by her personal view of the family and the friendship i felt she wrote this book with great respect for her husbands family revealing what she deemed approriate written with integrity this was a magnificent first book and i look forward to reading more of her work i highly recommend this book
just as i said in the title this is an amazing look at love and death and being in the spotlight when you enter that inner circle of the famous or society not the infamous , not the instant celebs but the inner circle of names that make america what it is carole radziwill married john john 's cousin , son of lee radziwell \( jackie o 's sister \) and because of this she entered the inner kennedy circle and coincidentally became one of carolyn \( john 's wife \) best friends some fascinating stuff here i think many of us assumed that carolyn and carole were both upper class they appear to have been middle class and even worked at the same department store in nyc at one time where they had to wear yellow aprons of course carolyn worked in cosmetics dept and carole worked in customer service the fascinating part of this book is that carole is able to somehow view both the yin and yang of her marriage and the relationship with the kennedy family especially john and carolyn carole 's husband gets cancer and is actually dying the week that john and carolyn 's plane crashes carole is the one who has to notify the coasts guard and carolyn 's family it 's a great book to read to show that you can be happy and sad at the same time i appreciate her honesty she signed up for love and roses and got death and dying much of the time now it 's time for her to get her own life again a former news researcher she spent much of her married life taking care of a sick and or dying husband and then dealing with the kennedy tragedy too fascinating book
those of us who have a story to share should do so , and this story is beautifully written what remains is a unique one , worth telling , and would be even if it did not involve america 's single most famous family the details carole radziwill reveals are intimate , yet never give away more than those connected and still living would find intrusive at times her pain is almost palpable , and she seems still slightly bewildered about her life and the tragic turn it took during the summer of 1999 the very fact that she did live it and came through it gives her every right to tell about it , and i am glad she chose to do so
this is not the memoir of carole radziwill it is a memoir for each person who reads the moving story
in one of what appears to be carole radizwill 's not so subtle jabs at her mother in law \( and at many of the extended family \) , she implies lee wondered what exactly her son saw in carole something along the lines of how much do they have in common beides abc \? after finishing this book , i have to say i have no idea what , if anything , they did have in common , nor , more importantly , what it was that first caused them to fall in love while i can understand and appreciate the author 's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship , i think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place as has been commented on by many reveiwers , she sounds much more passionate when she writes of carolyn bessette kennedy \( again , not in a lesbian way , but in an idealized school girl crush way \) i found myself wondering if they really were as close as carole portrays , or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to carolyn forever
i just finished the book last night , crying as i read the last few pages i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press she was a delightful and woman , filled with life , which makes her ending even more tragic the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde
if anyone in this most famous dynasty has earned this title , she would be the one congrat 's to anthony , john and carolyn for recognizing true class , as it is a rarity it speaks volumes about them ! ! carole 's courage and capacity to love will amaze her talent is another thing entirely off the charts ! ! ! \( put aside some quiet time and a lot of kleenex ! \)
i really enjoyed this book this is a memoir , not a novel , which explains why reading it felt like reading a journal i loved carole 's style of writing and the way she portrayed things i think she wanted this to be just a story of friends , and not focus on who the friends were i think she accomplished this it did not feel like just another book about the kennedy family even though i knew how the book would end , i cried it was written so beautifully
this book was a disappointment a real textbook would actually have instruction this book is merely a collection of cases , with a few scattered chapters on vc pe only buy the book if required to for a class
this book provides a good overview of venture capital and buyout fund management it addresses the investment process through four modules fundraising , investing , exiting , and new frontiers there are twenty nine chapters of which nine are instructional and the rest are case studies though there is information interspersed within the case studies , i think it would have been better to have had shorter case studies and longer instructional pieces to delve more deeply into subjects
a must for anyone wanting to know how vc firms work , structure themselves , and considerations for funding this is an excellent case study that ought to be in a graduate program ! it 's as close as you 'll get without working for a vc firm i would suggest reading the venture capital cycle first to get a general feel for vc and how it works then read the case study
want examples of how funding works \? want to know how venture firms set up their business \? want to know everything about practical application of vc firms \? this may be as close as you 'll get without actually working in one this ought to be a text book in graduate school i 'd suggest the venture capital cycle as the first book to get an overview of vc 's then , read this one and you 'll be pretty proficient in terms of being an outsider great case study
the author insists , so far as i can tell , that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some aristotelean idea of the 'premise' which cannot be violated 'love leads to death' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love this is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot it 's absurdly reductionist
let 's be clear what we 're buying here an authoritative text on how to deploy character , crescendo , climax and theme in the idiom of the dramatic novel frey is covering the big picture , how skilled writers nurture the evolution of tensions through the work as a whole his references to the classic canon of american fiction reinforce the message that these techniques are the essence of drama , and not just the stock in trade of pulp fiction
how to write a damn good novel is billed as a step by step no nonsense guide to dramatic storytelling i do n't know about the step by step part , but frey 's advice is definately no nonsense and will help you create dynamic stories
this book has broken down all the elements that make a book a page turner and a financial success !
if your learning style is to learn a formula , then expand from there , then this is the perfect approach for you let me be clear if you are a beginner , learning the craft , then this is a good place to start , one of the two best books on novel writing in my opinion but this book will work for you only if you are best served by learning a basic formula first , then building upon it and venturing into the unknown or breaking the rules here 's another way to look at it some people can learn to drive a stick shift and traffic rules at the same time others do better with an automatic transmission , allowing them to concentrate on learning traffic rules in a vehicle that shifts by itself \( a formula \) , then later learning to use a manual transmission if you are in this latter category , someone who learns better by first mastering the well beaten path , then this is the best book to get you started
this is one of the best books i 've read on writing and i 've read lots i was amazed every chapter was important and significant
how to write a damn good novel is a very good book on the subject it is all inclusive , well written , and to the point the outline permits the reader to understand how to proceed and , because of a few very fine examples , to feel that it is possible something i learned from this book that is not necessarily in others is the idea of developing a compelling premise before engaging in the long process of writing a novel the book is brief and could rank above the many books trying to help the writer with too many words
this book is full of the best advice i have ever read for new writers which is what i am , or hope to be
although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how to write book , my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise \( such as cheaters never win \) before you begin to write this kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers , leading to work that can be preachy , predictable , and cliched many times , the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process , but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer
i'm a junior in college , and my parents bought this cookbook for me as a gift for my first apartment my experience with cooking has n't really gone past heating up chicken cutlets in the oven , so i was a little wary of using an actual cookbook but this book is really useful
with the hotplate and microwave on the cover , you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items this is not the case yes , there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter , but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven and even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space , extensive preparation , and a large number and variety of ingredients
ben ari has written a highly enjoyable book about the nature of science that reads quickly and easily i strongly recommend this book for anyone involved with teaching science \( that may be a professor , secondary , or elementary school teacher \) the author takes the best , most sober points from philosophers , historians , and sociologists of science and demonstrates the implications these works have for preparing a scientifically literate public he clarifies troublesome definitions such as theory fact proof and hypothesis his insights on falsification and the need for an understanding of statistics are dead on i am using this book in the post secondary courses i teach
in this discerning and somewhat humorous essay , virginia woolf remarks on humanity 's experiences with illness , whether mental or physical , and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art she notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world hermione lee 's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of woolf 's life and writing this paris press edition recreates the original artwork and typeset of the 1930 printing of on being ill
get ordained in something ! \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! interview the town hermit for the local newspaper ! \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! need i say more
i'm married and bought this book for some ideas on what to do while my husband is out of town on business trips or playing weekend warrior i disagree with the last review i think the whole idea for the book \( we 'll give you the ideas , you plan it out \) is right on after all , is n't it supposed to be about getting out of the house and into life \? nor do i agree with the sentiment that going to town hall meetings are not fun at all maybe getting involved with city politics is n't your idea of a good time , but what 's one woman 's junk is another woman 's treasure overall , a very good read with even better ideas
i love this book and have bought some for gifts for friends and family too ! the authors have created and collected lots of highly innovative ideas and presented them in such a humorous way i have literally laughed out loud upon reading most of the chapters when is their next book coming out \? i ca n't wait
truly a classic and juggernaut effort of bringing together various disparate scientific socio anthropological thoughts into a coherent and fluent theory and more amazingly in a form that is both accessible and entertaining for the layman reader
this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 , 000 years across the continents diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali yali 's question was , why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea , but we black people had little cargo of our own \?
one the best books on the subject a must read , but you need to know your history and geography first , if not , have a map ready be prepared for a fast and furious ride through time and geography , but with constant flashbacks to the present you will not look at the world the same way after finishing this book , provided that you have the intellectual capacity and curiousity to read it cover to cover
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs \( more than the other 2 \) , and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , collapse a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now rk
this is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the human development ,
this book is a must read for all social science academics and the like j diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others although he is believable , his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic
diamond presents a look at the evolution of various cultures throughout the world and how geography has played an important part in their developement the reason that eurasia and north africa evolved more highly developed \( technologically anyway \) cultures was that there was a wider variety of wild plant and animal species that could be tamed by the humans living in those areas following the ice age than there was available to humans in other parts of the world this enabled people in these areas to develope farming societies \( which required more specializations than hunter gatherer societies \) more quickly than in other parts of the globe
i recommend this book to anyone who has come from a dispensational background and is interested in eschatology \( end times \) it is very well written with short chapters that do n't bog the reader down with difficult theological jargon exposes the reader to a historicist \( typically seventh day adventist \) interpretation of end times scriptures that will challenge you to dig deeper into the word of god with a critical eye
this is a must read no matter what you believe !
a case for amillennialism understanding the end times
this is the second book by steve wohlberg that i have read this book is more comprehensive than truth left behind mr wohlberg 's books are easy reads i 'll state up front that i do n't agree with everything that he wrote the identity of israel in this book is basically replacement theology , or the idea of a spiritual israel when considering that revelation identifies 12 tribes in rev 7 4 8 \( see also 21 12 13 \) i ca n't see israel being a spiritual entity enough of the negative the historicist view is very sensible when considering the source of the preterist and futuristic views of revelation i did n't know the history or source of these two theories before reading steve wohlberg 's books he exposes the flaws in both theories well why would the church be spared tribulation when countless believers of the past were murdered for their beliefs \? check out foxe 's book of martyrs steve wohlberg does an excellent job in answering that question and more with the bible take the bible and a knowledge of history and you can learn a lot about the book of revelation ! while i do disagree on one point , i recommend this book as an answer to the fiction of the left behind series
what a great book i have been studying the bible on these subjects for sometime and was convinced that the the holy scriptures did not teach the commonly held evangelical view of the rapture , israel , and the antichrist praise god that a voice has been raised to expose these fables and deceptions if you are a sincere bible student i would encourage you to get this book could it have been put together better \? probably , but let not that take away from the truths that are revealed here christians it is high time that we get back to the burean method of bible study \( acts 17 \) and not be taken by certain authors just because the local christian bookstore promotes them if we are deceived , we have no one to blame but ourselves because truth is out there the question is are we willing to dig for it \?
interesting eye opener i would have preferred a longer presentation of evidence to sustain it 's conclusions
this is a good introduction for those who are interested in a comprehensive , but not in depth , review of the historicist view wohlberg covers a lot of ground in 200 pages , so he does not look at alternative interpretations of passages or examine potential textual difficulties he simply presents the interpretation as he sees it this is appropriate to the book 's intended audience , however , which appears to be a popular audience , not a scholarly one
i havent read the book , but i have something to say in response to gregory nyman he said ,
when i first started reading this book , i literally devoured it from page to page , believing it to be groundbreaking and a tour de force after i read it , i reflected on its message , and found i was n't as excited as i first thought then i thought about writing a review , but had to caution against emotionalism , and this kind of book certainly stirs up the pot of emotionalism
anthropologist on mars begins with a quote by geneticist j b s haldane a quote that so beautifullly sums up the book 's aim as to bear repeating
i recommend dennis littrell 's review of this book on this site he outlines clearly what the book is about , and gives us the basic story of each of the seven chapters , the seven cases that make up the book he headlines his review 'extraordinary genius' and i share this feeling about oliver sachs
an anthropologist on mars is the much anticipated follow up to his previous best seller , the man who mistook his wife for a hat in it , dr sacks further explores the recesses of the central nervous system 's never ending quest for logic and understanding gestalt tells us that if we look at a broken circle long enough , the brain will fill in the missing piece the brain easily embraces a circle , but finds no concrete logic to a broken circle thus , the brain rejects such a concept as impossible consider our memories most people have heard that eye witness accounts of rare events are digitized in such a way that the brain can change the sequence of events in a manner scewed toward the logical arrangment of the rare event people who have witnessed an aircraft explode during flight most often remember this rare event quite differently immeadiatley after it happens plains do n't explode then crash , plains crash , then they explode that makes sense to the brain , but explode then crash does not make sense ok , enough of psych 101 as a neurologist , dr sacks understands how the brain works , and is thus able to explain it in an easy going manner it was n't until a skiing accident though inwhich dr sacks lost a leg , and learned first hand the phenomonon of phanthom feeling that he became fully aware of the brains search for logic the brain hates the idea of one leg , and thus continues to accept information from something that is n't even there , and , more remarkably , responds to the information now armed with subjectivity as well as objectivity , dr sacks marshalls his considerable talent as a writer and walks a thin line in the telling of our miraculous brain finally , it 's clear he really cares about the people he puts forth as examples of neurological insult he offers us a wide variety of people , thier afflictions , and the results he does seem to favor tourette syndrome as a perfect example of a brain run amuk after all , tourette syndrome is named after a student of great french neurologist jean charcot dr tourette devoted his career to the study of one person who suffered from what we now call tourette syndrome dr sacks widens the view effectively
this is one of those non fiction books which keeps you turning the pages sacks is a neurologist who aside from having insights into the field also obviously truley cares about his subjects he uses this care to get to a depth of explanation of case histories in a manner i have not encountered before highly recommended
these are true tales from a clinical neurologist 's notebook , but this is n't just any neurologist oliver sacks , author of the justly celebrated , the man who mistook his wife for a hat \( 1986 \) and awakenings \( 1973 \) , which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams , and other works , is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating , yet studiously objective , a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations , historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales , and of all of sacks 's work , is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you 've never read sacks before , you are in for a very special treat
this is the first oliver sacks book i 've read and i found it fascinating and informative once i started a case history i was hard put to stop reading until i found out the end result i particularly enjoyed the stories about the amnesiac greg and the colorblind artist sacks puts a human face on insights about how our brains work in an intellectually stimulating yet emotionally touching way i found the story about virgil , the blind man who gets his sight back and must learn how to see in his 50s particularly heart wrenching the only story i bailed out on was about an autistic woman who works in a cattle slaughterhouse \( i could not handle the graphic nature of the story \) i definitely recommend this book if you appreciate shows like nova or if you watch discovery television anyone who wants to know more about the mysteries of our human brains will be enriched by this book
i know very little about psychology , but i found this book to be both informative and touching i first heard about it when a cook at my summer camp read us the last hippie during an evening program i was fascinated by the story finally , when i picked up a copy of the book for myself , i read through the whole thing in a day i actually cried during one of the stories oliver sacks teaches you a lot about how the human brain works without getting too clinical , and lets the humanity of the people he profiles shine through this is a really good book
oliver sacks' an anthropologist on mars is a delightful and enlightening book that reveals the unparalleled complexity of the human brain
expertly written , the stories are fascinating , endearing , enlightening you 'll learn so much about how your own mind is wired by reading the stories of these very special people the medical and literary communities need more people like oliver sacks
if you 're interested in campaigns and politics , this is a great book to pick up ! although it may seem thick , the pages somehow manage to fly by james baker is the epitome of a political guru ! if you did n't know that before reading the book , you certainly will know it afterward
you read a book like this to get a feel for what 's it would be like to be considered the gold standard in electoral politics nobody in modern times has had the success or the good fortune to be on the winning side of so many presidential elections one of baker 's competitors is james carville , the man who more than any other , helped bill clinton to defeat george hw bush and his manager james a baker iii in 1992 it was carville who referred to baker as the gold standard
i did not know a great deal about james baker before i read this book , but i mean it as a compliment to the clarity of his reminiscences when i say i think i do now in the field of political autobiography , it is not always the case that one emerges knowing more about the author and subject than when one began from the pages of his book i discern that james baker is not without wit , albeit at times a distinctly biting one he is also less a statesman than a politician , and less a politician than a man with protective loyalty to his friends he is perhaps above all someone with a talent for inserting himself into a situation and calling on a lifetime 's worth of well placed contacts when there is a need to get things done in short , to his party and to its inner circle , mr baker is invaluable
in reflecting upon the life of james baker through his second memoir 'work hard , study and keep out of politics ! ' the one thing that continued to stay in my mind is baker 's openess that one of the reasons why he stayed in politics was 'power' what a refreshing statement the truth ! this is not so minimal a statement when reading the many self serving political memoirs published , particularly from the reagan era politicians who have published throughtout the years the life of jame baker is quite remarkable , and the sharing of his life and decisions as shared in this memoir are encompassing of service to this nation well done i may not necessarily agree with all the decisions made by baker during the years he served 3 different presidents , but i do respect the man and the integrity of this book there rings certain truths throughout , and his openess about 'power' provide a sense of credability to his perspectives
i ca n't recommend this book highly enough i read the original book , and loved it , but knew there was more that i was missing the workbook asks detailed and sometimes confronting questions , and acts as an aide to hearing god i found once i started asking god these questions , i had the insight i needed to break through so many of the walls i 'd put to god , myself , and others as a result , my relationships are healthier , and i am a less defensive person
i found myself reaching to answer these questions , in the spirit of being cooperative almost making mountains out of molehills as i viewed my life
i never take the time to write reviews so take this as a sixth star for the sacred romance along with it 's study guide companion i first read the book a year ago and had a so so reaction to it it was good , and it helped me take a unique look at god 's most dramatic act of love on our behalf still , i pretty much forgot about it not long after i read it i ca n't tell you how different my reaction to this book was about a year later when my small group decided to use t s r for our lesson wow ! we now have a level of trust with each other and with that trust have been able to share old wounds of the heart that were prohibiting us from the most important relationship of our lives \( a relationship with god of course \) and we were also able to build each other up if you are in a small group i urge you to consider the sacred romance if everyone in your group is honest and takes the chance to be a little vulnerable with each other it will change the dynamics of how you study together dramatically
read this if you desire to take you faith to the edge with on the living god as your guid
the author is definately very qualified to write this book he generally keeps the reader engrossed as he creates the backdrop and context for each of the fairs unfortunately , he doesnt go very in depth into any particular fair , and the reader is left craving more photos the author frequently boasts about his extensive collection of memorabilia , but too little is shown its enjoyable for a quick read , but if you are interested in more in depth knowledge and imagery , you should investigate one of the more comprehensive books
i loved this book ever since my high school english teacher chastised me for trying to put miller 's the crucible in the context of the mccarthy era , i have been fascinated with the social context surrounding the creation of art jones focuses on the political as well as social context that has given birth to the great and the mediocre of the american musical first , his use of terms such as diversionary ring so true for those of us who love mindless fluff when we go to the theatre second , i was shocked at how little i had appreciated the contributions of african americans , inter alia , to the american stage prior to reading this book but , mostly , i liked how he articulated how a writer 's gestalt accounts for the end product on the stage and his description of how copy cat musicals come into being the book gave me the backstory to many of the original shows i had the good fortune to see on broadway i , for one , would love a volume ii of this book to be jones' next foray i especially offer this to aspiring young actors , writers , directors and songwriters as a required read before embarking on a life in musical theater if you want to create art , you must know from whence you came
as a lover of musical theater , and \( minor \) toiler in the vineyards , myself , i have probably read hundreds of books on the subject therefore , it is always a special treat to find one that brings a fresh slant to the subject jones' book does just that by treating musical theater styles neither as a simple reflection of , nor an escape from the world at large , but rather as an integral part of the whole , he presents a broad , but always entertaining and on target view of both the 20th century and musical theater 's part within same there are , as there always are in works of this scope , some factual errors \( e g no strings was n't richard rodgers' only public credit as a lyricist he 's also so credited on the score for the tv musical androcles amp the lion it ai n't broadway in every sense but it is public ! \) but none that take anythng away from the over all achievement of the work
the begining of the book is a little tough , being a white male but this a book that everyone should read ! the world would be a better place if they did
this book and the others by anne wilson schaef have helped me to put my own experience with family and society into a healthy perspective i say , bravo to this lady and her work ! excellent ! this work put me on the path to true emotional healing and understanding of why people act in harmful ways i say , no less than brillant thanks anne ! ! you rock
i read this book years ago or , rather , tried to i'm sure there are better examples of the truism , when all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail , but not many
this brilliantly innovative thinker throws back the curtains on our collective society 's understanding of ourselves , and opens up possibilities for really positive solutions to what ails our society as a whole , and its individuals , in particular ! ms schaef addresses all forms of addiction , from chemical to behavioral , and sees within our society 's gradual acceptance of its own corruptions the seven deadly sins of anger , covetousness , envy , gluttony , lust , pride and sloth perpetuating our malaise we see in our leaders the aspects of control , dishonesty and dualism \( seeing only two alternative solutions to any problem \) it is shocking to face these at first , but once the truth of it dawns on the reader , he she is led through the greatest assisting factors toward our collective recovery process \( the ideas used in the 12 step programs \) sobriety \( fastest route to clear thinking \) and spirituality \( not necessarily the dogmatic sort that keeps us in the submissive , non living , non aware state ! \) this book is not for the person too busy to have time to digest something wonderfully deep and enriching ! reading it is like taking a shower in the purest , cleansing water , and emerging to absorb its message like rays of powerful sunshine ! it is empowering a fantastic door opening to the possibilities of our becoming a truly free and healthy society of thinking , alive , deprogrammed individuals ! read this one before any of her other books ! her newly coined terms will become valuable assets in your vocabulary and liberated mind set
this is a top book it analyses the addiction patterns of individuals from the perspective of the addictive patterns in society as a whole ann wilson schaef goes beyond analysis of the problem of addiction to a very encouraging vision of another way of being alive , one that is mostly forgotten in our numb modern society if you are looking for some ways out of the cycle of addiction , this may be an important roadmap for you
this book is full of assumptions and generalizations some information is distorted according to the logic of the writer over 90 of the population should be already dead from addiction the writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful it is possible , but the writer does n't make any notes about the men and women centered systems the only system that is good is the female system
due to the pressures of modern life , many people are addicts of one kind or another anne schaef shows how society as a whole behaves in addictive ways we usually think of an addict as being someone addicted to a drug , but there are many kinds of addiction there are substance addictions , such as to alcohol , drugs , nicotine , caffeine and food everyday activities can become process addictions , such as accumulating money , gambling , sex , work , religion and worry personal relationships can also be addictive many politicians behave like addicts , as they are hooked on control , promising things will get better \( but they do not \) denying problems and denying alternative ways of doing things this all adds up to the addictive system which is modern society schaef concludes that we cannot allow anything to come between us and our spirituality , or between us and our living process if we do , we shall destroy ourselves and those around us this is a very worthwhile book , with penetrating insight into modern life
jim hightower pulls no punches in this revealing expose of how dirty our two party system is he provides example after example of how corporations have seized complete control of the government , taking power away from the citizenry sure , the rich have always enjoyed certain privelges that the rest of us do n't but in the last twenty years , there has been a growing , unbridled greed that is destroying the lives of millions for the benefit of a handful of modern day robber barons the vast majority of democrats and republicans have been bought and paid for by these insulated tycoons ever wonder about rich guys and corporations who give the maximum contribution to the democrat and the republican in the same race \? you can bet that it ai n't civic pride if you are tired of working two jobs , and never getting ahead , this book will explain the truth about what is happening
if you 're tired of the non news you are fed every night on the evening news show , get this book did you know that the average worker now makes less than in 1973 in inflation adjusted wages \? did you know that nafta has hurt american farmers and american workers , not helped them \? jim hightower gives you real news in his book why waste money on your local paper when it consists of nothing but corporate press releases \? this book shows how publicly financed elections cost less than the favors and giveaways your politicians provide to big campaign contributors this book is fun to read , too , in spite of the serious content , and would be a great gift for family and friends , both left and right wingers
when i first picked up this book i was immediately reminded of the 'amok 4th dispatch' catalogue back in 1989 the amok bookstore out of l a released a sourcebook for the extremes of information in print the book was an unbelievable find , a real jewel in the pre internet age virtually every author who appeared in the 'pulps' section of that catalogue has found themselves listed in this new rough guide
first , a word about the term cult fiction , and its implications when i first saw the title of this little book , i assumed it would be full of strung out wreckages like burroughs and dick while the rough guide does contain them \( as it should \) , its scope is far greater than writers of that type in here you 'll find a wind range of novelists reviewed , including graham greene , john fowles , even zane grey bottom line an excellent resource for readers
i picked this up on a recent vacation to minnapolis and found i could n't put it down i do think the book does omit some key cult writers but the ones who are included are handled by writers who obviously know their subjects this guide includes a lot of my favorite writers \( jonathan coe , italo calvino , jasper fforde , borges , etc \) and i was pleased to find out some things about their lives and work that i did n't know before the guide points out the writers' essential works and suggests what a particular writer might have in common with another writer the book is often funny without being mean spirited
let 's face it most books about writing are b o r i n g they usually range from dry to dry i 've often thought of this as a case of physician , heal thyself ryan 's ridiculously long title made me wonder if his book would land squarely in the middle of that dry pile i was pleasantly surprised to be wrong ryan has a straightforward and practical approach to writing in fact , he goes as far as to talk about writer 's intuition , and dares to promote a straightforward writing approach , plan then write this book talks about general corporate writing , but the information can be applied to other types of writing where we need to remember that every word we write , whether in team communication or in our work product , is an opportunity this book is great for less experienced writers trying to find structure in a formless void and it is perhaps equally valuable for experienced writers who are trying to call themselves back to the basics
this book tells the two real secrets that create good business writing , rule of thumb and writer 's intuition it also shares a very special secret in all good writing , how to avoid the rule burdened mechanics based approach that ruins most writers before they begin
another book about writing well \? who needs it , you ask \? my answer is anyone who wants to write better those who want to be better writers must continually practice their skills sure , you could probably improve your style without this book , but why not learn a few more tricks of the trade \? i especially enjoyed the rewrite examples \( rewriting history was particularly interesting \) expend a bit of energy reading and studying ryan 's book and then expect to write with a bit more ease someone once commented that even good writers need perpetual reassurance write up the corporate ladder is that reassurance
at last a clear and practical book that gets right down to the real issues excellent writing skills are critical to success in today 's world ryan gives proven and valuable steps to bring your writing to a new level of clarity and conciseness a real must have book
with time becoming more valuable each day , and email evolving as the convenient mode of communication , people tend to rush through common and simple memos and correspondence which can lead to bad writing habits and the potential for costly mistakes now that we have the technology to simplify communication , it 's time to upgrade our own communication skills to avoid the pitfalls and re focus upon what we 're trying to say kevin ryan not only gives us the tools to improve our writing but he introduces us to successful people who already have i write back cover promotional pieces for a book publisher and i 've cut hours from the amount of time it takes to create new , fresh and clear copy here 's a book that 's right for the times
13 stories , 13 epitaphs is the second book by william vollmann that i 've read and i still am not quite sure what to make of him the first was butterfly stories , a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in thailand chasing hookers , looking for the one with a heart of gold 13 stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless , jobless , and addicted drugs , as well as several whores it 's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about , which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society it makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable , i ca n't relate with the characters and do n't find much redeeming about his stories , it does n't seems like he has an overall plan , it 's not necessarily a morality tale i think i 've had enough of his novels
quick read that 's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children , and how that impacts the adult lives of those children
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good maybe better at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes \? of course not ! why , then , would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books , or a patterson and a connelly , or two thomas harris books my apologies , greg iles , but for a simple , formulaic serial killer book , blood memory was just way too long the book has two co plots one involves a serial killer who murders older men , the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting , but at least two thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles or his editor had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 3o , 40 or even 50 pages , but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera speak , meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths , these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream , taking showers , and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on , greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange , exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before \? just as some people love to hear themselves talk , i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good , blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
if you 're interested in forensics , chances are you 'll like this book the book also manages to tie in sexual abuse , repressed memories , miss , vietnam , ptsd , and a little romance it even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long i was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book 's plot and discussions as intricate as they are
based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes iles is a better writer than grisham , i picked up this book i do n't know if iles can outwrite grisham , but he is definitely a contender i found blood memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists but , it is on the grim side the main character pursues solving two mysteries , one a serial killer on the loose , and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie in the end the two mysteries are related , though i think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first 100 pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it
i guess it 's high praise for mr iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child free diving , drinking , valium , baths in scalding water
one of the boldest of the bold kudos to mr iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists nambla has been put on notice this is work of pure satisfaction , from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero , cat another worthy pile of words from mr iles , despite his ignorance regarding black people the dialog is downright embarrassing , but keep trying mr iles if you hang out with african americans rather than watch them on tv , perhaps you 'll get 5 stars next time
this is the first book i 've read by greg iles however , it will not be the last ! this book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues
as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse i found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person this book will stick with me a long time and i hope even though it is long , readers will give it the chance it deserves i thought this work by mr iles to be very insightful
read this book at a light warehouse because you will not want to be anywhere near the dark !
it is one of my favorite stephen king novels i 've ever read possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books it is extremely long and i must admit that i had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it i know it 's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long
when i first read this book , upon finishing it i immediately proceeded to rip it 's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces that was how much the story affected me it disgusted me , it disturbed me , it moved me after brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head , and if that 's not the mark of a great writer i do n't know what is i then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again
although i'm only 14 year old boy who lives in utah , i 've been a die hard stephen king fan since i was twelve , and i have to say , this is really the high light of his career
wow , what an epic
a book that enables you to travel back in time back to 1958 , back to a time when there was stan , mike , richie , bev , eddie , ben and big bill and some others back when some kids' main concern was avoiding henry bowers !
i wish this book had been available when i was 30 years younger as it might have helped me avoid some serious life errors i would have even been happy if this book was available when my daughter married 8 years ago however , even though the gems of wisdom came too late for us , i recommend that all brides and wives read this book if they want to learn to improve their life , being supportive of their husband yet never giving up their right to be treated well robin mcgraw strikes just the right balance of compassion and determination it is instructional without being preachy though best for christians the wisdom could apply to women of any or no formal religious faith it would be a good idea for young grooms to read this too \( to get an insiders view from the other side \) i bought the book because of the show on dr phil about the book \( okay i confess i wanted to read the dirt on dr phil \) but it was a delight in that you got the dirt but learned that the truth was given with a heaping helping of compassion i do n't know if i would enjoy hanging out with dr phil \( he is intense \) but i think i would love robin she admits to what she did wrong and tells women how they can find their voice to make the best life possible for themselves and their families if your life is n't perfect \( and i 've yet to find anyone whose life is \) then read the book , and if you agree pass it on to your sisters \( biological or otherwise \) here 's to mcgraw family values ! ! !
i loved robin mcgraw 's book ! her message regarding relationships , husbands , children and life in general is an important lesson for all of us life can throw all sorts of roadblocks before us , but if we trust in god and try to maintain a positive attitude , we will triumph over them i feel that robin wants all of us to experience the joys that are just waiting for us in life
i did n't like this book i thought it was a waste of time and money
this is a fabulous book filled with common sense \( which is not so common , after all ! \) robin shares her perspective on being a wife , mother , daughter , daughter in law and most of all a woman it 's not a self help book , but more of a this is how i did it , you can do it too book i really liked that she spoke about how women need to put themselves first \( self care \) on all levels to fill whatever roles we need and the personal devastation she went through in her own life because people around her did n't do this
i did not order this book and i did not authorize a charge to my credit car
i loved this book and could n't put it down , i read it in two days i wish i had a book like this to read when i was younger i recommed it to all young women and to older women too , we are never to old to learn i just ordered another copy for my youngest daughter as i did n't want to give my copy up thank you robin for sharing with us
to be honest with you i only received the books i ordered yesterday and i had no intensions to read the book by mrs edwards i bought the books for my two adult daughters as christmas presents however , i heard mrs edwards talking about her life and i assume the book on some tv program and was quite impressed with what she had to say my daughters are young adults and have not had to experience much loss or troubles in their lives i think mrs edwards relates to women that will help them through touch times in their lives and i would like my children to be able to handle those times as well as mrs edwards did and does she seems to be a strong and well adjusted person by the way , i would n't mind reading the book myself and i am the father of the daughters mentioned above
this is an amazing book that every woman should read and or listen to robin mcgraw is an incredable individual and dr phil should be very proud to have her for his wife ! the show now should be the robin and dr phil show for robin has as much to give to us as dr phil for woman with passion and purpose
excellent topic for woman of all ages this showes woman how
tina is molested by her stepfather , who she thinks is her real father , until her mother finally tells her that he is n't tina is vague about the details of the abuse and does n't actually say what happened , so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went she prays to god many times to make it stop \( why 'd he let it start in the first place \? \) , but god is not listening at those times finally after many years of this abuse , her mother catches them together , and instead of kicking him out , sends her daughter to a school out of town , with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day the lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together , and they do n't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he 's sorry \( sorry that he got caught \) says it 's just something about tina that makes him do it make sense \? the mother works at kmart and likes to have kids she does n't care about , and the dad works in an office
if you 've ever been suicidally depressed like tina , which i have , then this book may well change your whole life ! the power of tina 's story is in the simplicity of her words , and the courage of her traumatized soul i found myself crying from time to time while reading this book because it touched so many chords in my own broken heart the fact that god used a patrolman to save her life is just one part of this incredibly moving and unforgettable story i had never heard of tina zahn until i read this book , and now i ca n't stop telling people , especially those who are struggling with depression and trauma issues to read this book ! you wo n't regret reading it either , i assure you it will speak to your heart in a graphic but tender way
this is a great book for anyone who has ever battled depression or knows someone who has it really hit home for me and while i never went as far as to take my own life , i felt many of the feelings she describes after the birth of my second child it 's nice to know you are not alone thank you for sharing your story of hope and healing mops was also a saving grace for me in my struggles as well thanks mops ! !
women especially will connect with this book , whether they 've experienced postpartum depression or not as i read it , i realized how many women in my own life had experienced abuse , rejection , and depression that was so debilitating they considered taking their own life you 'll want to read this book for yourself and recommend it to others to share in tina 's struggles , her miraculous rescue , and her ultimate triumph through faith , medical help , and the support of her friends and her husband a great read that you wo n't forget
i have read literally thousands of books in my lifetime , but i have never read a book quite like this first , i am from wisconsin and have actually been to many of the places that tina mentions in her story second , i too have struggled for many years with serious depression i 've never actually attempted suicide , but i came very close to it one night 10 years ago it is only by the grace of god that i did n't attempt suicide that night i truly believe that god intervened in my life that night even though i did n't yet know christ as my savior i have struggled with serious depression off and on for the past 15 years there have been five or six periods in my life where i have felt seriously depressed for months at a time there is definitely a stigma in the church when it comes to depression a lot of people simply do n't know how to handle it i could relate to so many of tina 's struggles tina 's story is also my story i am so thankful that tina had the courage and strength to share such a deeply personal struggle with the world i believe that this book will give hope to those of us who struggle with depression but i believe it will also help those who have never had a problem with depression to be more compassionate and understanding struggling with serious depression can make you feel so alone and like there is no one who really understands but this book showed me that i am not alone in my struggles and that even if no one else does , god understands and cares i cried numerous times as i read this book this book has helped me believe that there is hope and help is available i do not have to suffer alone reading tina 's story also makes me want to begin counseling in order to deal with my depression and other issues openly and honestly
this is an amazing story thank god , tina zahn lived to tell it in this well written and easy to read account of a troubled life that eventually leads to an attempted suicide , we learn the true story behind the sensational headlines video footage of a young woman 's leap from wisconsin 's tallest bridge battling severe postpartum depression after the birth of her second child , coupled with unresolved traumas of sexual abuse by her stepfather that began at the tender age of five , we indeed learn why tina zahn jumped
i saw tina zahn on oprah , so i bought the book for my sister and i to read tina grew up in a rough family i think her step father should be shot and her sister and mother are insensitive tina zahn is a true survivor and an inspiration to mothers who may suffer from post partum depression
i cannot say enough good things about this book this series is some of the best writing james patterson has ever done ! not only am i totally hooked , but my daughter , grandaughter , and tons of her friends are as well this book has made the rounds through all of us and my grandaughter 's other middle school friends are begging to borrow it as well if you have n't read the maximum ride series yet , please grab maximum ride the angel experiment first then move straight on to this one all i can say is i ca n't wait for the next installment !
i purchsed this book , as well as maximum ride angel experiment i read them both before giving them to my children to read i found them to be clean of sex , language and violence we all throughly enjoyed them and would recommend them to any child who likes fantasy and drama
as an adult , i picked this book up for my daughter and began looking over it in the car before i knew it i had read the whole thing and wanted to read the first book in the series my daughter and i both really liked it , sci fi , adventure , and a little romance thrown in just for fun
i have really enjoyed both books about max that james patterson has written although he has created a unique family due to their scientific beginnings , they continue to face similuar issues that many young people and diverse families face i ca n't wait for mr patterson 's next version of life as only max knows it
after i read the first installment , i passed it along to my 13 year old daughter she has never been an avid reader , but she could not put that book down i ordered this one specifically so she would continue reading over the summer she enjoyed this one just as much after her friends got through reading the books , i finally got it back and found this to be a very entertaining book as well people can not believe that i would give a james patterson book to my 13 year old this is well suited for that age group i highly recommend it
best book in the series yet adults like it as much as the kid
to the brilliant mind of lincoln rhyme it becomes apparent early into the murder investigation that there are two killers involved , working in tandem and perhaps one in slave to the other a ticking clock is left at the first puzzling murder scene at the docks , and it at first appears as if someone has been suspended until their painful death finally relieves them of their agony it 's nasty , and its attention grabbing to a city that will always forever after be hyper aware of the danger in the every day a careful killer is calling himself the watchmaker , but for the investigating team that all seems a little obvious there are plenty of crime scenes , but where are the bodies \?
it 's been awhile since i had a really good crime mystery read therefore , i was excited when the cold moon by jeffery deaver arrived at the library the latest lincoln rhyme novel delivered just what i was looking for twists , turns , and plenty of forensic work
after 2 3 terrible lincoln rhyme books deaver gets his act together in the cold moon as a big lincoln fan , i am hoping this continues , as i was ready to stop buying rhyme books if you have n't already read bone collector , empty chair and coffin dancer , you 're missing out
although the plot twists in deaver books sometimes are a bit of a stretch they are certainly never dull
a new lincoln rhyme novel brings the thriller genre to high tension , especially spiced with joe mantegna 's readings he 's received emmy nominations for his tv work and won the tony award for his stage work there should be an award for his smooth voice which perfectly captures the tension brewing from the story of deadly murders in new york city and a renowned criminologist who comes to realize the killer 's future plans this is audio at its best
i was disappointed in the latest lincoln rhyme mystery the book had more twists than a chubby checker song and in the end they strained credibility
a number of reviewers have complained about this book saying that it really would n't happen this way , that the twists and turns of the plot which is a staple with mr deaver are too far fetched to believe
my first deaver i want more also my first book review the book was really fun to read but i agree with some of the other reviewers here who said the plot twists strained credulity still , i love the way deaver paints people so vividly , and scenes , and the conversations made me laugh he 's a master at this katherine dance for instance she was the cop from california who helped interview the suspects now my question is is there really such an interview technique as the one she uses throughout the book \? i did a few searches , nothing came up so far very interesting anyway , that 's my review i recommend the book basically , despite the mazelike plot i 've found a new favorite author
this unique book tells the story of a bunch of intrepid and inspired men who pioneered the exploration of the last great unknown the deeps of the sea how would you fancy wading out under water with nothing more than an inverted coal bucket over your head \? would you agree to a fight a shark , equipped with nothing more than a knife , all so that some movie company could film the gory encounter \? inventive , adventurous , foolhardy to the point of recklessness , many of the diving pioneers were also world famous in their own right , like the great biologist jbs haldane , who worked out how to survive at dangerous depths others evolved from treasure seekers to become the first underwater archaeologists , exploring ancient shipwrecks in exotic waters , or , most interesting of all , opening our eyes to the beauty of marine habits and wildlife , including the seriously threatened coral reefs the author , himself a marine biologist and diver , blends all this into a magical weave of fact and wonder enlivened by a mordant wit and a delightful eye for quirky detail i would recommend it to any reader
fast shipping and great shape the only problem we had was that the cd inside the book was for indesign instead of photoshop
this book is very easy to follow each chapter begins by telling you what it will cover and how long it will take to complete the book comes with a cd which contains lesson plans for each chapter the object is to have you work along as the chapter progresses giving you some hands on practice it is definitely a useful resource for the beginner photoshop student
quite honest book and matches with any beginner 's expectation cd works really fine illustrating each and every example should the reader classify himself as a photo shop regular user , scott kelby the photoshop cs2 book will be more aggressive
i purchased this book for my class , and i was not disappointed i knew very little about photoshop when i started my online class , and i felt that this book was very helpful and answered pretty much all my beginner photoshop user questions i would recommend this book for people who want to learn the basics about using photoshop
im a college student , ive taken multiple classes that were supposed to teach us software via textbooks and this is by far the easiest book to follow i have no formal experience with the software , i just bought it recently because this is the last year i will be able to take advantage of a student discount on software , and i thought it would come in handy ive burned thru the first 1 2 of the book in 3 nites , prolly 2 hours a nite its not tedious at all , very straight forward and color illustrated step by step they give you the keyboard shortcuts , as well as the pull down menu commands upfront , and it guides you through the things you will actually use without alot of b s i will be ordering the rest of the series on adobe software to learn the rest of the web bundle , probably the best 45 ive spent on textbooks yet
i 've tried learning photoshop many times before , but each book i read made me loose interest this book is fun , and arranged in a way so that lessons are neither too long nor too short
adobe 's instruction book are very basic , and boring get deke 's books you 'll be glad you did
this is the 12th or 13th book i have purchased about photoshop i wish it had been my first purchase , because i am finally now learning the ins and outs of adobe 's photoshop cs2 when i finish the lessons and projects in this book , i believe the other books on the same subject will be easy to understand
this is definitely a hands on book the clear color pictures and illustrations are rather concise and informing i am about in the middle of the book now and am already tweaking family photos
the classroom in a book series is great for describing functions and tools a user would otherwise not become familiar with however , the illustrator text is more accurate in describing how the software responds that is , some settings and functions do not work like or are not housed where described in the photoshop text still , the book is useful , and i'm happy with it 's use as a resource
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent , he had a crappy upbringing , that does not make for a good book
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books , especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items , which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug , self serving and self indulgent , written by a person with little or no empathy , especially for the people he castigates for example , his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the
this book was horrible if it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have i am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend i read half of it , suffering from a headache the entire time , and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire one less copy in the world do n't waste your money
if you like strange stories , you will love running with scissors because it is just plain weird after reading this book , you will have a feeling that you just returned from the twilight zone
how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book the book was anything but funny i read about half , up to
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius , and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
what happened to american girls , to women , over the past hundred years , that caused a quantum shift in how they present themselves to the world \?
the body project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of african american adolescent girls and their personal body projects the main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle class adolescent girl throughout american history african american and jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters , while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in brumberg 's book \?
this book was referenced in a text that i read regarding teen sexuality , and since the reference sounded interesting i found a copy of it brumberg discusses here what she calls the body projects of teenage and adult women and how these projects have changed over time by body projects she means what women are focused on changing about themselves at a particular place in history , whether it be the face , the body , or their sexuality in describing these particular projects the author goes into detail about the history of menarche and menstruation , acne , and the hymen while also discussing the history of the social aspects of virginity and how female sexuality was \( and is \) perceived and discussed within a family and society
joan jacobs brumberg 's the body project an intimate history of american girls is a fascinating read as an teacher and researcher on the field of young women and coming of age , i am quite pleased by the wealth of information , both scholarly and anecdotal , i learned from this book brumberg fleshes out an in depth analysis of girls' body projects from the 1800s to the present day and supplements her vast research with diary accounts from young women throughout history
in her book , brumberg recognizes the struggles that young women go through in order to feel accepted in society , and discusses a variety of body projects ranging from acne troubles to anorexia i think that most women today have felt the pressure that is driving them to make their bodies perfect , and therefore can relate their own lives directly to the situations that are presented i found it interesting to read about the lives of many victorian girls that had had problems so similar to my own and how they confronted those problems in very different ways i found this book to be very informative and although it contained captivating information , brumberg continually repeated her earlier thoughts in later chapters i thought that she could have added more depth to her commentary to make her work a stronger piece of literature
i learned a lot from this book about the history of how girls' bodies have overtime become more and more public it is such a compelling read ! this book has inspired me to do something to keep society from affecting my view of my own body , as well as for future women and girls
this book was an amazing journey that helped me understand the underpinnings of the modern american woman 's relationship with sexuality by tracing the roots of our modern traditions to their victorian foundations , brumberg educates the reader and also paints a stark picture of the way young girls have started to come into their sexuality in the past few decades she argues that girls today are out of sync , that their bodies develop before they are emotionally ready to deal with issues of sexuality she further asserts \( and proves , in my opinion \) that the historical move away from home based economies and social structures has robbed modern girls of vital mentoring from their adult female relatives this lack of female mentoring leads to the confusion and insecurity that anyone who watches mtv cannot deny is rampant today this book is an important read for educators , parents , and anyone interested in unerstanging how \( and why \) young women today experience sexualization by a culture all too ready to exploit their insecurities for profit all in all , a fascinating and very readable study of a crucial subject
brumberg 's work details the changes in cultural constructions of the adolescent body in the twentieth century , focusing on how young women create , maintain , and alter body images \( and ultimately , body shapes appearances \) i use this book as the first monograph assignment in my introduction to women 's studies course although the book has a strong theoretical framework , the descriptive examples in the chapters help to facilitate discussion in the class , which really sets the tone for the rest of the semester college women find the book engaging , and they are very personally affected by the stories that relate so well to them i find it an extremely informative , very useful book
dick staub does a fabulous job of tying in the old teachings of the bible with the very popular star wars saga ! this is an amazing book and it is very insightful if you are looking to change your life and be a better christian , this book is for you ! ! !
dick staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a jedi in the ways of the force in star wars and the walk of a christian following god in life today however , he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the star wars movies , and i even found a misquotation from the bible he makes good points , but these details were distracting to me as i read i am not yet finished and will leave more once i am done
the book seems to miss the mark it just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right \? ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side
i was very excited when i came across this book i am both a christian and a star wars nut i began reading this book right away , and it started slow i kept reading , hoping it would really dive into some good contrast it never came i'm sure this guy meant well , but he had a very shallow knowledge of the star wars films , and on the christian side , everything felt like it was from a 5th grade sunday school class i want so badly for this book to be great , but it is not i wish i would have written it
a good book that explores the star wars saga from a christian perspective without compromising either faithfulness to christian faith or to the star wars cosmology i was troubled a bit by the many errors in this book incorrect statements about biblical characters , star wars movies , as well as lord of the rings
from the christian stand point , it just reinforces everything you read about and hear about from principle christian literature
contrast this with god , the devil , and harry potter and note a pattern of interpretation that points in the same direction there is one true myth , it is encapsulated best in the christian myth but other narratives that employ that myth manage to lead us in the right direction as well they support it a myth is a story that confronts us with the big picture , something transcendent and eternal , and in so doing explains the worldview of a civilization \( p xviii \)
i was intrigued by the title , which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity well , after 60 pages or so , i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life but , i say that any religious life \( be it christian , islam or otherwise \) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional
staub has an interesting way of interlacing biblical tradition from both the old and new testaments with actions and pronouncements of the principal characters in fact , one might evn , after reading this book , conclude that the star wars series was nothing but a long running morality play which parallels the major morals and ethical values of much of the civilized world certain to provoke thoughtful reflection
this book is great it is definately not just for star wars fans , every christian , every one actually would do good to read this book it is my second favorite book , behind only the bible it has helped me tremendously
i have been a fan of peter carey forever and have read all his work his work , however , has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book weird characters and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style , some of his stuff almost crossed the line \( my life as a fake \) to the inintelligible but theft makes it all the way i found the characters somewhat boring , and the language , idioms , references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases perhaps if you are a sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense but for the rest of us i am really sorry to report the book is not readable i quit after reading about 2 3ds and for me that is unheard of i feel like i have lost at good friend
peter carey is an amazing writer , and theft is a charming novel about the art world the satirical insights are very apt and often laugh out loud hilarious , and carey has a wonderful way of displaying his characters' pretensions and foibles without belittling them somehow , when i read carey , i am reminded of iris murdoch and nathalie sarraute , as they also set their novels in heady milieus of the arts and academia , and were adept at skewering pretensions without losing affection
it 's no denying peter carey is a brilliant writer his flair for pin pointing the nuances of the good old aussie vernacular is spot on , and his characters are always society 's off cuts , but ultimately likeable souls theft a love story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read but unlike his brilliant true history of the kelly gang , it seems that carey was n't sure how to end this wonderful tale , and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning
michael boone , a thirty something painter who has gone out of fashion , is desperate to have his newest work noticed and to reestablish himself as a success michael is also the reluctant caregiver to his mildly autistic brother hugh , who has a disabled yet perceptive view of his frustrated brother in theft a love story , these boone brothers narrate a story of thwarted talent , desperate ambition , fraternal responsibility , and loutish dependence , which becomes a mystery of theft and love when they meet marlene leibovitz , a beautiful art authenticator who may know something about a valuable stolen painting the question that this fascinating novel poses is how far will michael boone , who is angry at the art establishment , go to achieve artistic and emotional success \? where does he draw the line \?
this is a smart , funny exploration of one of the lesser known elements of the high stakes art world the right of an artist 's estate to declare a work authentic or not the questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book 's narrative structure , in which the story is told through two competing voices one a defeated , cynical , world weary artist and the other his slow witted , demanding and cantakerous brother neither is a particularly reliable narrator , but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet
a swirling canvas of art scams , art history , and australian attitude is just backdrop this book is really about two brothers , slow bones and butcher bones aka hugh and michael boone one is mentally impaired \( he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by \) the other is an artist each , by his nature , must be different from the rest of the world slow bones ca n't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares and butcher , though more adept , is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify his art
after reading a less than fully positive review by updike in the new yorker , i thought is was time for a first encounter with carey 's work i am afraid i have to disagree with the old boy theft is a masterpiece
first rate story i highly recommend this book
when i the reviews to this book i thought to myself this is going to be the read of the summer so naturally , i went to my local bookstore and paid 24 00 a few hours later , i went back and returned it it was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere i do n't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless , with no execuse for its swearing literature is n't trash , mr carey
daniel c dennett is a very confrontational philosopher , much like peter singer and like singer , he is a strong atheist dennett will brook nowhere for what he regards is muddled thinking about anything which hides the true nature of things , and for dennett , natural science and the idea of evolution are the true nature of things
darwin 's dangerous idea by daniel c dennett is a fantastic book but definitely not for the faint of heart the book is almost 600 pages long and written in a style that requires college level analysis to understand my review can hardly do it justice but hopefully it might encourage you to buy it or at least to check it out of the library for a couple of weeks of interesting reading
dennett 's metaphor for darwinism is that acts like a universal acid upon everything it touches and that means literally everything it eats into the foundations of the hard sciences , the various and rather less solid underpinnings of the social sciences , the sometimes ridiculous and sometimes incisive branches of psychology , and the claims made as to any potential \( though often simply vaporous and intentionally obscure \) philosophical or theological `truths' in the round there is nothing that it does not take a substantial bite from , and that fact cannot be avoided unless you merely opt for silly , ignorant avoidance , i e , you either refute or run for cover ! bravo dennett , then , as somebody needed to say this as loudly as possible all the work we have done to understand ourselves and our origins needs to be refigured in the light of darwin , and thankfully dennett is both brave enough and smart enough to take the heat and rebound the criticism from numerous sources anyway , here are the facts as offered
this is an amazing book which should be of interest to all those in the general public who are interested in science and the question where did we come from
all i can say is that after reading this book , i had to read all of daniel 's other books very well written book and it makes you realize that no matter how well you know evolution , there are some clever implications of evolutionary algorithm that you may not have considered in the past
there have been many comments on this book in the ten years since it was first published i think what carl sagan said about the book is perhaps the most accurate a breath of fresh air contrary to many other people i thought the book by dennett was easy to read , very well written , very straightforward , and not some sort of heavy philosophical discussion he has lots of examples and many references to real science it even contains pictures and many schematics the basic point of the book is that despite any rumour or suggestions to the contrary , scientific , social , religious , or otherwise , the basic tenants of darwin 's original ideas for the evolution of the species remains sound , and it is the only viable theory of evolution if anything , it has solidified its standing as a durable and accurate theory of evolution
darwin 's idea is very very simple it goes like this
in the early 90 's , dennett taught a seminar on darwin philosophy most of that college course is in this book with this 500 plus page persuasive treatise , dennett examines every corner of evolutionary theory some aspects of evolutionary theory are established beyond any reasonable scientific doubt other fine points are argued within scientific circles within this book all of the above are discussed in detail and dennett takes on all arguments in every case , dennett leads us to conclude that , in biology , nothing makes sense outside the theory of evolution new discoveries may lead to shifts in the basic theory , but the hope that it will be refuted by some earthshaking breakthrough is about as likely as the hope that we will return to the idea that the sun revolves around the earth
david barrett and todd johnson at the world evangelization research center in richmond , virginia have just completed the 2nd edition of the world christian encyclopedia this 2 , 400 page , 2 volume reference set tells the status of christianity and of evangelization in great detail for every country , people , language , city , and province in the world together with a trove of other information , statistics , and resources for the decision makers in the world of missions a companion cd , the world christian database , is planned to follow this particular work , when complete , will help facilitate the analysis now missing from this monumental enterprise , a truly impressive work of religious , especially christian , demographics there is really nothing like it in terms of sheer raw data
almost 20 years ago the initial edition of the wce was a great advanbce in religious information and statistics the second edition \( now 2 volumes \) reflects much of the change in the religious scene in the last 2 decades and that alone is worthwhile what is interesting is that the projections made 20years ago for the year 2000 have often turned out to be 'spot on' and this adds to the value of the work i commend this latest effort w o reservation and look forward to updates more frequently religion is one of the things that everyone shares we all have it this book should be in every library esp religious ones as a priest who follows and studies and interacts with this world i can recommend it most heartily
professor putnam has written a superb review of the decliine of community in the united states through the end of the 20th century he points to television , urban and suburban sprawl , generational change and changing work habits as being the major causes of the collapse of the american community
i ca n't add anything that is n't already on the backcover putnam has detailed research showing the loss of social capital in the u s and insightful analysis of the implications as well as possible solutions it 's a highly readable book for academics and non academics alike a vital read that will be relevant for years to come
this book definitely gets a little bogged down in statistics at points a couple of the chapters could have been easily trimmed down by a couple paragraphs and tables \( and boy are there a lot of tables \) however , i still think this book is an important contribution to the discussion of american community versus radical individualism
way too full of statistics and other sociological data for my tastes but when it points in the direction i agree with , like any old ideologue it 's hard not to plug it
robert putnam 's book bemoans the declne in civic participation among americans since its heyday in the 50 's and 60 's although few would argue that bridge clubs are n't what they used to be , who would have predicted the rise of 20 , 000 member mega churches back in 1962 \? this underlines the basic problem with this book it focuses too much on what constituted communities and activities in the past , without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today while i agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index , and participation in traditional formal organizations has declined , i would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen for example , while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual party system , college students today volunteer more that any generation before them in addition , while participation in mainline protestant churches has stedily declined , engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically while i personally feel that the sterile suburban , drive everywhere in my suv existance is soul crushing , and the popularity of reality tv may be a sign of the apocolypse , i also do n't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week , while dad worked 9 5 , returned home to supper , and went to the men 's club on tuesdays at 8 and while putnam 's basic premise may resonate with many , its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument
putnam has hit the nail right on the head public policy makers world wide have taken note his constructs of 'bonding'and 'bridging' to the broader community through social networks to add value , or social capital , to society have gained wide currency his research is exhaustive , more than necessary perhaps to make the case for disengagement of citizens but , he has confirmed empirically what so many know intuitively to be true , hence the appeal of his findings his recent work with john helliwell published in the 2004 proceedings of the royal society on social capital and well being , reported in the media as the science of happiness and the object in my own work on positive networking , advances the discipline even further positive networking works , it takes leadership and , when done right , adds social capital to the community putnam 's work is compelling his arguements are powerful highly recommended
i'm resident in germany , i like the workman cat calendar very much and all my friends like it too i think , the calendar could not be better , so each year i order the calendar as a christmas gift for me and my friends !
workman publishing is famous for the bad cat calendars and the 365 kittens a year calendar if you love cats it is more than likely you have either seen these items or own them and buy them every year you can even enter the cat calendar contest and possibly see your very own cats in the calendar the following year what a fun and inventive idea ! this creates some of the best cat pictures you will find because of the wide variety of pictures to choose from each year
this book is high entertaining and intellectually slightly challenging if you like satire , thinking outside the box and subtle humor i recommend it highly
it 's late your spouse says , turn off the light it 's after midnight you mutter , one more chapter this is that kind of book and it 's lol good
lost in a good book may be a painful rite of passage for a linear thinker
i was 'knocked out' by the eyre affair and very sad when i approached the end however , i learned of the next installments and immediately ordered them lost in a good book has been a wonderful read and i have been once again immersed in mr fforde 's wonderful imagination and quixotic characters i pray he keeps his health and writes quickly
if you have n't begun this series by fforde you should
these novels are worth the price of admission just to experience fforde 's imaginative powers plus , where else can you find such a mixture of whimsy , detective fiction and literary references
jasper fforde is seriously bizarre and it shows in his incredibly creative premise for the thursday next series all of these books are very well written and can stand on their own \( as complete novels \) , but if you read the books in sequence thursday next 's story becomes better and better each book answers questions that i did not even know to ask and the story becomes even more satisfying i refused to loan the books out of order to friend , because i felt that she would enjoy the entire series not just the one title that she asked to borrow i highly recommend the entire series and so far anything else jasper fforde has written
i was a bit annoyed by the eyre affair but also intriqued about the book jumping and time travel so i read this sequel and found it to be more fun \) that i am willing to forget my bugs with the first book the jump can happen from to a book , between one book to another , sometimes to something that was not a book at all ! just a 3 4 lines of washing instruction could do the trick \) while the time travel with next 's father was exhilarating
in this sequel to the eyre affair , thursday next must rescue jack schitt of goliath corporation from the pages of the raven , where she left him in the previous book , or else goliath wo n't bring back thursday 's husband , landen , whom they 've erased ! this volume also introduces us to jurisfiction , the counterpart of special ops that exists within books
this more i think about this book , the more thought provoking it becomes first , i find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that 's widely known \( practically a cliche \) , add nothing of substance to it , and actually write a book about it second , i find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the golden rule applicable to business third , and perhaps the most amazing of all , is the fact that i actually spent my own hard earned money on this book what amazing insights did i think would be uncovered \?
in a recent newspaper , in one day enron chief pleads not guilty , adelphia execs found guilty , no retrial in stock scandal and this was just the front page of the business section on that same page , i noted the use of the phrase , ethically amoral have we finally reached a point where we can construct such phrases \? corruption , moral relativism , the meaning of is , have you had enough \?
the application of the golden rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good john maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule , its worldwide acceptance , and how we can apply it to our everyday it was more like a walk down memory lane to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us however i do have a few concerns with mr maxwell 's book first there might need to be a better job at researching fletcher thoughts on relativism in his book he labels fletcher as the father of mordern day realativism quoting \( or rather misquoting \) fletcher 's statement that love can justify anything i am in not postition to defend fletcher , for i am not that familiar with his work , however he does not just use the term love rather he uses the term agape love , coming from the ancient greek the highest and purest form of love one that god would have for us , a term any minister or pastor of the christian faith would know very well second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track this links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track , as it turns into an advertisement for mr maxwell 's corporation , the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of buy buy buy our products not what i expected and was somewhat disappointed in short taking some know concepts , putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored part of the disappointment is that i know this book could be better
excellent book simply written but loaded with information if you are tired of the ups and downs of dieting , this book is very helpful
i found this book to be one of the most life changings books i have read todate the author gives you a really clear path that makes you focus on your life and you as a person the insight that i have gained about myself was really freeing i read the book through once and then i started all over again with chapter one i got a journal and i have begun writing , meditating on the scriptures from the book and really learning how to connect my poor eating habits to the stressful or negative events that occur in my life i will be using this book for the next few years this book can really be applied to any addiction that a person may be dealing with
this is the last weight loss book you will ever need ! thin again teaches the reader how to deal with the inner causes of over eating first i have never read anything like it ! it 's not man made psychological principles that will make permanent changes it 's the application of scripture and the healing ministry of the holy spirit thin again is a gentle , non threatening , non judgmental treatment of the problem of obesity and food addiction i have read volumes on these subjects , but this one changed my life , and i am encouraged for my future as a much thinner person
judy wardell wrote one of the very best , and first , non diet books for achieving desired weight loss thin within then she got married i can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative , insightful writer into a bible beating fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph
i used to participate in weigh down workshop , which had similar guidelines for hunger and fullness , but after multiple problems i encountered with the religious teachings , i dropped the program then a friend told me about 'thin again' which was actually around before weigh down ! what a refreshing alternative , and easy reading ! now i'm back on track with my weight and guilt free !
this was a wonderful book ! this bridges the gap between spirituality and weight loss there are no formulas or forbidden foods just a lot of helpful , soulful advice
i highly recommend this wonderful god given book ! i am a former weigh down workshop coordinator , was searching for a less condemning approach , and god led me to this book ! the hunger scale is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring , uplifting , and healing i believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for it certainly was for me ! it is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small support type group setting
yes , the writer seems to repeat herself a lot in the story i almost thought there were only two characters after reading the first 100 pages but then it grew better , and even more appealing towards the last 100 pages it is a decent novel , and i'm glad i read it it is not as thought provoking as the two novels of anita shreve i read , but i certainly enjoyed the reading
i had never read a danielle steel book before , and decided to give her a try , given that she is so popular and has so many books published i was pretty disappointed i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic however , if a book is unrealistic but well written and engaging , i would still like it i think the biggest problem with this book is the author 's excessive repetitiveness yes , i get that this character is really cold and unloving that was already covered 50 pages ago ! in addition , character traits could have been better conveyed through situations , rather than simply stating , so and so was a devoted mother and repeating this fact again and again and again these flaws in the author 's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms steel 's books it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy , repetitive reading
this the first of daninell 's books i read i learnt that she was the queen of romance novel since i was a teen i'm a little disappointed by the book because it 's really boring for most of the part it 's like reading an alternative version of princess diana 's traffic accident i realize that daniell likes to repeat herself a lot there are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds it 's also too predictable to me , everything that bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all it 's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive this is the major element in the book that really turns me off i have to admit that the last part where anabelle finally convinced bill to be with her is quite touching i think ms steel does have her crowds of fans my boyfriend 's mother had been crying all the way thru the book
the kiss is the second book i have read by danielle steel so far it was great my first book of hers i read was the wedding i highly recommend that one both are excellent books i love romantic books they suit my personality beautifully i even have considered trying to write a love story , with my own experiences real life is a lot better and more complex then fiction ever could be but i do like fiction as much as i love biography or autobiography any genre is fine by me
another romantic novel by danielle steele this time the setting is europe isabelle forrester is stuck in a miserable marriage with a wealthy and obnoxious french man who treats her really bad bill robinson is stuck in a life less marriage to a wife who does not care about him the two come together and over time fall madly in love one night in england , together in a limousine , they give each other a breath taking and long lasting kiss the kiss turns out to be a life changing event for both of them
ms steel is truly the queen of repition she needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor i see that is the ongoing critism of her books i swore i was never going to read another of her soaps \( i ca n't stand those either \) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good i 'll stick with the authours i know i like from now on and i hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite exquisitely , she has worn these out but she 's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers
a must have for anyone who writes or teaches writing or is learning writing my 7 yr old 2d grader loves this book but so do i as a writer and teacher my son finds it easily understandable and it is written in such a way it is fun for him to use as a result he is far ahead of most children his age in his writing skills
i found several parts of this book exceptional , meaning much better than the average grammar book the coverage of first person , second person , and third person writing in both singular and plural forms was well done , including a later section on first , second , and third person pronouns there are also excellent sections on object of preposition and object complement \( yeah , i did n't know what that was either \) the sections on pronouns are extremely complete and go on for pages i did n't realize how many pronouns and types of pronouns there were verb tenses is also covered very thoroughly with many examples of present , past , future , present perfect , past perfect , and future perfect prepositions are covered very thoroughly , including explanations for when they 're used \( to tell location , direction , time , relationship , etc \) and then a list of prepositions
this book it is a great help when i am not sure how to guide my kid very good just followed the rules in this book
since my original language is german it was a great help to have this book now that my daughter is a student in an american school although i understand the basics of english grammar this book showed me steps on how to teach my daughter english grammar without making it too complicated it also helped me refresh my grammar i have also recommended this book to my daughters 1st grade teacher as an ideal companion for any parent whose kids are starting to write stories of their own
i 've recommended this book for people , who want to improve the writing skill i found this book very helpful for foreign people the book contains the basic ideas and good examples
this book is a masterpiece that everyone , student or adult , shouild read it clearly illustrates the fundamentals of good writing and conveys complex ideas in an understandable way mr terban has clearly written the best grammar book on the market and every classroom should have a copy plus , it is a very useful tool for highschool student studying for the sat 's or sat2 's in writing i highly advise anyone who wishes to improve his or her grammar to pick up a copy
i have all of nr books this is one of the few that i have not been able to read i have carried the hard cover book since it was first published , from ma , to california now to new hampshire when packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space i have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there

i loved this story ! i am from a large italian family and i thorougly enjoyed the picture that was portrayed in this book i could picture the city and the small italian restaurant i could also almost taste the food i thought the plot was excellent and the characters were well painted i wished that the person who was the arsonist was a little more difficult to guess it was the most obvious but , i highly recommend the book you could almost smell the smoke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death
great story ! ! excellent in fact my beef is with the narrator and editor
the loving italian family , smart and capable protagonist reena hale , compassionate and good looking boyfriend , and sex off the charts in blue smoke will satisfy loyal roberts fans however , if readers are looking for the afternoon delight kind story sometimes associated with roberts , this book is not for you blue smoke is harsh sadistic rape , murder , and a truly evil sociopathic character may put unsuspecting readers right off but after reading blue smoke , i have even more respect for ms roberts as she shows her ability to work in yet another genre except for some minor logistical problems associated with a handgun during the story 's denouement , blue smoke works it shows that talented writer nora roberts can play with the big girls of this genre \( reichs , gerristen , slaughter , early cornwell , et al \) i hope ms roberts keeps reena hale on hand for a few more adventures good job , nr
perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers those who detested it said it was because of the violence those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts
this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance , skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up
i have been reading romance stories for the last three years , and just as i was getting tired of them , nora comes with something different ! it was an entertaining book to read i particularly liked the timeline that she did following the main characters through years to develop the story line it was also exciting to watch the two romantic heroes to narrowly miss each other over the years and to see them finally met
if you like books on influence that have a strong academic foundation and plenty of real world examples , you 'll like this one and i loved reading it
a very intersting introduction to the psychology of persuation , how everything from car salesman , education , religion , through to cults manipulate their victims the book has certainly made me curious to find out more about the subject and i intend to read guidebooks on how to apply these principles in everyday life
easy to read lots of new material does n't have a sales focus but is still a must for every salesperson
this should be a book that every consumer should read what i find very interesting was that many of the techniques employed by sales people or con artist that was used on me was discribed step by step in this book though i did n't fall for them back then , it was eye opening to see 'their' textbook on persuading you
the first chapter is this book made me sweat i thought i would read this book to continue my study in persuasion just to make me a better marketer , that i was in fact immune against most persuasion not so , says the author his opening chapter about the illusion of invulnerability , shook me it made me realize i'm just as easily swayed by ads and marketing as the next person and so are you this book is a great warning , a powerful education , and a great research tool i 'll use it to improve the marketing i create , but i 'll also remember it the next time someone trys to market anything to me great book get it read it use it joe vitale , author of way too many books to list here
a quick , efficient reference with the most commonly used words for students on the go
a good quick reference book , but i will say that some words are not listed it is focused for 2nd 5th grade in my opinion a handy addition for a home reference library
i use this book in my classroom it helps my students come up with better ways of saying and writing things it is quicker for them to look through than a thesaurus it helps esl students widen their vocabulary easily it also helps me when i work on papers while getting my master 's degree it is a great aid
i was a bookseller and this was one of the most eagerly sought after children 's books of its time and now that i have my own little 'alexander' i am thrilled that it 's still not only available , but doing so well
i can recite most of it from memory , i love it so ! i tell people about it all the time and recommend it \( along with alexander who used to be rich last sunday \) as a staple in every library it 's a great one to have even if you do n't have kids \( sometimes the little buggers show up for visits ! \) this book does a hilarious job of pointing out to kids that some days just stink and that you live through them anyway the illustations have some great humor for the adults read it aloud to someone you love ! aura mae , author of get some hairapy a hairdresser 's prescription for happiness
this book is an interesting read ! it helps make you see that once in a while you may have a bad day but this gives a good example that if you 're having a bad day and just think tomorrow will be a better day children can laugh along and enjoy this book of alexandrer 's bad day
i grew up with this book and today , at the age of 22 , i was cheered up with just the thought of it while having my own horrible , terrible , no good , very bad day
my children grew up with this book and loved it now i 've bought it for my grandchild it 's a timeless , gentle , wonderful little story about how sometimes life just is n't what we want it to be
my daughter , who is 3 , just loved this book she likes to hear about how alexander wants to go to australia
this is a book that every child should read my son thought it was very funny , and we enjoyed it a lot
kids can certainly relate to all the bad things that happen to alexander and they understand the importance of each from getting gum in his hair to a cavity to not even getting the pair of tennis shoes he really wanted , children can commiserate with his woes from their own experiences this book is a great reminder that even though as an adult we may think it is n't a big deal , to a kid it 's a major bummer \( and of course , tomorrow is another day , so things may not be so bad afterall
book 9 in the in death series
generally , i love the in death series , because of eve and roarke i liked this book , but i thought it was so sad when eve was suspended from duty and had to turn her weapon and badge but she did not give up she is a strong woman and i love strong women , because they show real women that they can be just as strong , yet vulnerable
in this series , each story is as interesting as the last eve and roarke 's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring what really made this story of conspiracy in the medical political world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters roarke , feeney , peabody , mcnabb , louise , mira , mavis , whitney , tibble they all work together to make eve dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline the mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing god with people 's lives , including eve 's !
i was wrong ok , i 've admitted it i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels were n't my cup of tea while reading conspiracy in death i realized i could n't have been more wrong i love this futuristic series !
this is one of my favorite series because it blends two of the genres i like most , fantasy sci fi and mystery nevertheless , i have found that in a couple of cases i feel that one of the books in the series is missing something in this one the storyline was not particularly interesting to me , and i think that j d robb did not progress as far as she could with the development of the different characters
my wife got me hooked on this series and i have read it beginning with the first book , naked in death some i enjoyed more that others , however , conspiracy in death is the best one yet ! when eve is faced with not only a complex case of someone who is using great medical skill to kill for no apparent reason , but also with accusations of abuse from another cop , the intensity level keeps rising
this is another chapter in the continuing story of lieutenant eve dallas and her husband , roarke along with the cast of supporting characters feeney , peabody , mcnab , dr mira , mavis , nadine , summerset , et al in the year 2059
i 've read all the in death books published so far and i have to say that conspiracy in death is my favorite i cried when dallas lost her badge \( temporarily , thank goodness \) it was so heart breaking ca n't wait for imitation in death to be published ! the stories get better and better ! ! yahoo jd robb \( aka nora roberts \) !
i bought this book after examining its beautiful pages various times at the bookstore last night i cooked from it for the first time it was a lot of effort , but it did pay off last night i made the deviled chicken thighs my work began sunday with four trips to different stores to assemble the various necessary ingredients yep , two supermarkets , the liquor store , and a bodega \( i live in jersey city , just outside manhattan \) then the next day was the cooking altogether it took me about four hours for that part of the task honestly , halfway through i seriously considered giving up but i persevered , the author 's directions are very precise and very clear , so i just concentrated on completing each step when i was done , my kitchen smelled wonderful \( between peals of the smoke alarm set off by the cooking of chicken in oil \) and i had a beautiful and delicious meal to serve so , my thoughts are this do n't pick this book if you expect a quick and easy meal to toss onto the table this is serious cooking and it takes a lot of work and dedication to get through it but , wow , when you are done , you feel like you 've climbed a mountain , and you have this wonderful meal to show for your efforts also now that i have been through the entire recipe , i bet i can do it again , with much less effort and pull it off again more easily meaning i learned some things about cooking while working my way through it not something you can say about a lot of cookbooks i'm going to put this book aside for a month or so , and then carefully pick a recipe and do it all again i recommend this book heartily to someone who is interested in cooking and most of all learning
i really like this book i has it all ! ! beautiful to look at , fun to read , and very inspiring it is set up nicely too , by season , so you will use the freshest ingredients for me , having the menus laid out is very helpful we will have some fabulous meals from this book
this is a gorgeous book and the recipes are simple , quirky , thoughtful and elegant it 's perfect for someone who does n't have hours so spend in the kitchen , but is looking for something new it is organized around the seasons , and the emphasis is on market fresh ingredients
this book is by far one of the best cookbooks i have while many of the better recipes in the book require a good deal of planning , the reward is well worth the effort !
this book is beautiful , full of great and fantastic recipes and most of all encouraging ms goin tells us that we can do it do n't be intimidated so i made the ricotta gnocchi , several of the pork and chicken dishes outstanding ! buy this book
this cookbook is simply devine suzanne is right on the tip of what american cooking should be about right now her food is modern without being pretentious i love her little comments and tips before each recipe i ca n't wait to try some of the recipes
sunday suppers at lucques seasonal recipes from market to table provides an outstanding set of recipes from a los angeles restaurateur whose cooking has won her accolades since 1998 here are over a hundred of her recipes , arranged into three course menus organized by season lest you worry they are geared for professionals or restaurant owners they 've been edited for home use and are divided into step by step preparation tips for quick and easy reproduction , and paired with color photos to encourage polished results be ready to use some exotic ingredients , though chilled red pepper soup with sumac , basil and lemon yogurt and spiced pork stew with polenta , root vegetables and gremolata provides plenty of flavor and require access to fennel , sumac and other spices and vegetables peculiar to more urban markets
i have n't had much success with cookbooks from celebrity chefs either they 're overly complicated , with pages of ingredients , or they 're the 'food network' type of cookbook \( where one wonders who really came up with the recipes , the author , or a team of testers \) \?
i have n't gotten excited by a cookbook in years but sunday suppers was just the thing to get me back to the kitchen cooking new dishes i love her sense of food and her unpretentious writing also , her focus on local foods from farmers and her simple ways to prepare them never too much nor too little thank you suzanne , for a great book
this book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by anne frank i read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and i visited the anne frank house in amsterdam it was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real i would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site
i have just finished the diary of a young girl and i have the strong feeling that i was moved back in time , as if it was 1944
the diary of a young girl is an inspiring story where i learned about some circumstances and events in the time of world war 2
a year ago , i was forced to read this book by my english teacher at first , looking at the cover , \( it was red with a picture of a girl \) i had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it
this was such a well written book , that you would think an adult wrote to know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as anne 's anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive this book really gives a great picture of what the jewish community went through , all the unjust moves against them it made me gain more respect for all religions and races this book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people we can never understand all the hardships the franks went through , but we can help those going through similar persecution
it was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the nazis during wwii i highly recommend this book and i hope i can one day go see the anne frank museum where the family lived during this time
zero coupon bonds are the bonds spoken of in the book 's title zero coupon bonds do well in falling interest rate and stable , low interest rate investing environments as we had 90 of the time from 1982 to 2004 now is not the time to use this book 's advice , wait until interest rates fall again \( 2010 \? \? \)
having read many books on various financial subjects , this one is on my list as one of the top 10 wastes of time in fact i am only writting this to hopefully save you time ! warning ! when the reviews are from annonymous 'a reader' be suspicious
i agree with much of what has already been said as far as the amount of filler and the editorial glitches and can anyone figure out the last chart table 11 1 \? these numbers make no sense and do n't even correspond with the info on table 9 1 i began the book with some excitement but ended up feeling very uncertain about the method
i bought this book because i wanted to learn more about investment products other than common stocks instead , \( in the book on tape \) , i got 5 10 minutes about the different types of bonds , a little detail about t bills , and the frank admission that this book does n't really discuss corporate bonds what ! \? the whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 for that , i must say he was prescient \( too bad i did n't read this in 1999 ! \) more time is spent describing the basics of common stocks , and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds ! oh and that wrong formula for computing the price sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version i actually had to rewind the tape to see if i had heard correctly
the method of btdwb is good , but the book is very poor ! ! ! there is serious mistake in the method described dont forget to go to corrections to 17 simple steps to super returns for a further reading \( you can find it in amazon website editorial reviews \) but the correction is still containing mistake please note the gold price of the example in corrections to 17 simple steps to super returns !
although there are some holes , they do not ruin the basic info provided i think that in trying to keep it simple , o'higgins might have made it too simple in the end he shows that this is a strategy that doesnt take alot of complicated research to use and that is the true beauty it is especially relevant in todays stock market
i really liked this book the author gives you information the media ignore he even tells you what the media are really like best of all , the information put forth in the book is right from scripture a must read for all who want to know the truth

from keen insights into media bias , to refreshing keys to israel 's proper role in world affairs , dateline jerusalem is packed with hard hitting analysis plus new and startling information what is the palestinian agenda \? will israel survive in today 's hostile climate \? can america win the war on terror \? what end times events are just around the corner \? after giving his testimony in the first chapter , zola devotes chapters to the jews , muslims , palestinians , the government , media , education , churches , end times and , finally , questions and answers brilliant book highly recommend it !
i'm a polytheist and the author is a christian who converted from judaism those are both monotheistic religions \( to me , they are both atheistic religions , given that there is n't any difference to me between believing in one god or zero \) so why did i read this book \? because the author and i are both zionists ! and i want to see what he has to say
this is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a home based business a big , big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities it is critically important to maintain visibility , and that takes a concerted effort ! publicity must be part of the strategy for success and it especially important for home based businesses i'm not talking about advertising i'm talking about community visibility personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are , what you do , and why they should buy from you or work with you the women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big , big payoff certainly all home based operations will not hit the one million mark but that 's not a bad goal to keep in mind ! \( reviewed by marion e gold author of the personal publicity planner a guide to marketing you and top cops profiles of women in command
in millionaire women success secrets of sixteen who made it from home , marketing professional and lecturer jeanne torrence hauer draws upon her more than twenty years of experience to create a primer for financial success , enhanced with the careers of women who achieved millionaire status in the male dominated business world written specifically for women who aspire to become millionaires in their own right , millionaire women combines brief biographies with savvy strategies and sound advice for making a business grow into a major operation millionaire women is enthusiastically recommended as an upbeat , go getter guide which is packed from cover to cover with examples and advice applicable to women seeking to make their mark in the highly competitive marketplace , be it local , regional , national , or international
jeanne torrence hauer really put together quite an inspirational book each of her sixteen subjects were unique in their own experiences she presents them in such a way that i did not want to put the book down this is a must read for anyone who is looking to change the path their life is taking or would just like to be entertained by the successes of others this book would make a good gift
i was really moved by this book i felt the lose of a love in a family and the total destruction of a marriage and what could have been slowly slipping away from two people who had loved one another and they watched as the grew so far apart
most cops are criminals
browsing the bookstore 's true crime section last month in search of a page turner i had n't already read , i spied an unfamiliar jacket paul larosa 's tacoma confidential the synopsis was riveting i only hoped the reading would be half as good as the compelling details promised
the detailed research has resulted in a wonderful narrative which makes a great read the sad story of these star crossed partners is
david brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife whom he raped repeatedly and terrorized certain members of his department , mostly the women he harassed and tormented his wife
paul larosa did such an extensive investigation it was as if he was there himself watching this brutal marriage and the lives and death of david brame and his wife chrystal you ca n't put this book down for minute so much research in the details of this horrible crime , from the family to david 's co workers to everyone around the both of them paul larosa is an incredible author and ca n't wait to read his next book this book is a must read
larosa has done an excellent job of presenting the facts of this tragic case in concise , easy to read detail i grew up in tacoma and one of my closest childhood friends was one of the first gig harbor police officers on the scene larosa 's account of the events leading up to crystal brame 's murder and david brame 's suicide meshed completely with what was going on behind the scenes that only the police knew about at the time tackling the issue of spousal abuse is never easy it 's even more difficult when one of the parties involved is in a high profile position of power what could have easily been a cumbersome , he said she said book became a solid true crime story through larosa 's obviously well researched words the area , the people and the aftermath were vividly portrayed i highly recommend this book
i had never heard about this case so i did n't know what to expect when i started the book it immediately had a you are there ring to it because of the easy flow and the details and descriptions it read like a novel this is such a sad story , especially for the children how sick does a man have to be before somebody notices and does something about it \? do these psychopathic men really hide their evil so well \? i can think of scott peterson , of course , and laurie hacking 's husband , as well as others and david brame fits right in with them nobody notices the sickness in these men until it is all over and their wives are dead \? it is so sad in any case , this was a very well written book and i am going to check to see if paul larosa has written any others
mr larosa has done a very good job of laying out the information , in a balanced manner , concerning a tragic incident that had a very convoluted and contentious history he also rightly raises important questions that remain in the aftermath and deserve to be asked this book is well written and its reading moves quickly
the brame murder suicide was big news in this area for a long time i did n't really expect to learn too much new from a book however , i did learn a lot the author has done extensive investigation into the circumstances of the marriage , separation and relationships of this couple the book was more balanced than i would have expected too in general , the story has been told with all the good on the side of crystal and all the evil on the side of david this book told the other side too , in case the reader wants to make up his her own mind the theory at the end about how the shootings occurred was interesting and made sense to me well worth reading
this review refers to the penguin classics edition of henry mayhew 's 'london labour and the london poor' which is an abridged version of the original four volume version published in 1851 52
henry mayhew , founder of punch magazine , wrote this four volume sociological classic during the 1850 's if you are at all interested in the victorian era , in british history , in london , or in urban history in general , this is a must read the penguin version is abridged and is a distillation of the best of the multiple volume set this distillation is itself over 500 pages , so imagine the impact of the entire set ! the utter destitution of the london poor is set out in such vivid detail than one cannot help being shocked at the conditions human beings were forced to live in in the greatest city of its time the only fault i find with this book is mayhew 's occasional lapses into preaching otherwise a fine boo
i really enjoyed this book and thought some of the theories were monumental maybe we are just a simulation right this moment , we do not know actually the vibration we are is a simulation from stillness , maybe \?
even though the book is controversial and presents ideas and theories that will appear far fetched and unproven , it is still worth reading
imagine the entire cosmos conquered by nanotech self replicating machines \? that 's just one of the far out ideas to chew on in this book even if the whole theory does n't hang together , a lot of the parts are extremely interesting
while i appreciate what tipler was attempting to accomplish , he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective skip this one !
tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist , but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how god and immortality after death might make sense i only skimmed the book , but i have to say that , as a physicist , i was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than i expected
tipler says many times as i have proved huh \? what the f is he talking about \? there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth he 's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book i 'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense , but i do n't think it should matter i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts , and tipler just does n't make any sense his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time the more books you read , the sooner you know when to stop reading , put the book down , and read a work of fiction instead , which can play with such ideas without boring you to death
i ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest tipler 's theory of immortality , in a nutshell , is the following 1 \) the planet earth and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in 1 billion years 2 \) man will make self learning and self replicating machines \( can windows xp do that \? \) that will colonize , over millions of years , our galaxay and , eventually , the entire universe 3 \) these machines will be capable of individual thoughts , emotions , etc and are essentially alive 4 \) as the universe begins to collapse , the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe 5 \) all the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one super being at the center of the collapsing universe this super being is the omega point 6 \) the omega point , via its all knowledge of all things will be able make emulations \( exact duplicates \) of all biospheres , including earth within these emulations , individual humans \( you and me ! \) will be emulated thus we will again be alive as these beings in these emulations will be unable to tell if they 're real or virtual presto immortality for all the book \( theory \) reeks of circular logic and assumptions it 's an interesting theory , but it 's just that , an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist ps tipler denies the resurection of christ and in the last chapter admits to being an aetheist \( i wonder if he 's a god fearing aetheist \?
one of the top five , if not the most interesting book , i have ever read if you are familar with any omega point theories , this is another one , but tipler attempts to incorporate more traditionaly christian elements as opposed to hegel or spinoza like view of reality i am not a religious believer myself , but if you have even the slightest interest in how a traditional theology might be merged with science , this book is definitely worth your attention
when i recieved the essay 's of warren buffett , i have to admit i was disapointed i could gather the essays from mr buffet 's annual reports myself however , the book 's organization is where the value lays the author has spliced together associated topics from various essays in a manner that makes it appear that they were part of one to begin with what results is an invaluable source on mr buffett 's thinking on a broad range of subjects and how some of his positions have evolved over time i was truly happy that i did not disregard what i initially percieved to be a poor purchase on my part enjoy
short and sweet , this book is a collection of warren buffetts essays ! he one of the riches and most financially savy men in the world , he might not be 100 right 100 of the time , but he is damn close !

this excellent book was hard to put down mr buffett is as innately talented a writer as he is a businessman the book funny , entertaining and highly informative , is sure to add significantly to the knowledge of any aspiring investor buffett takes topics like corporate accounting malfeasance and makes you laugh at them while at the same time providing profound insight into the inner workings of the corporate enviornment this title is definatly one you will want to own
by analyzing the essays warren buffet has written over the years , a reader can obtain a general , intuitive , though non technical guide \( for that intelligent investor \) to warren buffet 's investment method although appearing to be common sensical in it 's folksy mid western prose , essays explains in succinct and clear detail buffet 's fundamental analysis of businesses among these are a strict adherence to full disclosure of accounting transactions , the concept of economic goodwill , and confidence in conservative , factually confident and integrity filled management decisions a solid , yet gap filled introduction to buffet 's value based investing principles
this is a collection of valuable insights on how to determine real economic value , as opposed to accounting value , accounting gimmicks or financial nonsense
for all of you investors who want to invest like warren buffett that is , successfully this is what you really want to read there are a large and growing number of books out there that will claim to make you think act be like buffett here you can actually read his thoughts as wb has often said , go to the source material \( not the analyst reports , etc \) to make your judgments , and that is true in studying buffett as well
buffett has a very uniquly apt understanding of many modern business practices and investment strategy along with the ability to explain these concepts in a down to earth framework i highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt they did n't understand what was going on in corporate america
this book very effectively organizes warren buffet 's essays cunningham extracts selected passages of buffet 's essays from 1979 to 2000 and organizes them into chapters this is a great summary of buffet 's essays and well worth reading all of buffet 's letters for berkshire hathaway shareholders can be seen on the berkshire hathaway website
most of the reviews that i have written for amazon are based on the books , the dvds , and the cds that i already own i occasionally buy a new product via amazon , but i mostly review the stuff that i already own
waiting for godot was dubbed a tragicomedy and there does n't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play the random and wandering personalities of vladimir and estragon , the main characters , lend an amusing air to the entire work however , their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy \( and irritation \) , though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you unless one goes into waiting for godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing , and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be knowing a little bit about beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable , but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own what i love the most about this book is beckett 's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality vladimir and estragon are most certainly not your average joe , but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous waiting for gogot is really what you make it , because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men , it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale go in looking for a meaning , and knowing how beckett means to get things across , and i think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold a short read , and worthwhile , i would say , at least for its originality and humor
samuel beckett 's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them is godot god \? are didi and gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive , or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering \?
some think waiting for godot is an argument for existentialism others believe it is about man 's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question neither seem correct
i'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with , but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work , however , is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel it 's akin to the random scribblings of a two year old or a mud splattered canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind , it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis , because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal though look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes and brilliant artistry of the play
waiting for godot is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork , in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value in this case , however , what is behind the artwork is a non concept , the impossibility of creating a masterpiece after the monumental impossibility of joyce 's finnegans wake , what remains for the serious artist \? waiting for godot is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world in that sense , this play is the last masterpiece of high art the torch has now passed to movies and popular forms
samuel beckett 's , soon to be classic , drama about two men , vlad and estro , transcends stage play drama beckett 's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic , literal story
many readers of 'waiting for godot' obsess about the identity of godot and whether he represents god or any other almighty being it is unlikely that beckett was referring to god as the man for whom the characters are waiting , as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in beckett 's theatre
waiting for godot , a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes , attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with it is a call to action this play is packed with nonsensical dialogue the plot does not exsist yet , once we realized that waiting for godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense at least in subtle ways much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality , but , that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century it 's enigmatic , a puzzle of words , poetry , and philosophy i recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge the play is short and does not take too much commitment take a quiet evening and give it a shot what are you waiting for
dave kindred has done lovers of sports and history a favor with sound and fury
sound and fury \( 14 hours , 11 cds , unabridged , blackstone audio \) is a duel biography of howard cosell and mohammed ali
david kindred has written what amounts to a duel biography of the controversial odd couple that is muhammad ali and howard cosell the author tells us that ali elected to not join the military because the muslim nation told him not to to cross them was to literary toy with his life the assassination of malcolm x being used as an example while not necessarily agreeing with ali 's decision cosell supported ali stating that taking his heavyweight championship away from him without any semblance of due process was completely wrong there appears to be evidence that cosell may have already been experiencing dementia when he came out with his second book entitled i never played the game aware of the criticism in his book of his cronies in the tv booth for monday night football cosell was asked before publication whether he wanted to include these strong opinions since he always prided himself on telling it like it is he felt it would be hypocrisy of him not to do so now cosell was a devoted family man while ali ventured into nocturnal delights it was hard for sports fans to be neutral in regard to either of these men , but boxing was the ingredient that brought these two men together first in mutural respect and then in friendship incidentally , page 247 has a hilarious anecdote of howard using his colorful vocabulary in breaking up fisticuffs involving teens in kansas city whether you are a fan of either man or the part they played in sports you will find this to be an extremely enjoyable book to read
howard cosell and muhammad ali are american icons one turned sports broadcasting upside down , the other energized and stylized sports in this country both displayed extraordinary courage and conviction both were one helluva lot of fun
the praise given dave kindred 's book sound and fury two powerful lives , one fateful friendship on its back cover does n't even begin to do it justice this tri biography of muhammad ali , howard cosell , and the partnership between the two , is a wonderful book and a novel concept that only a few had the knowledge , connections and talent to write thankfully for all of us , kindred has
may your feet always be swift ,
this is the first book by kindred that i 've read i knew of him mostly as a columnist for the sporting news who seemed to dislike everyone and everything , especially anything new or unusual but i have always been fascinated by both cosell and ali , and was willing to give this a shot thankfully this is one of the best sports books of recent years cosell and ali as individuals and their relationship \( which in reality took place almost fully onscreen \) is covered in full , but the author also shows these incredibly complex characters , warts and all , as they maneuver through their respective careers
mr kindred is a wonderful storyteller in this very readable dual biography of two controversial men muhammad ali and howard cosell like beyond glory 2005 by david margolick \( which tells another story of a white man and a black man linked by history in the 1930 's \) , sound and fury is a history of a later era , the chaotic 1960 's , and a history of two outsiders mr margolick makes clear that their relationship was less of a friendship and more of a partnership the two of them never hung out socially but each saw the other as a genius in their domain who could further their respective careers this book is a wonderful introduction to their lives for any reader who was born after the time when muhammad ali and howard cosell had already come and gone , and as a reminder to those of us who were there
for those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s , the sound and fury is a wondrous re telling of the period through the lives of two unlikely partners , howard cosell and muhammad ali it is not a boxing book it is a work of social history , responsibly reported and told dave kindred 's superior writing and interviewing have made a book that should last for many years the tales of cosell 's and ali 's lives , each up from bootstraps , and their accidental friendship , will impress even the most jaded sports fans and grownups
never read anything like this , much like i 've never read anything like house of leaves , much like i 've never read anything like only revolutions conclusion mark z danielewski is the best writer going today
one of the most compelling parts of the brilliant house of leaves was appendix ii , part e the whalestoe letters
i 've read house of leaves twice , and neither time i felt like i was able to get through pelafina 's letters however , it was much easier to read all of them in the whalestoe letters perhaps because they are all included in proper sequence \? the introduction is nice as well
many great writer 's from kurt vonnegut to h p lovecraft have taken elements of there stories and used them again so you ca n't criticize danielewski for that and of course it 's not going to be as good as house of leaves house of leaves had more to it it is a good book as a sort of sidestory to house of leaves
overall i thought the book was good it starts at the basics , explaining aperature , film speed , etc a good overview of all the different types of photography \( landscape , portraits , etc \) is also included the only complaint i have is the book is a little dated the majority of the book covers film cameras , with only a small section on digital cameras however , i just bought my first digital slr and many of the features it has are just like the older film cameras the book describes so , it was still relevant
a few weeks ago my digital camera quit working at a very bad time i had to break out my twenty year old 35mm film camera and use it i was stunned at the quality that my old yaschica had over my digital camera so i bought this wonderful book and never looked back it is filled with great tips that are easy to understand tips on how to use differant lenses , filters and film not to mention great flash tips that almost eliminate red eye my wife and friends are amazed at the quality of some of the pictures that i have taken plus digital pictures wo n't last but a few years stored on disk and a negative is almost forever so if you want your memories to last a lifetime break out the old 35mm film camera and buy this book ! ! ! !
excellent book for beginner photographers or even for persons who would just like to take better family or vacation pictures
this is a wonderful book for starting in photography it 's only problem is that , even in its latest edition , it treats digital as a new technology that has yet to enter mainstream it just dates itself in several ways , such as saying that aps is also a new technology really the techniques it gives are wonderfull no matter what , its just the equipment guide to 'choosing a camera that needs to be updated
i bought this book because i just bought a canon g2 , and wanted to learn the basics to take advantage of the features of my new camera prior to this book , i have no idea what aperture or depth of field mean i finished this book in one sitting very easy and engaging book to read for beginners i like how it covers many of the common scenarios , such as shooting at night , shooting at mid day and when to use manual adjustment to accommendate difficult shots i can say now after reading the book , i feel confident to take on the many features of my camera , and i 'll definitely come back to it for reference in the coming days
wright presents no new information about al qaeda , leaves out plenty of information about al qaeda and neglects the usa side of the road to 9 11 understanding qutb 's radicalization of islam is important to understanding why ayman al zawahiri and usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the usa found a use for them as an enemy what cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the united states by the neoconservatives and followers of leo strauss the united states is not a unique and beautiful snowflake the liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by strauss as destructive of the society of the usa and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about us exceptionalism after the the soviet union was kicked out of afghanistan , both qutb and strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it since the cold war the us has been working off of the friend and enemy model of policy formulated by carl schmitt and 9 11 presented the us with what schmitt called a state of exemption if you think jihad was the cause of 9 11 , ask yourself why richard clarke found bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to iraq hours after 9 11 see the bbc documentary , the power of nightmares or from secularism to jihad sayyid qutb and the foundations of radical islamism by adnan a musallam or the political ideas of leo strauss by shadia drury for a better analysis of qutb and strauss than wright has in his book if you prefer to stick with fiction about the road to 9 11 , check out patrick s johnston 's novel mission accomplished
this book made me realize we must not forget and we need to boost our information gathering procedures we are not isolated and we need to be aware that our world has changed forever after 9 1
the looming tower is a very good book about the modern beginnings of islamic radicalism the book 's timeline starts in 1948 with the banishment of an egyptian to america and progresses to the childhood of ayman al zawahiri and osama bin laden and their transformation to islamic fanatics wright presents some of the individuals pursuing al qaeda , including one who wanted to kill bin laden but was denied , and another who wanted to arrest him i watched the interview with lawrence wright on amazon com and after reading his book was left with the opposite impression about the war with islamic radicalism his take was that we are creating more terrorists by fighting them while my belief that radical muslims are motivated more by idealogy rather than as a result of our actions or any other country 's was reaffirmed it seems that they are driven by a desire to bring about worldwide islamic domination this book is well researched and easy to read i enjoyed this book for the history of al qaeda and would recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about islamic radicalism
i bought this book to get a better understanding of the al qaeda movement , the muslim religion and the politics of the middle east despite being a learned person in some areas , and somewhat knowledgeable in others , i must admit that i knew very little about the middle east , its countries and history this book was a starting place for me it explained the birth of al qaeda in brutal arab prisons , the life of osama bin laden , his growth into a rebel and then an extremist and finally to the lack of communication between the fbi and cia which helped to lead up to the travesty of september 11 , 2001 i must admit that i would have to read it again to absorb all of the details , and i might lawrence wright has written an excellent well researched and readable book , i highly recommend it
i can not laud this book too highly it is meticulously researched and intelligently presented
someone had just sent me a documentary film called loose change which makes a case for the us government being responsible for blowing up the world trade centre this book blows that little theory right out of the water
i found this to be very well researched and full of interesting information , however it took a lot of concentration to keep all of the carachters apart i learned much about how the militant terrorists justify their actions and was dumfounded by how poor the cooperation between our anti terrorist agencies was definitely worth the effort to read it
well researched book and well written it 's amazing to trace the formation and progress of al qaed
a must read for anyone who wants to understand 9 11 well written , objective , and factual , it 's the scariest book i 've ever read this is a warning and we must take heed
this book is divided into short reviews of various historic sites across the us it 's a great learning experience to read about some of the sites loewen gives the history of the site , including why it was established and often what the politics were at the time there 's some amusing information about misinformation that the sites portray i have truly enjoyed reading this , and because of the way it 's set up , it 's easy to read in short bursts when you just have a few minutes
i first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the mining hall of fame i actually know about this museum in leadville co the author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of big business to promote their agenda this museum actually took many years of interested individuals' efforts to create the author seems to be upset because the museum does n't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact this museum was never intended to do that there are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this the mining hall of fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the us many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the us , but also the world the author is critical because the type of people he would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented , and alludes to racism he uses an example of a native american discovering uranium in the 1950 's in new mexico , and asking why this person is not in the hall of fame gee , could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before \? after all , they did mine uranium in nm for the atomic bomb during the 1940 's i did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book
lies across america is a wolf in sheep 's clothing disguised behind this book 's apparently innocuous political correctness lies a new form of pernicious censorship even though the author claims that he has no intent to rip down monuments , much of his reasoning is deeply flawed instead of doing original research into the various subjects that he writes on , like a good professor should do , he summarizes a book , says it presents correct conclusions , and then says that the old thinking is wrong case in point , is the chapter on the burning of columbia , south carolina during the civil war instead of looking at all the evidence on what happened when sherman marched into the city in 1865 , loewen quotes two books which he seems to think draw the correct conclusions , and says that sherman really had nothing to do with burning the city thus , almost all the historical markers in columbia are wrong , or so loewen seems to hold not the most convincing argument
did you know that , in language backdated from the mccarthy era , helen keller was a com symp , a communist sympathizer \? well , no , because that would n't be so edifying
lies across america what our historic sites get wrong is an excellent book by james loewen he starts first with the western half of the united states since most history textbooks start with the eastern side all of the information about historical markers is broken up into small sections for easy reading loewen proceeds to give state by state accounts of historical markers and their errors or in some cases their silliness many of the markers honor people as heroes who were in fact overt racists other markers are notorious for telling one side of the story most of the markers in the south dealing with the confederacy are found to slant towards confederate sentiments or just to omit what really happened at historic confederate sites we also find out that many markers dealing with native americans would refer to them as savages or other racist terms in many instances i was appalled by the honoring of people like jeffrey amherst in massachusetts who intentionally initiated the spread of smallpox among native americans to exterminate them from the landscape loewen also points out our country has never been able to come to terms with gay or lesbian leaders and honor them you can take a tour of willa cather 's original home in nebraska but never once hear anything mentioned about her being a lesbian another instance of outright silliness is when plantation homes talk endlessly about silverware while you tour them but fail to mention anything to do with who built the homes , did the work there , and were held in bondage to the owners these are just some of the things that you 'll find contained in this book
it took me 3 years to read this book should i end the review now \? it 's not because i am an extremely busy person , or because the book was so enormous that i read it endlessly for that long no , the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it 's just not very good as excellent as lies my teacher told me was , this was equally bad
leaving not a state or an oppression unturned , lies across america is the enormous , exhaustive sequel of kinds to lies my teacher told me , taking a look at the monuments and markers across america that overwhelmingly paint a dishonest and unrelentingly positive view of america 's past what he provides here is n't just vital history , it tells the vital sociological truth about history 's continued impact on regional landscapes many have complained that his section of the south is too long and too anti confederate \( it 's now controversial to be anti confederate \? \) but why it 's such an important section is in representing the continued oppression and inequality of the region as part of a process of sugarcoating our history and who was disenfranchised in the process plus , his points demand to be considered never has a work so thoughtfully , credibly , and humorously elucidated the flaws and implications in the way we tell history read this book with an open mind , and you 'll never look the same way at our use of the word discovered \( a loaded euro centric term that denies people living in certain areas for hundreds of years \) , the undertones and occasionally overtones that glorify racism in countless southern monuments , or the continued dialogue between how to represent historical items in a specific time and representing what actually happened this is a book whose importance in representing both the past and present cannot be overstated
james loewen is an academic scholar who feels very strongly about the misinformation presented at places of historical significance this book presents a listing of ninety five historic sites , historic parks , and historic markers that do n't quite get the story correct arranged in the book from west to east , each state in the u s includes at least one listing and some states have several they all have one thing in common they either lie outright or they present misleading information about what took place
what happened in the past is the past and what we say about it is history , james w loewen says as he opens lies across america \( 21 \) in the course of 95 vignettes loewen demonstrates that much of the time history , as it is presented to the public through historic sites across the country , takes the form of non controversial hogwash loewen points out that historic site visitors should realize that each location tells two stories the story of the event or person it is commemorating and the story of its erection or preservation the former is the truth and the latter is what those who erected or preserved the monument want the general public to think is the truth loewen argues many erectors suffer from the heritage syndrome , the impulse to only remember what is attractive or flattering and ignore all the rest \( 47 \)
good insight into the mind of a talented thinker unfortunately he dwindles of toward the end , but definitely worth reading
tolstoy really hit on the fact that people work their whole lives in pursuit of something that will make them truly happy the more i get the happier i 'll be it does n't work like that even at his best he was miserable , suicidal the answer is god plain and simple he is the only thing that tolstoy discovered would lead him to a more peaceful , satisfying life this was a great book
the starting point of this work always fascinated me here is a great genius of mankind , recognized throughout the world as an immortal creator of literature he is the father of a large family and has a wife he has loved and who has loved him he has great wealth in other words here is a person who seems to have almost everything most human beings strive for in their lives and do not attain in any way close to the level at which he has attained them and yet it all turns meaningless to him , and he in despair asks the question of whether there is anything to truly live for , what can give life true meaning for he too senses that death will take him and all his worlds , and their meaning away
tolstoy 's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing his writing is so personal and open that i do n't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved i was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active god in the conclusion of his search
tolstoy 's confession was written during his time of deep internal spiritual struggle upon his renunciation of a life of aristocratic wealth and worldly pleasure , tolstoy longed for the sense of true peace that he saw in the peasant class thus he embarked upon a search for meaning and happiness through a life of simple faith , manual labor , and poverty he formulated his own chrisian philosophy based on christ 's sermon on the mount stressing the existence of the kingdom of god within the human heart , civil disobedience , and total pacifism this law of love is explored deeply in confessional form throughout this autobiographical work although this particular approach to living the life in christ ultimately did not cultivate in tolstoy the deep inner peace that he yearned for , i feel that many of his ideas can be beneficial to people both within the church as well as not regardless of the validity of his doctrine , it cannot be denied that this is an authentic , genuine , and very human confession of a man searching for god and some meaning to life on earth although i personally disagree with many of tolstoy 's points , i still hold his confession to be a universal work that deserves a fair exploration by all who have ever felt a similar need for inner peace and true reconciliation with god
tolstoy 's personal account of the existential crisis he faced after having published war amp peace and anna karenina if you 've ever laid awake late at night wondering , what will come from what i am doing now , and may do tomorrow \? what will come of my whole life \? then tolstoy 's confession is a book for you
i'm a student who takes a philosophy class every semester , despite the fact that it does absolutely nothing for my graduation requirements i always do well in the philosophy classes , but there is one part i hate the reading i was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person the words and semantics in philosophy , meant to clarify arguments when spoken , simply seemed a muddle to me when read so it was with trepidation that i picked up my latest assignment tolstoy 's confession i read it , and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed here , finally , was what i 'd been looking for the on the road of philosophy , the self effacing jack kerouac of the field everyone who 's had worries about the fleeting nature of life and everyone who 's worried that it all means nothing , this is your book
what a surprise from the title and cover art i was expecting a 4th of july my country `tis of thee stand at attention and salute book full of patriotic drivel but this is a very substantial and thoughtful study of america 's institutions and its critics and the author has a gift for straightforward , easy to understand exposition
alaister cooke became famous in britain via his regular broadcasts termed 'letter from america , whereby he attempted to explain current events within america to a british audience
this is a smooth , easy and short read d 'souza ideas have a nice and consistant flow to them that makes this a pleasure to read with out making this a war n peace dissertation on some of the cultural warfare present in our day
got the audio book and his arguments are cogent and well reasoned
dinesh d'souza is the thomas paine of our day his insight , logic , grasp of the english language , and wit make him , i believe , the best political author alive
this book says absolutely nothing about the condition that america is in today it says nothing about american history , nor the american people it is just a collection of mindless warblings , fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right i would not recommend this even for kitty litter burn it
without any prior knowledge of this book 's contents and my urgency to find a book for a particular class of mine , i chose what 's so great about america solely based on the title , and i must say i was not let down as i read the title , the question filled many thoughts in my head and made my curiosity run wild
dinesh d'souza , who emigrated here from calcutta in 1978 , displays a level of ignorance of american history , politics , economics and culture that is laughable but for the immigration reform act of 1965 which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat d'souza as their pet token , yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises d'souza probably would n't even be in this country for him to accuse both pat buchanan and the rev jesse jackson of hating america demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse do n't bother
this book explains the reason why so many people bad mouth the u s and american culture , but yet , millions want to move to the u s either short term or long term the truth is , the u s provides the best life in terms of wealth and freedom , and they just ca n't get that back home the book is by a man who moved here , and explains , from the outside in , why the u s is so great
in fact , this a very good book for someone interested in this style of investing \( ie buying a handfull of rental houses for bettter or earlier retirement \) its easy to read and i found several important points not covered in some of the more famous books you prolly needs to read a few more books before beginning an investment enterprise , but this shold be one of them
this is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified there is one major problem , the author talks very little about risk
this is my 3rd book on real estate investing and i must say that each is totally different , with different ideas and different strategies i think it 's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know
this book has gotten me excited about getting into single family rentals , while at the same time , it 's not letting me get too hyped up in getting rich quick \( as rich as you want to be \)

the second edition of this title was released january , 2006 however , amazon com takes most searches to this page for the old edition to get to the page for the second edition , click above on other editions the second edition is the same price but you 'll get 25 more pages , and 10 of the old pages have been edited or replaced to bring them up to date
i first read this book three years ago and it still stands as one of the best books i have ever read on real estate investing if you have read any amount of rei books you know that this area of publishing it is flooded with 'motivational' books that are full of fluff and short on details \( rich dad series comes to mind \) suzanne p thomas 's book delivers the real info that you are looking for she offers pro insights on cashflow , down payment , selecting a property , different loans to consider , marketing , finding the best tenants , day to day details , etc the focus is on single family rentals , but the info can be applied to most real estate investing situations if you are a beginner investor this is the book you want to start with
this book is ideal for the novice investor or beginner investor looking to get into rental houses i read the first edition of this book and was very impressed i then read the second edition and was pleasantly surprised at the amount new info the author updated a lot and added a lot of additional info , so if you have read the first edition already , it 's certainly still worth reading the second
i 've read this book 3 times it is written very clearly with specifics about the author 's experiences in purchasing and managing rental homes , very little fluff geared more towards beginning investors , but intermediate investors will also pick up some good tips
since this is one of many previous reviews , i will be brief this is one of the most extraordinary novels i have ever read but not the easiest one the first time i read it i felt overwhelmed and undereducated , until i saw a another book written as a companion to the novel it helped a lot with the unfamiliar cultural references , of which there are many and i felt better i read it a second time , on a couple of flights back and forth across the pacific \( perfect place you 're captive , with few distractions \) and it took a few more hours than that to finish in the end , if you can read no other novel , or if you are going to be isolated on an island with no chance of escape , and can take a book to read , take this one you wo n't regret it
i truly feel sorry for pynchon , knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life by all means , if you want to read it , get it from the library as i strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery does anyone really care that a man 's sexual episodes predict german v rockets falling on england \? is it really important to world literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from \? the so called intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same great thinkers that believe ulysses by james joyce is the best novel of all time i would rather read the worse writing of de balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels both these novels are truly sound and fury signifying nothing
perhaps extreme paranoia is one way out of , or at least our only healing response to our existential loneliness \( the other way , of course , is love , but this takes a second place in pynchon 's world view \) they have done this to me , i am their victim , is perhaps a more comforting world view , than i am completely irrelevant at least one can have some kind of fun or meaning to life in finding out who they are and why they have done it
since there are already 250 reviews of this book , i am just going to say that the earlier portion of the book may contain the very best english language prose style ever written even better than joyce and nabokov ! oh , and also , pynchon was not only robbed of a pulitzer prize , but also \( so far \) of a highly deserved nobel prize \( also true of john ashbery \)
i lived in germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station someone had just walked off and left it after about ten pages , realizing that pynchon was an intellectual rip off artist , i secured it a trash can where no one could find it i like to think i protect the public from pollution
rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite perfectly exemplifies the great post modern con a chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed , so much like a certain nostradomus
i was expecting a real blockbuster ending to this series , and i was a bit disappointed i thought the killers would turn out to be people way more involved in the series , and i was disappointed that they were really fringe characters i felt let down by that
working a case in central america , fbi agent connor shields stumbles across a horrifying sight dozens of young children being herded into a cargo truck , obviously doomed to a future of slavery or as unwilling participants in the international child sex trade conflicted because he 's on a very important mission , connor is about to intervene when he 's accosted by a colleague who assures him that everything is under control , that both local and us authorities are on the case
good , but not great stewart tries a little too hard in this book it 's still good , and i would recommend reading it , but it 's not worth reading at the hardcover price
if you have n't read the first three books in mariah stewarts dead series dead wrong , dead certain , and dead even go pick up a copy today although not necessary to enjoy dead end , you 'll get a much better feel for some of the main characters plus just three really good reads if you read the other books first
anne marie mccall is a psychologist and one of the fbi 's most skilled profilers she is still grieving for her dead fiance , special agent dylan shields , who was killed more than two years earlier in an undercover operation that turned sour pennsylvania detective evan crosby is now annie 's lover , but he is having a hard time competing with dylan 's memory after a nasty quarrel with annie , evan suggests that both he and annie reexamine dylan 's death to see if they can uncover any fresh leads little does the couple know that by opening up this old case , they are trespassing into dangerous territory
in december 2002 , fbi agent shields had completed his mission in santa estela , central america he was on the docks , en route to the boat that would begin his journey back to the states , when he stumbled upon men and vehicles in the process of buying children it was a child slave trade obviously as shields pondered what he should do , his cousin \( another agent \) appeared and informed him that the child slave ring would end that very night shields met his boat contact and went home , secure in the knowledge that his cousin 's team would save the children
in avon county , pennsylvania , homicide detective evan crosby is sick when he sees the fourth victim in under a month each casualty was pretty young female , ages 12 14 , attending a private school , and left without shoes his lover , fbi profiler annie marie mccall tries to give him solace , but knows how difficult coping with this case is
i 'll keep my review pretty short pretty much all the good points the other reviewers wrote are pretty much true so i 'll just add my two cents
this book is amazing ! it is a very engaging read and never gets stale the knowledge you get out of it is priceless the tactics i learned in this book were very successful when applied to swing trading for me highly recommend
well , amazon invited me to write a review about this book
this is an easy to read book with very specific trade setups and easy to follow instructions so far after 2 weeks using the morning gap play it is consistently profitable if you 've traded you know two weeks does n't prove anything , but it 's nice to see something work right off the bat a couple of his plays in the book i'm not comfortable with but i have n't tried them , and a couple of them require buying his tradestation codes , to be fair he does tell you how they work so if you want to code them yourself you could no wishy washy theory here , just simple to follow set ups with profit targets with stop loss and real good advice on risk and amount of account needed per contract and how to wright a trading business plan and some info on computers overall a good book
well , i wrote about 10 reviews on trading books so far , so that should clear off some doubts of the previous reviewer
every reviewer rates this an exceptional book and every reviewer has only rated one book , this one is n't that strange \( rhetorical question \) i read a great many reviews of trading books go to a book by elder or one of the other market gurus and you 'll find reviewers who have read and reviewed scads of trading books there 's of course no way for me to know , but maybe the author 's real talent is writing trading book reviews
i bought this book due to the excellent reviews and i agree with all the 5 stars that everyone has given it
there are at least 10 , 000 trading books out there i know because i have probably read half of them i also believe i have learned something from every one of them most of the books are like doctors , they specialize in one area or another this book , mastering the trade is different its the general practioner that really knows what he is doing
a hands on authentic book very practical easy to follow excellent focus on the psychology of trading and the management of trading
this is an excellent text , which will allow you to become a decent beginning trader carter discusses psychology , computers , trading platforms , quote software , market sentiment indicators , and gives you 8 trading setups a brilliant book
outstanding book ! mark provides very practical examples of promoting your product or service it is easy to read and there is plenty of white spaces on each page this makes it easy for any type of notation and ease of use of the highlighter i read the book in one sitting while awaiting my delayed flight and i was excited after reading the book and i was not upset with the delayed flight the only section i disliked in the book was the section on magic but i understand his viewpoint of why he wrote about magic buy a copy and see how you can profit rather quickly and learn about magic
i bought this book because i have read article written by mark before he is an excellent writer and very clearly presents difficult information he goes above and beyond on this book it was hard to put down even when it was 1 am i have read it once and put it aside for a few days to digest all that he gives you i have it on my calendar to pick up and reread again next week it may take a time or two through the book to truly get it \( and by get it i mean absorb it , believe it and implement it \) he provides concrete examples , concise practical laws of marketing and business building an excellent read and worth multiples to your business if you implement even 1 100th of the information he provides
i consider myself a marketing expert i 've built two hugely successful million dollar mail order companies within just a few years and thought i knew ever trick in the book from gary halbert to dan kennedy
i found this book really enlightening , both from a business and a personal perspective mark 's writing style is relaxed and friendly which made the book an easy read it is also very clear no room for ambiguity i especially liked his comment on think and grow rich it has certainly made me think about reading a book versus acting on the information shared in the book
at around 200 pages , the irresistible offer is not exactly a hefty tome actually , author mark joyner had to use a few formatting tricks to get the book up to even that modest page count one cannot guage the value of a book by its size , though
the irresistible offer gives you a simple formula to use in marketing your product or service
mark joyner is that well known in the marketing world you wonder if he can actually live up to his own reputation in a book
mark joyner gets straight to the point he explains in plain language the exact steps you need to take sell your product or service he explains exactly what makes a business stand out above their competitors , and how you can do it too
just started and finished this book in one four hour run in marketing there is one genuine good book out of ten copycats this is one of the genuine ones
good read for those who want to market their product or service with the power of words and psychology a must read for anyone in the advertising industry
the history of the book when it was published tells it all after a media blitz and great anticipation with what would be written due to brando pocketing an absolutely huge advance the sales were so abysmal that it was discounted by fifty percent or more less than two weeks after sitting mostly unsold on store shelves
after i read marlon brando 's own memoirs , my view on him changed that he was one of the most brilliant actors in history is a fact most people are aware of , but what fewer know is that he was a very intelligent man who helped discriminated folk groups more than many i knew this even before i read this book , songs my mother taught me but what i was not aware of , was how sensitive and funny he could be when he felt comfortable i believe much of his tough behavior simply was an image not all the time , of course , he was very masculine and could which he admits in this book be brutal at times , but this side of him is obviously exaggerated by the press through the years
i haven't read this book as it was a present to my mother i heard good reviews about it on the wbai radio here in new york
marlon brando in my opinion is the world 's greatest actor this autobiography is one of the best i have ever read if not the absolute best i own several biographies , and often , i get bored , put the book down , and never touch it again
this book provides great insight into marlon brando , the man , and his view of the world and himself in it marked by poignant , eloquent , intelligent , and fascinating interludes on philosophy , history , and perhaps most surprisingly the craft of acting itself , readers will enjoy getting to know the brando behind the tabloid images and salacious gossip mongers brando also almost succeeds in his thinly veiled project of deconstructing his own myth perhaps betraying just how deeply his father 's early and constant beratements of his abilities and potential affected him \( you 'll never amount to anything \) , brando cannot seem to believe that he did anything out of the ordinary he is beyond disparaging about his own acting and dismissive of his titanic achievements in cinema , art , and cultural redefinition generally considered the finest actor of all time , brando in two separate decades twice revolutionized acting and redefined the medium he was a liberal and a humanitarian eminently more interested in making a contribution to humankind in some other \( in his words , more important \) endeavor than acting he several times states that not all is black and white , it is a polka dot world , and he is understanding of the shortcomings of others yet he is a harsh judge of himself and seems to view his own life in either or terms he succeeded in important ways in helping mankind or he frittered away his talents on the meaningless if lucrative game of acting still , his achievement as well as the pervasiveness of his cultural influence \( think blue jeans and t shirts \) , despite his own discounting of it here , was remarkable sensitive , thoroughly enjoyable , very funny , and exceedingly humble , this memoir is not complete , but it gives us a window into the mind of one of the most remarkable and influential personalities of the last century
brando was also a terrific storyteller this book puts to rest so many rumors and gives an honest self appraisal of this large and largely misunderstood genius his life was filled with deepest tragedy , but brando managed to stay positive and he kept his killer sense of humor the book is funny ! brando was an actor , but also a humanitarian and a true friend to those without a voice i encourage fans to hear his story from his own voice , rather than one of the many gossip filled bios available
the paradox that is marlon brando has always been the allure for me , besides the obvious brillance as an actor i'm far from alone in my opinion i think it was appropriate that he did n't write about his marriages and children such things , as we know , are private matters too painful and complex confessionals and tell all autobiographies are not interesting anyway , and rarely do they reveal the true character of their subjects i learned a lot about who brando was just by reading his description of autumn leaves in libertyville and the night sky over tetiaroa
before reading songs my mother taught me , i recommend printing out a copy of brando 's filmography from imdb com and then watch as many of his films that you can find this will help you enjoy the book , because brando assumes the reader has watched the films he talks about i watched most of his movies and became a fan
ok , so this book is a bit old now and i found it late but the advice is timeless and very useful unlike so many decorating books that are just filled with pictures of beautiful rooms in beautiful homes , this book gives you some basic principles so you can make your own stuff beautiful in your own home some of the decorating that i had already done in my home i really like , and this book tells me the principle behind what i did why i like it some of the decorating i have done in my own home i do n't like , and this book tells me what i can do to fix it
for those who say this book is boring and has too many rules , i would ask if all the 10 , 000 books out there full of glossy photos and little explanation were all that helpful , why did you need to buy this book in the first place \? decorating is like any other creative profession the foundation of the magic that a good decorator can provide actually consists of basic principles that can be learned by anyone oh , and i think the reason some of the photos appear dated is that we are used to seeing design books incorporating the latest trends she used photos of real homes , which , i'm sure , contained furniture that the owners had been collecting for years that 's kind of the point of this book
no other book has ever shown us novice decorators how to light a room , arrange our art and furniture as well as this one it is easy to follow and sticks to its promise that we do not have to buy all new furniture to make our home look really pretty
the good the author 's room plans actually take into account furniture placement around windows and glass doors as well as entry points her examples show real homes with odd , mismatched furniture clear before and after pictures and floor plans , even if they are in black and white she has some good rules of thumb to at least think of , which you may or may not agree with , and tends toward the neutral \( white beige \) as far as paint you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art she tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room
once in a while a book has a great impact on your life and use what you have decorating is one of those books for me my house looks like i brought in an expensive decorator but i did it myself just from what i learned by reading it

if i could have given this book ten stars , i would have christopher lowell and his seven layers of design should have taken a page from laurie ward 's excellent book which was practical , easy to read and sensible the before and after pictures of a variety of rooms helped greatly she was right in less than 1 2 hour , using her principles i transformed my crowded , awkwardly arrange living room into a beautiful and stunning arrangement that encourages conversation and looks much larger at the same time
i have n't read all the 100 reviews already written for this book , so my apologies if i point out things that have already been said
the writer 's book of hope , released in 2003 , continues to be a beacon of hope to those on the long and tumultuous path to publication
keyes does a great job presenting the case for finding hope in the writing process this book specifically discusses dealing with anxiety , frustration and despair , overcoming the discouragers in your life , exorcising excuses for not writing and pursuing a career in writing , the rites of rejection , the nature of publishers and editors , and how to keep hope alive
every writer needs hope and hope is what i always get when i read and reread ralph keyes 's book , the writer 's book of hope
ralph keyes' books about writing have helped pull my ambition out of a tail spin twice his first , the courage to write , helped me finish my first novel , which eventually got published the follow up to that , the writer 's book of hope , helped me get started on my fourth book , at a point when i was beginning to feel frustrated with both the business of writing and the relentlessly demanding craft of it what keyes does in this book and in the first is to map out the tricky and sometimes dangerous emotional landscape of writing , and he does it by giving us examples and anecdotes from famous and sometimes legendary writers who 've had similar frustrations better than practically any book on writing out there , the writer 's book of hope offers those of us who spend our days in front of typewriters and computers making up worlds with words the boost we need to carry on and keyes does this not with some sugar coated inspirational messages , but with honest , realistic and historical examinations of the traditional difficulties that all writers , regardless of their fame or lack or it , face and how they have coped and kept writing highly recommended
yes , i bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing
this book really opened my eyes to the reality of the publishing world it also helped disapate a lot of anger and self pity i was feeling who knew you had to work this hard \? well , now i do so it goes i can now forge ahead without feeling so sorry for myself
this book had great practical advice for each stage in your child 's reading life particularly helpful were the suggestions on overcoming difficult stages when children might tend to become apathetic towards reading i also appreciated the emphasis on the total experience of reading , rather than the simple ability to identify words on a page in addition i found it reassuring to hear that my husband 's and my own enjoyment of reading will go a long way towards influencing our kid 's desire to read
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer , imho it has romance , treasure hunting , and a little magic really great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down i read it several years ago
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters , and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep sea diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed , maybe because i did not want it to end ! also , i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state , the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree , the blue green water , the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read , however i am an avid jd robb reader
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her , it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet , romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book , whether you like romance novels or not
first , let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books , more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read , her stories tend to be very formulaic , and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's , for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before , my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books , this one went against convention in many ways , while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship , but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain , but the love story was touching as other readers have said , i liked how she spread it out over the years , which made it slightly more realistic , and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short , if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan , give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered , but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men , and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream
i am a huge reader of history , and this is one of my favorites of all time while full of interesting facts and stories , it is set apart from most books by the depth of the analysis it provides it walks the line between history and social science , hinting at a theory of civilization and capitalism based on case studies from around the world though professional it is not dry \( though i am infamous for enjoying a good dry book \) my only criticism of it is the parts where it ventures into the cyclic theory of history this is a european \( or french \) historiographic technique of trying to edition long recurring cycles frankly i find the concept forced \( even more frankly , it 's bunk ! \) and it always annoys me when i come across it but it is part of the historical tradition braudel was involved in , so it must simply be tolerated as a blemish on an otherwise stunning achievement
braudel was one of the greatest economic historians of all time his scope alone was incredible but what in the end hurt him and significantly diminished his findings was his unfamiliarity with the work of harold innis , whose landmark empire and communications was published a quarter century before braudel published this book in the original french
among the reviewers , i am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement it is a mixture of facts and speculation , with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them there is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded , and i have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be in fact , this is a self indulgent exercise in historical erudition i do n't care what anybody else says , this is a philosophy rather than history book the author gives a lot of facts , but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts the author tries to integrate almost everything under the sun into this tome , and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information
this book is a linear commentary on the little things in life each page and comment has a picture of an animal that adds meaning to the comment almost always in a make you smile or outright laugh kind of way
i love this book everytime i read it i get something else from it my kids like it to because of the great animal pictures i have let co workers borrow it and they had to buy their own wonderful for all ages
would recommend the book for anyone looking for a lightly thought provoking ideas
we all have those cast off generic gift books that lay around in some unused corner of our dwelling you know , the books with children 's letters to the tooth fairy , or little flowery poems about mothers these books are hastily bought up from hallmark stores and walgreens each generic holiday and tossed in a gift bag with some half rate chocolates and a crumy 99 cent card in our last dash effort to conjure up a last minute gift these are usually obligatory gifts that we feel we have to give , even though we may really love and care about the recipient and feel like a jerk because we ca n't think of something else , at the last minute , to gift them with on our way to aunt helga 's family reunion , late as usual two days later , your gift book finds its self laying with other passed on rejects at the inventory check in counter of your local used bookstore while the clerk groans to see yet another gifty bound volume of mushy valentines prose being continuously re gifted is the career of these books until some kind soul mercifully chucks them to the trash heap with a mighty swing of disgusted zeal
this book is a cute light hearted flip book that does not take itself too seriously i highly recommend it
i first noticed this book in a hallmark store , bought it to give to someone , and read it myself first the photos are top quality shots mostly of animals mimicking various human emotions and situations they are the light side of the book the text is more weighty , but brief i 'd even call it profound put together , they give the reader a fun , yet meaningful reading experience that makes an impact i 've since purchased additional copies for gifts
as someone who always says i am looking for the meaning of life , this title caught my eye \( even though i did n't think it actually contained the answer \) it does tell you that you need to find your own meaning \( guess i knew that \) but the quotes are so true and the pictures so cute , i thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that i am on the right path i look forward to the day when i 'll be excited about beginning another day and be filled with heartfelt joy sounds great to me !
i really enjoyed the counterpoint of these beautiful and sometimes humorous black and white animal photographs
i'm thankful that i was able to get this book at the library and did n't spend 15 00 buying it i own the blue day book by the same author and i think it 's fantastic and it cheers me up right away he should have stopped with that book it claims to be a witty , thought provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who 's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way the only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures it did have one thought that i really liked some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge if that 's true , then why do smart people dress so badly \?
a simple , predictable , yet powerful story of an old school pitcher , shaara 's novel is a classic baseball tale billy chapel , a future hall of famer who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club , decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves he is not interested in money \( yes , this is an obvious work of fiction \) , and pitches primarily for his love of the game
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels , and because i'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there
heard for love of the game by michael sahara ,
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book , it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it , even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion , i could be wrong
this book was eye opening for me to apply personalities and personal relationships between washington , jefferson , franklin , hamilton and of course adams among others the vibrant times of enlightened thought in the formation of the country with the declaration of independence then in the midst of war and politics and thereafter the early years of forming the constitution and the political infighting was very interesting these were passionate men who lived in an incedible time i never had seen these founding fathers as real people before this book
i purchased this audiobook for my husband , who listens to books while he works he never watches movies a second time and he never listens to books twice but after checking this out from the library , he talked about this book so much he ended up checking it again he continued to fill me in on the life story of john adams and told me several times that he would n't mind owning this one ! needless to say , he made it easy for me to decide on an anniversary gift this year and he could n't have been happier
i decided to read this book after enjoying 1776 i was instantly enthralled by the life of john adams mccollough is such an interesting writer and this book has been thoroughly researched i became quite connected to john adams during my reading , and i was moved to tears at several points in the book i knew so little about him before reading this biography , but when i completed this book i felt like i had lost a dear friend in addition to his personal life , the reader will learn more about the continental congress , the declaration of independance , the forming of the u s government , early u s foreign relations , and of course all of the interesting men and women who lived during the early years of the formation of the new country this is a wonderful , compelling read
the book biggest strength is that it uses many quotations of john adams , abigail , john quincy adams , and jefferson to tell its tale these people were intelligent and very good writers i enjoyed the biography i enjoyed mccullough 's writing style and the leisurely pace he sets for himself the biography clearly portrays a man who lived long , did many great things , and died at peace with himself the book glosses over adams' weaknesses and i thought spent way too much time on what jefferson and adams thought of each other , but these are minor flaws i enjoyed morris 's biography of roosevelt more , but this book was a good summer read and was far better than mccullough 's 1776 i learned how this nation owes a great debt to this great , but flawed man
like another reviewer , my interest in history is quite new the author 's presentation of john adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man david mccullough 's excerpting of adams' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation while mr adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego , he , at the same time was critical of his own limitations even with this conflict , adams could still say , i thank god that he gave me stubborness when i am right
first of all , i did not exactly 'read' this biography instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work \( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way , and still been able to read many more technology related books \)
this book is n't really for legal scholars , serious historians or those interested in adams' writings it is , however , a very well written personal biography of a great figure in american history with a special emphasis on trying to understand the hows and whys of adams , how he responded to criticism , how he came to conclusions , why he made the decisions he came to etc it is difficult to provide enough color sometimes when presenting such a 'long' life and mccullough i am sure had difficulty deciding when to slow the narrative to dwell on important events when there were so many to choose from all and all , a very solid , thoughtful mainstream work
what a fantastic way to learn about john adams ! what a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing !
as a newer student of history i'm fascinated by all of the research and reconstruction that goes into putting together biographies of some of our early leaders this book is no exception the story at times becomes a little bogged down in details that can distract , but overall the reading is easy and the content stays with the reader
simply outstanding mccullough brings history alive it 's not history , it 's a real story it may not be perfect historically , but it 's pretty darn good and there is no such thing as perfect anyway when it comes to history it is perfect , however , when it comes to conveying it 's vivid , it 's fully understandable , it 's exciting , and it 's not hyped because history at that period of time and the life and role of adams was so exciting i love it i love it i love it
i wonder if the creators of that operating system had this book , would anyone know of bill gates or microsoft or if xerox held its research and development of the paperless office , would the information technology field be totally different yeah you know where i am going with this
i think i know how this book was written a whole lot of cut and paste from u s law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in if you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law , fine but this is not the series to do it in
unlike the rest of the rich dad books that i 've read which were for the most part fantastic this book was terrible michael lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field , but he is an absolutely horrendous writer the intro by robert kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of ip protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me and no real life examples of anything just references to a couple hypothetical horror stories that he relays at the beginning of the book the only reason i gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least i was able to get some basic definitions of ip terms down but i guess i could 've gotten that from a dictionary too
micheal lechter has done us all a valuable favor by writing this book ! as an experienced attorney dealing with copyrights , patents , and trademarks , his experience , illustrations and insights are priceless ! if you are a business owner , investor , inventor , author , or doing just about anything that has income potential beyond a 9 5 job , then you need to read , absorb and apply the knowledge of this book to protect yourself from the competition and thieves out there who would like to profit from your intellectual property at your expense this is a must read as a part of your overall business and investment education i also recommend all of robert kiyosaki 's rich dad books , and thus far , all the rich dad advisor series that i have read \( of which this book is a part \) are also worthy of your time and investment
i hear michael on cnet radio on online tonight with david lawrence i 've just finished reading protecting your 1 assets and was really happy to get it it was filled with answers and it really helped give me focus for goals i had at the office in particular , it hit home in regards to the importance of protection this is not an easy subject to find good information about michaels book really made it much easier for me to learn what to do and how to avoid some of the nightmares i was almost ready to discover first hand
i read the book and thought it was an excellent primer in intellectual property law i also spoke to a friend of mine who works in a large law firm \( 100 \) attorneys in milwaukee he told me that the attorneys in the ip department in this prestigious firm use this book as a reference i think that speaks quite highly of the book i strongly recommend it
although i have found robert kiyosaki 's books to be excellent , i am so unimpressed , bored , and resentful of this book basically , it is almost 300 pages of this phrase right here get professional help there done you have now read the book i agree with many of the other reviews here , in that it really is n't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas , but only helpful to kiyosaki and the author this is an advisor series book , and it has made me skeptical of the rest of them sales dogs is also not helpful unless you are already experienced in sales
this is my wifes rating since she finished the book and i have only started so far , i agree it 's another completely different area of the country which make her books so interesting
i 've been tearing through nevada barr 's anna pigeon mysteries ever since i discovered them the tighest and best story in my opinion is firestorm this one was a little harder to follow and i'm not sure i ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery but like with all the pigeon novels , the characters and physical setting were interesting and well drawn , and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing , such as the relationship between anna and her sister , and the relationship between anna and frederick the fbi agent \( be prepared to be surprised ! \) i do n't think i'm going to read anything else until i 've finished all the anna pigeon books out there on to blind descent !
i love listening to this book as cindy williams has an enjoyable voice and does a good job reading the story is enjoyable as well but it is so changed from the book at times it bares little resembelence to it i am not referring to the fact it is abridged and much is left out i refer to the fact for example that a character that is a man in the book is a woman on the tape such changes alter the structure of the story and make it into a different story than the one you expect to hear if you have not read the book this is a moot point but if you have your in for some surprises
anna is in the south again but this time on one of the islands off the coast of georgia and she 's not 'wrastlin' gators this time , it 's turtles instead there 's a plane crash , bambi \( real name , flicka \) , cannibus \( marijuana \) , and more she 's still contemplating moving to chicago to be with the distant frederick , but that possibility seems to always be on the backburner as usual , nevada fights the good fight , goes skinny dipping , gets her hair cut , and is finally free of her ex husband \( in a hilarious manner \) , while discovering the the secrets of cumberland island 's murders
i was not familiar with thomas friedman 's new york times columns this book contains a sampling of his columns the book mainly portrays the difference in the arab vs the culture of the west the book opens with the shock of the events of 9 11 , considered a tragedy by the west and a cause for celebration for many places in the arab and muslim world
friedman 's writing is consistently thoughtful , and this book is no exception i appreciate deeply the care with which this book has been prepared it belongs in every thinking person 's library
thomas friedman 's longitudes and attitudes is a very readable book based on a collection of columns he wrote for the new york times just before the attacks of 9 11 and for the year following those attacks the last quarter of the book contains a kind of diary in which he attempts to put into context where he was in the world when he wrote these columns and how he was personally feeling at the time
this book is a collection of newspaper columns and journal entries that friedman wrote before and after the september 11th attacks friedman is very familiar with the middle east , having been a news correspondent in beirut and jerusalem for ten years before becoming foreign affairs columnist for the new york times although he himself had stressed that one consequence of globalization has been the creation of super empowered individuals with a grudge against the united states , and that bin laden was just such an individual \( the lexus and the olive tree \) , even friedman did not see it coming on september 11th , 2001 this book features reprints of friedman 's columns analyzing the reasons why the september 11th attacks happened , and the reaction in the following months throughout the islamic world the book also includes a short journal section , in which friedman describes his travels in the middle east while he was collecting material for his columns
i remember back in the day when i was a blind follower of michael moore and al franken thinking that tom friedman was some right wing jerk for no real reason either , he just seemed to fit that mold to an extremely naive liberal it certainly makes me uncomfortable to think back to those days , because i am now a pragmatic and realistic moderate and i certainly had friedman pegged wrong \( and also because i now realize moore and franken are mostly useless \)
when i bought this book , i did n't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of friedman 's collumns in the times i think friedman is a great author with lots of great insights , but he is n't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as i would have liked in a bunch of detached 750 1000 word segments since the sections are arranged chronologically , there also is n't the opportunity to tie the themes together
tom friedman has a regular column in the new york times i have always loved his columns and this book is excellent \( it is actually a collection of his ny times columns \) a must read for anyone who is interested in politics in the middle east , terrorism and its origin and the iraq war
tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts webs and walls states v markets v individuals and the comprehensive failure of the arab street , leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day are extremely well thought out from reading this compilation of nyt columns , i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best selling book , 'the world is flat ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions , his ability to see the big picture is spot on
may not make you wise
written in the context of the cold war , the author emphasizes the need for free markets and an open society for a society to property function it stresses the importance of the individual and the needs of the individual against the backdrop of an ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country era and the basic economic honesty of selfishness in general there are several ideas in the book that probably need to be revisited \( which is why you should read it \) since they are becoming issues again in today 's world
an all time favorite of mine , capitalism freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of free markets and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the state 's distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations from the \( classic \) liberal 's perspective , this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government , and strictly limits the appropriateness of state involvement in society , particularly with regard to well intentioned programs and policy
this book probably should not be treated as capitalist manifesto a la marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous galbraith the affluent society \( 1958 \) reading the book without reading galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian \( anarcho capitalist \) style but as a polemic with galbraith vision of post capitalism \( post industrial society \) the book looks like an interesting historical document
in only 202 pages \( who said professors ca n't boil things down to the essentials \? \) free market solutions are outlined to address some of our most serious problems this is a win win book the ideas contained in it , if properly applied , could improve our economy and enhance our freedom at the same time
milton friedman , now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia capitalism and freedom dispels the so called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society the book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made however , they are points that never go out of sytle he refutes the lie that the free market caused the depression \( it was actually a tyrannical federal reserve \) , that socialism can be democratic , and others friedman discusses public education , roads , minimum wage laws \( which he calls , the most anti black law on the books , \) , as well as the how so called progressive tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor
one of my faves friedman was one of the best also read the road to serfdom by f a hayek

this book is the apotheosis of freedom friedman should be studied not only by economists but also by politicians
milton friedman is one of the great economic thinkers of the 20th century based out of the university of chicago , this nobel prize winner in economics has consistently and cogently argued for the benefits of capitalism over any other form of economic organization this , along with free to choose are his two major works establishing and explaining his beliefs within it , he argues against many established policies in the us federal government such as the minimum wage , subsidies , rent controls , and licensing requirements for practice in fields such as medicine and law likewise , he argues for many market orientated alternatives to today 's arrangements , such as increasing the use of school vouchers
it is amazing how little has changed in our political dialogue in the 40 years since this book was written friedman had chapters about social responsibility of business , taxes and incentives , free trade , vouchers and the role of government in the education system , and fair distributions of income , and trade protectionism to protect domestic industries and workers from unfair foreign competition
i like these first , but then i just stopped reading them , and i have no idea why
these books are some of the most incredibly creative and oringinal books i have ever read i may be seventeen but i absolutley love thse books my best friend ashton let me borrow them and i read the first one and i was hooked no other author i have read can write as cleverly as he can i could never choose a favorite , i love every one
the books i received were in very good condition i feel it took a bit long to actually receive the items especially due to the fact that i have ordered from other vendors before and saw a much faster turnaround

my title is way to simplistic for this story , but it gives you an idea tananarive due brings us a unique look into suspense and horror that i have not seen before , giving us a cultural lesson at the same time an engrossing read i could n't put it down
from the minute i opened the book i could n't stop reading it 's refreshing to read such an entertaining novel from start to finish !
i absolutely loved this novel i usually read l a banks vampire huntress series but i decided in a slight change of pace and boy did i get it the story is about a woman trying to run away from her tragic past , with her child gone from a freak accident angela does n't know how to bounce back after advice from a friend she decides to pick up the pieces from its point of origin , her grandmother 's old house
i listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel , and what can i say \? i loved it i 've never read anything before by this author , but the narration , the spinechilling series of events and the loveable characters made me want to read more i sincerely hope there is a sequel
not very scary , too long , and poor character development there are a lot of good reviews about the book maybe i missed something
i found the good house to be an exceptionally well written and suspenseful novel the author did an excellent job of developing the story and the characters
i really enjoyed this book it kept me guessing what would happen next i did n't want to put it down
angela toussaint has nothing but warm , wonderful memories of her grandmother marie , and summers at the good house and while her haitian grandmother evokes only thoughts of goodness in angela , the fact is that her grandmother was a very powerful voodoo priestess who was widely known for her powers angela is also blissfully unaware that many years prior her grandmother , driven to do so by anger , pride and a need for vengeance , summoned a spirit that would only mean death and destruction for her descendants being the powerful priestess that she was , she was able to put the demon to sleep where it has lay dormant within the earth of the good house all of these years returning to the small town of sacajawea , washington with her son cory as she has done many times before , a simple task of cleaning the attic has sparked young corey 's curiosity in his grandmother and before you know it , he is pouring through her book of spells and trying some of her magic magic that eventually unleashes the fury of a being that has been dormant for almost a century , bringing with it death and destruction to all of the toussaints
ripping off king , but with more sex , shallower characters , and a hollywood ending leave it on the shelf
a must for dog owners and a guide to go by for 'do it yourself' instead of costly obedience classes
the intelligence of dogs by stanley coren takes a unique approach to assessing the intelligence of our canine companions coren is a psychologist and animal behaviorist and uses some innovative methods , typically used to measure human intelligence , on dogs he gives interesting background information on canines and how philosophers once viewed them as biological machines incapable of thinking or feeling this book would be helpful to a person trying to decide on a breed for a pet because of the breed specific information provided i highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in man 's best friend and whats going on in his mind
this was a book that i found absolutely delightful to read since i am a thorough going dog nut the topic seized my attention immediately , and dr coren did not disappoint his style is lucid and thankfully free of a lot of jargon this made for pleasant and informative reading enjoy
the press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit unfortunately it did not live up to that notice the author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously

in this the intelligence of dogs a guide to the thoughts , emotions , and inner lives of our canine companions , stanley coren looks at how dogs think and what they feel by analyzing their actions he begins by providing a persuading argument that dogs do think and show emotions then an interesting history is given of the views on the dog 's mind throughout history , along with the three main proposed views of what dogs were first domesticated and used by people coren provides a few sections that are especially useful in interpreting what your dog is thinking or trying to say i am a veterinary assistant and am around a lot of dogs all day , and these lists did provide me with some new information
i ca n't believe i did n't know anything about this time in us history before the chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating this book is very well written you 'd think a book about architecture might be dry , but its really not at all highly recommend this book its a slo a great book for a book club
one of the best books ever , and i read 2 a mont
as a criminologist , i have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one the research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook , so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures this is a must read for anyone interested history , the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the victim offender relationship bravo to mr larson
reads like a murder mystery , but represents itself as being factual a really incredible story and a piece that should be read by all chicagoans \( i live in colorado but was born there \) fran
extraordinarily well written highly recommeded for anyone interested in , not just chicago history , but turn of the century events
a fascinating look into chicago 's life and times at the end of the 19th century with the background of the world 's fair and the personalities of the major movers and shakers of the era
a strangly fascinating book did n't expect it to be so engrossing lived in chicago for a time , and find i knew little about the history
i learned some odd new things reading this fascinating book made me do more research on the exposition
this book had me from the first line a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction two stories are told side by side , one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes jack the ripper pale by comparison the result is a book that is almost impossible to put down it left me with an appreciation of the energy , talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world 's fair and the genius of inventors like george ferris
not only is the story heartwarming , the artwork is beautiful besides having this book in my personal library , i have purchased several copies for friends with dogs and give it as remembrance when their beloved pet goes to the rainbow bridge it is definitely appropriate for any occasion , but there is a certain comfort when it is received during the difficult time after a pet is gone anyone who loves dogs , has to love this book
for anyone who has loved and or lost a dog , this book is peace for the soul since not many people know how to express condolences over the loss of a pet , this is a great place to make a memorial steve did a great job expressing the love and joy of having a k9 friend with his humor and expressive illustrations
while attending a conference in vermont , i was fascinated by several woodcuts of dogs by folk artist stephen huneck which were displayed in a local craft store the ones which particularly caught my interest involved labrador retrievers engaged in simple tasks which captured the essence of the breed , e g loyalty , friendliness , joyfulfulness , and perserverance i then noticed that the artist also had published three children 's books incorporating woodcuts of his black labrador retriever sally at the beach , in the mountains , and on the farm however , the book to which i was drawn both by the storyline and the pictures supplementing and illustrating the text was the dog chapel i learned that the author and his wife in fact live in st johnsbury , vt with their four dogs and that he has constructed the dog chapel on his farm as a place that welcomes visitors of all creeds and all breeds , but with no dogmas allowed
this book is amazing i recently lost my beloved companion of 9 years , and when i saw this book i had to buy it i am proud to say i'm originally from vermont and have been a fan of steven huneck for years he has outdone himself with the dog chapel the illustrations and simple phrases reflect the love between a dog and his person i miss my friend , but huneck 's book has helped me to grieve and heal
mr hunek conveys the power of the animal human bond through beautiful photos of the chapel and whimsical woodcuts that describe the characteristics of our canine companions the book tells how this unique chapel came to be built following the authors critical illness as the sign outside the chapel says , all breeds and all creeds welcome no dogma allowed this book would make a cherished gift for all dog lovers regardless of their religious or spiritual beliefs
this is a wonderful book for the creative spirit or crafty mom instead of spending your hard earned cash on flimsy costumes that may get only one wear , you can make your own it includes a multitude of colorful photos and easy to follow , step by step instructions to make many exciting and unique costumes some of them include a king , robot , knight in shining armour , magician , cowboy and hula girl this would be a great book to use for halloween costumes as well as for dress up and role play many of the costumes can be made by kids themselves it will save you money and the kids will have a great time
i enjoyed this book because most of the items for making the costumes you can find around the house
this book is creepy
ask a king fan what book is his best , and you will most likely hear it or the stand as the answer maybe the occasional the shining , or you may have asked a dark tower fan who puts those books above and beyond the rest of the canon
king did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one there were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing for the most part , not bad would make a good movie
not to take anything away from my favorite author but i thought the book was way too long the story was suspenseful and descriptive but i found myself getting lost in the superfluous background \( and this is someone who has read the stand at least six times so it 's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline \) stephen king fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as the cell which i thought was great
it 's amazing how fast king drew me into this story then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two , and after that i just read on like a man possessed a few bits feel plotted , but i do n't care king 's novels have never been about their plots that 's news to hollywood , i think , but not to you and me
it may seem self indulgent for king to make his protagonist a writer of romantic suspense king sounded a bit defensive on the promotional tape his publisher sent reviewers wambaugh was a cop , and he writes about cops , king says you have to write about what you know , he goes on , just like he writes about maine
i read about one hundred pages and then , when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding , i quit this was my first king book and i am not rushing out to buy another one , especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages
four years back , a friend introduced me to dean koontz i fell in love , and started buying his books koontz was a name i never knew , but stephen king was a name i grew up on i was hooked on koontz , and realized i wanted to give the same chance to king someone in a similar genre \( whose name i recognized \)
bag of bones presents a mystery suspense sans the typical gore of stephen king i am a fan of king and have read many of his books simply for the intrigue they bestow onto me however , bag of bones breaks free of the typical king paradigm and soars to new heights
this book surprised me in that i enjoyed it so much i mean i have always loved king 's work but this one resolidified me as a fan and more proof that king knows exactly what he 's doing when he writes
a great portion of the book is very boring i really felt like rushing through the book i do n't recommend this book to other
and even if you know nothing about baseball like me , kearns goodwin has hit a home run with wait till next year you will learn all about the rivalry between the mets and the yankees and the history of goodwin 's beloved brooklyn dodgers she tells all about her heroes jackie robinson , gil hodges and roy campanella all of these great baseball nuggets are woven into her story of growing up in brooklyn in the '50s , and is so evocative of a time and place that was quintessentially american this book will make you long for a town like rockville centre , sometime between 1949 and 1957
i , too , grew up on long island in the 50s and early 60s \( two years in queens and ten years out on duh oyland \) i'm a few years younger the dodgers were already in hollywood and i rooted for the hated jankees but the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood , from soothing sound of red barber 's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of rockville centre , read periodically in lieu of a sunday sermon , mostly asking for more money
doris kearns goodwin seems to have written a book about her growing up in the ny suburbs for her own pleasure of simply remembering the simpler days before free agency , adulthood and the pressures that come to all of us as we move along in years her storytelling is at times pure magic , when it was the dodgers of brooklyn , the yankees of the bronx and the giants of manhattan and the polo grounds the hope of a baseball fan shows beautifully and reminds us all that we need n't lose all of our childish passion simply because the years pass one is reminded of the past couple of years with the red sox ending the curse and the white sox winning in style in the south side of chicago it leaves cubs nation truly understanding this concept next year
just re read this book wonderful story about growing up in the sweetness of the 1950 's , but also about overcoming childhood loss , to become a very successful person author , wife and mother
doris kearns goodwin took a break from national history to get personal in this 1997 memoir of her experiences growing up a long island girl in the 1940s and 1950s rooting for the hard luck brooklyn dodgers like bob and ray used to say , her loss is your gain
i love doris kearns goodwin 's work , and this book is no exception it 's very different from her other books , but very enjoyable it brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers
it 's been a while for me since i read this one , but one impression clearly stuck , happy bright childhood in the 1950 's and , yes , baseball
in 1949 , when doris kearns was six and living in rockville center , ny , her father taught her how to chart and score a baseball game , the primary \( radio \) entertainment of her community in these years , it was baseball that unified the local community , though whether one was loyal to the brooklyn dodgers , as kearns was , the ny yankees , or the ny giants was a different matter for kearns goodwin , the youngest in the family , it was baseball which served as her ritual connection to her father , since she sat with him after dinner each night and related the scoring of that day 's game
i finished reading , wait till next year , last evening and i would like anyone who enjoys memoirs or simply appreciates beautiful writing , to run out and grab ms goodwin 's charming book a recollection of the life she led in long island n y and the journey she made with the brooklyn dodgers it is not just about baseball , it 's about growing up in the late forties and fifties , about family life , a coming of age story for doris and dem bums this past summer was the 50th anniversery of the dodgers first world championship in 1955 and it seemed an appropriate time to read ms goodwin 's memoir and i'm so very happy i did
i 've re read this book several times now lani diane rich is a master of romantic comedy and the offbeat heroine for those of us who are tired of reading ultra perfect female heroines , wanda 's a breath of fresh air , slightly tinged with the scent of scotch it 's hard for me to believe that other reviewers here never let go with a four letter word when things are n't going well , and the author 's willingness to go there with her character gives wanda the feel of the real
or any book written in the first person , but i did enjoy this book the heroine was flawed , which i liked , but the hero was a saint , which i did n't quite believe oh , do n't get me wrong , walter is a man any woman would want , but the big question is why did he want wanda \? even so , i thought the book was better than average
i ca n't believe people are actually raving about this book i was so offended by the inappropriate language that i could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story the main character is acting like she is 3 , rather than 32 this is hardly destined to be a classic and i would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste
i met this author at the romance writers of american national conference in reno , where i learned she had been nominated for a rita \( think oscars for women 's fiction \) for best first book she was such a delight that i had already decided to buy the book even before she won the award i was certainly not disappointed i like characters with a lot of hubris , and i especially enjoy female protagonists who do not require a prince charming to fix their lives even if they meet him fun secondary characters \( bones is great ! \) , too terrific read i highly recommend this book
a friend referred me to this new author , and i truly owe her one lani diane rich made me laugh and cry , and also kept me entertained for the entire story at a time in my life when reading something grown up is a luxury at best , this book provided a wonderful escape i ca n't wait to get the next two books , and hope she continues writing for all of us that are now hooked on her characters thanks for a great read
good golly this is a terrible book ! i endured the first 100 pages hoping it would get better and when it did n't , i skimmed to the end the plot is vapid , the writing is choppy and awkward , and i could guess the outcome by page 15 rich plows through the story , not really explaining or developing anything , seemingly writing down the first idea that pops into her head her lame attempts at humor are just that lame there is no character development or realism here this is a book where total strangers become best friends in a five minute phone call , loving parents disown their daughter because she is trapped in an abusive relationship , a 32 year old names all her bottles of scotch albert , and terms like hoo wah and bo doob oom chaa are meant to convey that a character is falling in love
lani diane rich made a booming debut with time off for good behavior i originally read the book when it first came out and recently re read the novel it was even better the second time around
this was a really entertaining story my only complaint is that i was able to finish it in a few hours
hard to resist impossible to put down it was terrific from the get go i found wanda to be a very likeable character and no more litigious than the next person who was blown up in a gas leak and left in a coma from the cross examination of a pencil faced lawyer i was rooting for her
one must read this book this book is a great experience of every reader who can go throughly
this book is a parody , a satire written by a very knowlegebale author
vladmir girshkin is an unlikeable schemer who spends most of the story fleeing those whom he has defrauded or angered he deals with a series of bizarre girlfriends and an even less likeable mother eventually moving from new york to the fictional ex soviet satellite republic of stolavia , vladmir ascends to a non violent but powerful role within russian organized crime the detailed side characters range from charmingly offbeat to intensely annoying shteyngart hilariously mocks the vapid trendiness and vain sophistry of overeducated , underworked american postgraduates in europe he also explores issues of national and personal identity as vladmir moves back and forth from america to europe i'm definitely interested in reading more from this author
the characterization of vladimir girshkin is excellent , from how he looks and dresses \( which morphs through the book \) , to how he thinks about himself , his family , his ethniticity , to how he perceives the other russians and americans around him many humoristic moments as vladimir , in an effort to get himself out of a dead end life , gets in with deeper and crazier schemes to extract money and respect from different criminal elements , all the while building \( or rebuilding \? \) the ego inside the man the characterization , as a trip of self discovery , is very well written
this was an excellent book that defies description it 's unpredictable , constantly changing focus and rhythym it 's funny , and observant , and really feels like an insightful work of fiction
the title of this book is a misnomer there 's no russian debutante in the book unless you count 25 year old vladimir girshkin , who came to the u s from leningrad as a young boy
i came across this book when advising a friend 's college age child who was researching careers and was using this book
i am saddened by the utterly unfair and inappropriate posting here by one reader she had not read the book , but because i am a mere moderate feminist rather than a radical one , she chooses to excoriate me here a far more unbiased source , usa today 's review of my book said , from finding the well suited job to customizing it , this book is full of smart advice in the reader 's choice poll , it was rated the 1 most useful career guide here on amazon , you can read sample material from the book i encourage you to do that before making your decision
sorry , i just cannot believe that the humorous and honest approaches recommended in this book will work it all seems very idealistic , flaky and undignified i value honesty \( and humor too ! \) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum i would find someone using these strategies very off putting the words sense of entitlement come to mind and i am not conservative so what would a conservative employer think
very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor in the first story he explains his job as an elf at santaland and describes his daily life it is so funny , some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time
if you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you he may push it sometimes but is n't that what a good writer should do \? knowing he is half greek , so am i , i was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard unfortunately there was n't one santaland was my favorite
i generally like david sedaris in fact he 's one of my favorites but when his stories veer off into the death of children , almost gratuitously , i ca n't see the humor this is , please note , the first book of his that i have n't enjoyed but it 's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me
david sedaris was only famous for talking about christmas santaland diaries , heard on npr stations across the country , is what gave him his first fame this collection of stories came after his first book , barrel fever , and before the rest this is back when he was still writing short stories , which he is n't really known for anymore this book has a couple of short stories and , like the short stories in barrel fever , they 're not really accessible to a wider audience they 're dark baby murder dark definitely not something everyone can appreciate but pick it up , maybe you 'll like it if you 're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children 's holiday pageants bitterly , it 's worth a try
perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug , are n't i hilarious \? tone of this book note it is entirely possible that i am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book or even to identify the humor in the book
if you are looking for the literary equivalent of it 's a wonderful life this book is definitely not for you however , if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays , you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by david sedaris from jim timothy , the extortionist who preys upon a pentecostal church , to dinah , the christmas sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh even though you know clarence the angel would disapprove if you 've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats , curl up with this offering and you 'll find a kindred spirit in david sedaris
i was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if i was ok i was uncontrollably laughing even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure , it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds i was embarrassing myself again
david sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive all of his books make me laugh out loud embarrass myself in public places , when i bring his books along this one did not disappoint either funny holidays tales that make the season brighter , or even out of season give you a healthy hearty laugh
truly the author 's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas , parents , children , evangelical christians from kentucky , television , macy 's , the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war , and keeping up with the joneses
the great dallas theological seminary professor dr hendricks shares with others his basic principles for passing on to his students the knowledge and passion for god 's word basically the book can be boiled down to one primary principle you must have passion for what you know to transfer what you know to others the book was originally released as the seven laws of the teacher , but has since been repackaged and re released under this new title with a new cover and design but the truths shared by hendricks are timeless and powerful and should be read by every teacher !
this is the best book on teaching out there every teacher must read this book , and not just once , but every year it is very practical and easy to read dr hendricks defines teaching as causing people to learn \( 87 \) the teacher is not somebody who covers material but enables students to change thus , the definition of learning is change this book is highly recomended
this is an easy read and great instruction manual i 've only read the first 2 chapters and i'm excited about reading the rest i hope to become a teacher who chages lives
communication and caring compassion is the key to teaching hendricks uses the acronym , teacher , to relate his concepts the examples of teacher student interaction shared in his book illustrate the importance of communication and show of care that motivates students to learn he states , the greatest teachers are not necessarily the people up front with high visibility they are the people who have great heart they communicate as a total person , and they communicate to the total person of their hearers \( 87 \) another way to be a person of impact , is to be vulnerable with one 's students not only are communication and compassion important , but preparation hendricks relates , teaching involves a delicate balance between facts and form , between content and communication , between what you teach and how you teach it \( 77 \) if teachers want to prepare their students to think , learn , and work , then four skills need to be taught reading , writing , listening , and speaking \( 48 \) though this book is written for sunday school teachers , it contains helpful suggestions for use in other teaching venues for instance , hendricks suggests a self examination in which teachers ask three questions what are my strengths what are my weaknesses , and what do i have to change \? \( 35 \) great teachers are the ones who continue to grow in their own personal learning hendricks' book is a good reminder for all teachers of the main purpose for bible teaching even if the teacher teaches in a secular institution , the basic principles of the book can be utilized for instance , students will be more willing to try harder and put more effort into their school work if they know the teacher truly cares for them
this book is an excellent resource for church education staff this book covers some basic principles \( or laws as he calls them \) regarding teaching in the church environment the law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch , as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment this is so true and often followed in higher education , but perhaps not very well followed in church education the sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning but according to henricks a student must study , must come to class on time , and must be interested in the material to proactively learn
when it comes to impact howard hendricks is a master teacher following these proven principles helped my college classes become full these principles work in formal classes , at any level , and in informal instruction parents will become more effective in their parenting this is a small , easily read book that will produce big dividends

mr dow 36 , 000 wants you to believe him this time no , really , he means it right in 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust i think that 's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust this guy is amazing
this is the best book written by stephen king ! i 've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before i die
i'm reviewing this as an afterthought of its genre the stand is , without question the best and the story is , in my opinion , the greatest stephen king has done i 've read the other reviews and i wo n't go into specifics , however , if you enjoy reading end of it all types of stories you will love this book another reviewer complained about it being lengthy well , you do n't have to read it to realize that but the story and characters are original and well developed the plot progresses smoothly to an exciting climax with lots of incredible things happening throughout and i 've read it three times
stephen king is a master of suspense , but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece '
well i got screamed at by my mom for reading this book she found out it was longer than the bible and got really fired up saying i shouldve read the bible anyhow , the plot is simple a doomsday plague is released killing near everyone everyone left either gave visions from this old chick or a weirdo its like the ultimate showdown between evil and good well thats what you are led to belive in 1800 plus pages of agonizingly meticulous details then the end comes and it really sucks i personaly think he had a deadline to meet or something and cut the book short its hard to put down but its got its faults
before reading 'the stand' i 'd only read a few novellas and the full length novel 'gerald's game' by stephen king and was not all that impressed however , after seeing the movie 'the stand' a few years ago and loving it , i decided to read the book that has been proclaimed by readers to be one of his best , and now i see why mr king has so many devotees
seriously , king 's always an incredible crafstman , his characters to die for , but of all of his novels \( i 've read most \) this stands out as his classic great later novels just feel different , even if the voice and writing is always spectacular the stand is less polished , but more engaging on a number of fronts vivid , memorable scenes i still remember fran biting her tongue on the beach , of all things characters are always real and that 's amazing in a fantasy epic normally , i look to escapism and fun in fantasy , but here , the characters feel so alive and real my one thumbs down and it 's not enough to bring this down to four stars is the expanded edition was not necessary the original was expanded enough and just right the new opening does n't engage me like the old one with stu in the garage , which is a real holy crap sort of opening i once read where king griped about his fans saying his best book was such an old classic but , hey , classic is classic this is a triumph the only weak point , to me , was the ending it felt rushed maybe not as vivid as the rest but it was all good , anyway i recommend this to anyone who is n't susceptible to nightmares \( it 's more disturbing than scary , mind you
this is the first ds book that i have read in about 20 years it made me realize why did i try again \? \? \? \? \? \? \?
this is one of danielle steel 's best books it is about cooper winslow , a fading movie actor and lady 's man who is in financial trouble she develops the character of coop well so it is easy to visualize him
i had not read danielle steel in several years i found the cottage to be shallow , implausible , and completely predictable i was very disappointed with this work
danielle steele is a master artist at slowly piecing a book together , such as one of her better novels , the cottage this book consists of amazing characters that are split from the lives they once knew , and later are puzzled back together for a friendly meeting each main character , jimmy , mark , and coop , are so different in their personalities but yet so much alike in their experiences they cry , laugh , and just simply have fun when they are finally together these three men share many similar situations throughout the novel and in the end , they all meet and talk about those certain happenings in each of their lives how woman have left , cheated , and even passed away but they dealt with it and moved on luckily , they all found each other in their differences and similarities to be best friends the capturing way steele writes activates your emotions and slams your reality way of thinking she has a happily ever after touch to her writing and it takes your breathe away i thoroughly enjoyed reading this selection and would reccomend it to anyone ! danielle steele is truly a romantic genius
this book has been helpful from the first day it arrived as a first time mom , i 've found that it answers a lot of the questions i had and some i did n't even think to ask ! much better than calling and bugging my busy doctor every other day
i purchased this book for my daughter and daugher in law for their first babies born this year and they have found it so useful and regularly refer to it not only is it great for new mothers but as things have changed so much since my children were born grandma has used it a lot as well i first purchased what to expect when you 're expecting by the same author and likewise it is a great book with lots of info
the new mother tells me this book is great , a real handy reference i gave it on the recommendation of another new mom who said she wondered how she could have survived her first baby 's first year without it it 's a great shower gift take it from the new mommies
i read this book after reading what to expect when you 're expecting and was very disappointed i liked expecting , most likely because while pregnancies differ , the biology is pretty much the same for everyone , so it 's hard to miswrite pregnancy however , after reading first year i have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child 's behavior or abilities i know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different , but i'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk i'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that i want my son to help clean up if i hand him a paper towel additionally , the book does not always offer a good answer to a question the answer usually comes in the form of some babies will , some babies wo n't how is that helpful \? ! ! after noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false , i finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy in long , i do not recommend this book to anyone , particularly a first time mother
this is a sweet book that is very reassuring
this book is a must for any new parents ! i have given this as a gift to every one of my pregnant friends and family
an invaluable resource starting with what to expect when your expecting through the what to expect the toddler years parent 's should own them all as a first time mom , i consult this book at least once a day
having had to wait 10 years because of infertility , i was so ready for children when jordan came into our lives , i had so many questions only this book could answer i got to know the milestones a baby should come across , the things we as parents are to expect and the missing details that a pediatrician ca n't have time to dwell on because of the busy schedule he she keeps have you ever experienced that \? how many of us enjoy a visit to the pediatrician that spans 30 40 minutes \? not many so this book helped when our second child arrived miraculously \( we were told that we could not have anymore \) , this book helped us once again to determine that because of missing milestones , we had to be concerned about our baby 's mental and physical health i highly recommend this book to new moms because if you ca n't remember to ask your doctor every question you had , ask the book read , read , read it was our baby bible and by the way , our first book has been passed around so many times it has gone to another state in the usa , hongkong , china and singapore and i just bought another one for a colleague
this book provides a lot of great information for taking care of a new baby a great counterpart to what to expect when you 're expecting
i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature some of the pages were blank , having not even been printed i figure the book was a total loss of money spent
sticking to the diet in the book i lost 35 lbs in five months i find , interesting the fact that i can eat as much , or even more that i need as long as i keep the named proteins and carbs separate this is the second copy of the book i have purchased and did so for my son and his family he needs to lose about 20 pounds i suggested that he follow the book suggestions very strickly and he should attain his goal
i am about to get married in a year , and as usual , i am looking for any way i can to slim down for that perfect wedding dress just a few days ago , i was sluggish , and depressed after going on jenny craig and failing at it i went on jenny craig at age 16 and was uncannily successful , almost 10 years later , i decided to try it again , but to no avail it just did n't fit my life style anymore , and i had a really hard time refraining from cheating , and incorporating resturaunt and non menu meals to fit my plan
when buying a book of this type , buy it for the value of the information instead of the person who wrote it suzanne shares a method that worked for her , and she does it in a helpful , light hearted , and humorous manner even if you do n't believe in food combining , the approach and the recipes are still quite helpful if you 're serious about losing weight and have tired everything else on the market your success with this program will be 100 up to you and your determination to achieve your goals i think it 's worth buying
i lost 20lbs in 2 weeks this weekend i had custard \( made with heavy cream \) she is awesome in 2 more weeks i 'll be under 300lbs i love you , suzanne
i 've been reading about weight management programs for the past 4 years i love reading about the human body and better ways to fuel it so , i signed up for what i thought to be the best plan on the market , weight watchers they have that new whole foods plan as someone who eats salads everyday for lunch , i thought the plan was tough ! i could n't stick with it i constantly had food cravings i gave up after 3 weeks and never used the rest of my meeting tickets what to do next
the problem with biographies of marlon brando , and celebrities in general , is that they are often written by an outsider , someone who had little or no personal acquaintance with the subject and is sometimes just out to cash in on their celebrity it is these problems with most biographies that makes george englund 's biography of marlon brando such a joy to read
george englund 's memoir of marlon brando is that , a memoir and far from a full scale biography it is a touching remembrance , filled with genuine affection for its subject , but not so much as to make the author blind to the shortcomings and warts of the greatest of all our film actors in its affection it is a welcome departure from some of the more vicious tabloid like portrayals of brando peter manso 's biography comes to mind at its best englund 's work is distinguished by some really beautiful interludes and gripping passages his description of visiting his own absentee father after decades is especially moving one senses that englund believed he was privy to the whole of brando , the insider of all insiders his graphic description of brando 's last night is almost an exercise in trying to prove to himself , and us , how close he was to brando and it is a rare occurrence of englund going perhaps too far but for all that he was allowed to see , it is also apparent to the reader , if not to englund himself , that georgie was kept at arms length from various facets and compartments of his famous subject there are dramatic and notable gaps in the book , and one gets the feeling that englund 's import as a macho and intellectual sidekick grew once wally cox died it is perhaps too much to ask any single book to cover the whole of brando the subject is simply too complex but this is a useful glimpse inside at least some aspects of brando 's life
good book , but i have one major reservation
this is a sad and poignant memoir and a fine companion piece to brando 's autobiography i wondered while reading it why mr englund was n't mentioned by name in the autobiography , but that is made clear toward the end of mr englund 's work a few comments regarding the handful of negative reviews on this site brando 's legacy as a great actor is not diminished in any way by some of the brutal revelations regarding his personal life perhaps a few sordid details could have been left out but i never got the sense that they were thrown in out of a sense of animus directed at brando in fact what comes through repeatedly is the author 's deep affection for his subject , a mutual bond that was forged through their shared misfortune at having self absorbed and destructive fathers to their credit they achieved great material and artistic success in spite of the psychological burdens they both stuggled with throughout their lives
marlon brando once said that his friends do n't write books about him so what does that make englund \? marlon said about carlo fiore , a once questionable so called friend , that he probably wrote his book about marlon because that 's all he had left the same seems to apply to englund i mean , why describe the gory details of marlon 's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon \? seriously , would a real 'friend' have done such a thing \? why not leave us with some glorious memory of marlon as a true friend would i mean , without the help of englund 's book , marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes , inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the brando legend \? if marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma \( why we love him \) , and i believe he did it on purpose , what gives this so called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend \? he 's a sell out jerk to me , but that 's just my opinion would alice marchak \( marlon 's assistant \) or jocelyn \( marlon 's sister \) ever write a book about marlon \? i do n't think so and they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something , anything about marlon they did n't because people who truly love you do n't do that englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever , but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life , but not at all in death that is the lowest of all the slimballs because marlon probably died thinking this sell out was his friend not ! ! !
a real downer i realize marlon brando 's life had many sadnesses , but this book really seemed to dwell on them mr englund told of how he thought i wanted to hear how mr brando thought
i believe that mr englund has set a new standard on how biographies should be written he showed us a side of marlon that should be included in every biography , and so rarely is i also applaud mr englund 's passion as a true friend in this wonderful book , he has shown what a real friend is , which is something that most of us can only aspire to
george englund 's book is the product of 50 years of a friendship with marlon brando , the lives of two men and their families intertwined , loving and suffering through the best and worst times his book portrays the pain and grief of loss , the exultation of success , and the double edge of fame and reality george 's book goes beyond the commonplace biography , and digs down deep i recommend reading it
this book comes straight from the heart as 3rd son of author george englund , i , george englund jr am closer my dad than anyone else i grew up with marlon and his children christian , miko , and cheyenne i spent time with them all in tahiti on his atoll and worked with marlon on several projects directly and extensively
ark angel is my first go at an alex rider novel even without reading the five preceding books , i enjoyed this one for what it is a spy novel for young adults horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up there is virtually no character development or exploration there are constant plot twists and turns whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader if the reader is looking for a character to identify with , to journey with , to aspire to , alex is a bit thin if the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down , this could be a good vein to mine
some of the other alex rider books may have been a little predictable , but ark angel is by far the worst book in the series as if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head is n't bad enough , this book really jumps the shark , not only does anthony horowitz yet again use the corrupt rich guy plot \( this may have something to do with his childhood \) , but at the end of the book alex gets launched into space save your 15 and buy maximum ride by james patterson or a scott westerfeld book instead
other than stormbreaker , this may be the next best alex rider adventure yet in some ways the plot is predictable as all alex rider stories are except for the ending surprise in scorpia the action is fast paced and is perfect for a teenage boy reader girls who enjoy spy stories will like it too it is hard to put the book down
this is the same classic alex rider adventure one of the better ones in the series but scorpia is still the best
alex rider is by far the thriftiest boy i know ! horowitz is a great writer and can make the best descriptions ! i enjoy reading his books very much
in this thrilling addition to the alex rider series , alex is in the hospital , recovering from a near shave with a sniper bullet , courtesy of scorpia while in the hospital , he befriends the friendless paul drevin , the son of a multi millionaire one night , as alex was walking down the hallway , he saw the receptionist shot , and heard that the shooters were after paul alex tricks the kidnappers into thinking he 's paul , and then leads them through the hotel , zapping one of them in the neck with defibullators , knocks another one out with a medicine ball , and tricks a man with a solid metal watch into walking into a room with an incredibly powerful magnet that was n't pretty but he fergot about the fourth guy he 's captured and brought back to the headquarters of the kidnappers , who are actually the members of a terrorist oraganization , force three and so it goes , with a brilliant escape from a burning building , a awsome go kart race , a meeting with the cia , a private island , a huge space hotel , rigged to come hurtliing down to our very own washinton d c
i have read all the books of this series this is really good i mean i didnt like the ending much but besides that anthony horowitz is a great author
i assigned this text almost unseen as a course book because it included so many of the classic essays which one might have ended up xeroxing the students found the book very useful i would have liked a more historical focus but that 's because of my own training i will assign the book again
through this book charles m province has complied the very best there is in leadership read and learn this collection of george s patton 's pithy one liners shows how business managers can successed by applying the combat tested principles of one of america 's most famous battlefield leaders general patton was a professional soldier who spent his life inspiring people to accomplish the seemingly impossible a brief bio amp photos of the general help readers visualize one of the great military leaders of all time the inspirational content will make this book an indispensable companion for busy executives everywhere
this book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie patton based on ladislas' book it contains typos such as 'd day' and also does not give any insight into the man connecting patton to deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two men

in lost chicago , historian david lowe explores the architectural and cultural history of america 's great heartland city this is a community who architectural heritage was all to often squandered during the last five decades of its growth and evolution lowe 's elegant , and informative text is wonderfully enhanced with more than 270 rare , period photos and prints \( many of them published here for the first time \) lost chicago is a celebration of the age of gustavus swift and philip d armour and the greatest stockyards in the world when cyrus mccormick , potter palmer , george pullman , and marshall field were the national barons of business and industry when prairie avenue and state streets rivaled new york 's fifth avenue when architectural giants ranging from louis sullivan to frank lloyd wright were designing buildings of incomparable excellence and innovation lost chicago is a must for students of chicago history , architecture , and personalities
first issued in 1975 , this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of chicago 's architecture that has been destroyed \( by nature and man \) today chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel \( and it is , i live there ! \) but after reading this book you wo n't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the urban renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened if you are interested in architecture , chicago history or urban design and planning , read this book
i had a little difficulty getting this book , but i'm glad that i did finally find it it is a wonderful mystery , even though the subject behind the mystery is disturbing i know that i knew about research done on live animals , but i never thought about with dogs somehow i pictured lab rats and mice it goes against everything that i believe in to use our domestic best friends for product testing and experiments but the mystery was good , and i enjoyed holly and her friends again ms conant knows how to write a story while she bravely uncovers some less than desirable facts about big business this is a wonderful series for dog lovers , or for any animal lovers if it comes to that
holly winter returns in the 2nd book in the dog lover 's mysteries holly writes articles for a dog 's life , trains at the local obedience club , shows her dog in obedience , and works to find the dognappers of her dog and her father 's wolf her malamute , rowdy , plays a starring role in this book that takes a strong look at testing on animals
ms conant constantly amazes me with her ability to weave dog info into mystery anyone who has ever shown a dog had had to deal with a gossipy trainer handler owner and few would n't like to take a pair of shears to one of them as well ! i adore this book and highly suggest you get a copy
to read sir charles is to read about life without the pompous filter you get with most other pap this installment is no different from anything else from lord chinaski
with bukowski there is no middle ground you either love him or you hate him yes he can be filthy , jaded and downright mean but there is the ring of truth here as well published posthumously this is a feast for bukowski fans there are a lot of dark poems here like walking with the dead and return to sender but there is also some lighthearted stuff in the fool dines out he shows us his human side he is the husband whose rude behavior towards a waiter brings on spousal criticism \( in private of course \)
bukowski in his last years rare to see a writer grapple with aging and death in such a matter of fact way there are some true gems in this one bone palace is a little repetitive , but you ca n't be shocked to find bukowski holding forth on booze , women , horses , hypocrites , and writing what else did he ever write about \? and really , what more can you ask for
this book is only a shadow of what bukowski can do i was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work these poems are all ones that he would have never released had he been alive they have no charm and show nothing of his talent his wife i guess thought they were good enough to be released i beg to differ if you want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check out betting on the muse which is an amazing book
all about grilling , is a refreshing book of new ideas for outdoor cooking and entertaining i was very impressed with the different combinations of ingredients , the presentation of the meal , the grilled side dishes , and the rubs and sauces i received the book as a gift and have enjoyed using it for my summer entertaining i am now purchasing a book for a friend
catch me if you can follows the life of frank w abignale one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was this book is the autobiographical account of abignale 's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father 's mobil credit card there are so many times in this book that i had to step back and think about the air of confidence that abignale displayed , yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him
this book was very well written and so much fun to read
we all know of frank abagnale 's personality arrogant , yet kind with class among all the different characters that he chooses to play , whether he 's a pilot , doctor , lawyer , or a college professor , i believe that frank is somewhat confused of who he is frank ran away from home at 16 the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school at 16 , most people do n't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future one thing was for sure frank wanted money and women
frank abagnale jr stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time the story is inflated at times \( in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner , a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with \) still , the catch me if you can is engaging , and abignale 's scams combine inventiveness and good humor enjoy
if you , like me , have seen the film with leonardo dicaprio and tom hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book , you are reading the right review ! if you were in front of me , i would look at you with a grin \( as if to show that i knew something you did n't \) and encourage you to do so
i read this book after watching the movie \( staring tom hanks and leonardo dicaprio \) before i started i knew i liked the story , but i did n't realize how much i loved reading abagnale 's account of his life of crime i enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot , a doctor , a professor , and a lawyer i also liked the novel 's open frankness about the author 's misdeeds
many people became aware of frank abagnale jr 's story until the movie starring tom hanks and leonardo dicapprio was released \( even though an earlier movie based on this story was released \)
not a reader of fiction , fantasy , sci fi therefore picked up a copy of catch me if you can from a bookstore yesterday
ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture
this book helped me focus my mind on my weight loss i lost 65 lbs and have kept it off for a year now i am buying multiple copies for my friends and relatives ! the psychology of permanent weight loss is the most important thing , and this book really helped me change my way of thinking about food and exercise
once upon a time martians and venusians met , fell in love , and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences then they came to earth and amnesia set in they forgot they were from different planets based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals , men are from mars , women are from venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships now viewed as a modern classic , this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict does n't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow do n't be too surprised when you are reading this book and you recognize someone and some situation that is eerily like your own
if you are young , under 30 , this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex if you are older , this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned \( or things that you missed \) in the school of everyday life for both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others
this book has really good advice and insight that makes sense the only downside is that the references to martians and venusians gets annoying after awhile
very intuitive , well written , reader voice is a bit annoying but tolerable
f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what 's his name gives them and remember , this doctor , is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives , so why do you \? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life
this book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences for example men and women have different values men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent women need to express how they feel about their problems , while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring if everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better the book , however , is at times dry reading
there are varying differences between men and women and mr gray takes his time in this book to explain what they are what i got from it was a new perspective , a new way to understanding what needs to be understood how to interact with the opposite sex what 's most important is to take the time to actually listen without formualing what you 're going to say next i can see why this book is so popular now along with this one , i also recommend man magnet
once in a while a book speaks so strongly to so many people , that it does the impossible it is popular and worthwhile the best part is that this book gives simple pragmatic execrcises to change communication for the better get the book and stay married another great reading that i recommend is in the meantime by vanzan
this book has become so popular that terminology from this book has entered our popular culture \( calling a woman a venusian , for example \) but my opinion is that this is well earned and hopefully a plus for helping men and women understand one another
insane that anyone would ascribe to these ideas let alone actually trying to apply them i 've listened to the tapes , read the books , became more incensed as i went along yes , there are differences between the sexes , but this guy does n't come close to getting it right , and if you 're a man following his advice , then you can write off having a long term with an intelligent woman this fool creates escapes and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men , claiming that it 's innate to the male gender , and would suggest that their women forgive them for it !
the book chronicles tidy snapshots of the lives and careers of 4 different men whose influence in corporate regulation remains unrivaled i particularly enjoyed the chapter on brandeis it is terribly unfortunate to contemporary american society that a man like justice louis brandeis is not still alive and a sitting judge with the supremes brandeis 's intellect and legacy puts the 9 slugs currently sitting on the bench to shame
a young woman and her son are murdered and their home burned down the man who did it gets caught in the fire and ends up in the hospital the woman 's brother , joe lassiter , a professional investigator , begins to probe into why his sister and nephew were killed it all leads him to 17 other women and their young sons , all conceived at the same fertility clinic , who have been murdered in the exact same circumstances
this book is a great book , do n't get me wrong , but has a slow beginning , slow enough that i actually became discouraged and thought about putting the book away , but once the book really gets going it is thrilling and very fast paced if you can make it through the initial crawl and into the heart of the book you will not , at all , be disappointed for sticking with this novel the concept of this book is fairly simple something in the scientific world is being done that the church strongly disproves of , enough disproval that it drives them to kill the victims are all the same a mother and a male child under the age of 4 the victims that are targeted all have one thing in common , they all went to a clinic that was doing top of the end research and was very successful at allowing those that were infertile or too old the possibility to have children the clinic helps out those who want to carry children and are otherwise deemed untreatable , and also carrying out research that could alter the world forever , an extremely delicate subject that threatens to change the way our entire history , as human beings , is viewed through the whole debacle many lives are lost in hope of protecting something deemed sacred
has it been so long \? 1998 \? \? this is one of the first books that i reviewed on the internet i was asked to write it , and made me a john case fan this book deals with a fertiliy clinic that has amazing donors and the plans from the church to stop it the last page is a catch your breath ending a stranger in a local bookstore asked me if i 'd ever read john case he was happy i knew the book i was proud of that first review and still like to dabble in writing of course books like case 's make it easy
this book is one of the five best i have ever read it is very thourough and in our scientific world , who knows \? read this book
this book rests entirely on one idea , with which you are teased from the very beginning by the middle , it can be pretty much guessed , but you still have a long way to go before the last sentence finally confirms your worst suspicions
i just finished reading this book and wow ! it was great ! i really had trouble putting it down the plot was very convincing and i just loved the ending there was a surprise on every page including the last page as a writer , the two things i was most impressed with \( in addition to the wonderful plot \) was how case created such a sense of place i really felt like i was there in every scene and i could really visualize the space i also thought he did such a good job of nailing the dialogue each character sounded different , one could imagine someone speaking english as a second language , yet it was not difficult to read i thought the information about the relics in the catholic church was especially interesting and also , all the technical cloning stuff made me realize that this entire plot is not so far fetched it would make a great movie
i use to read grisham and patterson before they got irritating and case puts them to shame i loved this book , the idea was amazing cloning from well , i ca n't tell you because that will spoil it i would highly recommend this compared to eighth day which was not that great
the genesis code a thriller by john case , is a today 's thriller , it could have been written for today or tomorrow reads very much true to life people beware ! there is someone waiting around each and every corner
this calendar features some of alex ross 's best paintings and action figures , from january to december there is a year full of heros
the most gorgeous artwork in comic books contains the most extraordinary artwork of alex ross \( superman , batman , wonder woman , the justice league , etc , even hanna barbera ! \) a comics fan , i recieved this as a christmas gift , and i read it again and again
to call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the genius alex ross is not presented in chronological order , but rather starts with the most popular characters superman , batman , etc , and then moves on to other work such as justice league of america , kingdom come , alan moore , etc
dc comics fans who love comic art collections must have mythology the dc comics art of alex ross it 's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters ross' art brought to life over the decades , from superman and flash to green lantern included also is ross' new comic book series justice , new sketches , and an oversized coffee table format which helps display and profile , in full color , ross' entire line of dc comics superheroes an original superman and batman story written by graphic designer chip kidd , a re telling of robin 's origin written by paul dini , plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover mythology appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own
got it as a present for my boyfriend he loved it really nice cover that folds out
i could n't believe , but mr ross did it again ! even better ! the second edition of the hardcover edition is even better than the first one ! the cover is already a gem ! you have to see to believe it ! not to mention the extra amount of pages of new art and updated material ! go for it ! aaa
this is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book also , looks great on a coffee table
this book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend ! she loves it , and did n't put it down all day after receiving it
more an inside in ross' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters beautiful boo
this book will astonish you even before you open it the jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of dc , superman and batman , and below the jacket you 'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every dc superhero battling versus their respective villains
to my mind , this is the best of michael lewis 's work his style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark , and his writing is at top form next examines the changes wrought by the internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential , mainly in the form of vignettes there is no beginning , middle or end , so if you 're looking for a story with a plot line , this is likely not going to appeal to you the lack of story line is , however , what i found compelling the theme of the book is , there 's this 1800 pound bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding , and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides this is pretty much quintessential michael lewis he finds an individual , or an event , or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift \( a deliberate choice of words here , since moneyball dealt with the emergence of sabrmetrics , whose acolytes all seem to have read the structure of scientific revolutions \)
not a profound book lots of story telling to make a few good points a fast and fun read
michael lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud i think i learned more about wall street from liar 's poker than all the great serious tomes i 've read , while at the same time enjoying it as pure farce , and yet i was left with an increased respect for the people and institutions how is that even possible \?
next the future just happened is about how the internet is changing the world lewis profiles jonathan lebed , a teenage stock market wizard \( the sec says he was a stock market manipulator lewis is n't so sure \) a teenage law expert who has never studied law a teenager in england who is using gnutella software as a springboard to , i do n't know , take over the world , i guess
as a lecturer of e commerce , i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however , i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted
i 've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet , but found this one a notch above the rest whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects , this one went a lot deeper and touched on the meta changes underlying society but far from being a grand , generalist thesis , lewis grounds his observations in real flesh and blood stories that are highly readable his experience as a professional writer shines through on every page
without beating about the bush , let me state that this is one of the best non fiction books i have read on the effects of the internet on our society
the author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet related happenings his intent seems to be to say
it 's an engaging first hand account from an anthropologist who went to live with an inuit family she gives a very candid account of her own difficulties in adapting to their culture
spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters just when you think grisham ca n't do it again , he does it anyway
i read legal thrillers to escape i love them but with a bit of guilty pleasure as one consuming junk food for the mind not this one though this book combines the thrill of escapist reading with a wholesome and affirming message that feeds the heart and mind
grisham delivers again with this great story about the dead billionaire 's strange last will , and the redemption of the broken lawyer who sees the light this has a spiritual message that is subtle , sincere , and uplifting , yet not beaten over your head you 'll walk away understanding how money can be a curse , and if you do n't believe that , give this book a try
i do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as i started it john grisham describes places and people like very few can do if you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else i find something better to do loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read
with every grisham book i read , i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense , but to insert other elements to make this human as well
the filthy rich are interesting missionaries are interesting the jungles of brazil are interesting lawyers are interesting ok , lawyers are n't interesting but grisham sure makes them seem interesting and his book does a great job of tying together a wealthy , spoiled family to a single woman living in brazil working as a missionary
john grisham has done it again i had read this book originally a year after release and i just finished my second read and though it all started to come back to me as i read it it was still an exciting page turner as it was the first time that says a lot about this book
once again it is another good read by grisham it is hard to think what my will would be like if i get over a million dollars i cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle

it 's been a while since i 've read one of janet evanovich 's stephanie plum novels , but a sudden need for light reading found ten big ones at the book store plum 's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after joe morelli or ranger , how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station , and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed definitely light fare , even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic he not only wants stephanie dead , but he also wants her end to be spectacular
i picked up the first stephanie plum novel out of curiousity and was n't disappointed i 've gone on to read every book in the series and have enjoyed every one rarely does a book have me laughing out loud , but i do with each one of these
when i first discovered the stephanie plum series \( i started with four to score , then backtracked \) , i was delighted with the character of stephanie plum although she was down on her luck , she was plucky , endearing , and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered in earlier books , stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy , held her own in her on again off again relationship with boyfriend cop joe morelli , and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with ranger she even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin vinnie , her ex husband , and her nemesis joyce barnhardt but now , stephanie plum has morphed into someone who is selfish , stubborn and just plain stupid she has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself
like many of the readers , i agree that ms evanovich seems to have run out of ideas the series could be written by a twelve year old just give them a checklist blow up car , eat donuts , feed rex a donut grape piece of pizza , eat donuts , vascilate between ranger and joe , eat six tastykakes you get the idea ms evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book , though she added in ranger 's shower gel to the list it was only mentioned every other paragraph might i add that i have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does seriously , the books went downhill after the sixth installment if ms evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over , perhaps she should consider ending the series
bounty hunter stephanie plum and her co worker lula are off to buy nachos , but in the meantime witness a robbery from the red devil no one was hurt , but yet another one of stephanie 's cars gets destroyed
if you 've been following the stephanie plum series , you 'll probably be pleased to know that the principal characters have n't changed a bit
this is my routine for beginning a stephanie plum novel i grab a few peanut butter oreos and a glass of milk and curl up on the couch in my comfy pants i open the book and read the first paragraph the way i see it , life is a jelly doughnut you do n't really know what it 's about until you bite into it and then , just when you decide it 's good , you drop a big glob of jelly on your best t shirt and that 's when i burrow just a little deeper into the couch cushions , confident that janet evanovich has written another laugh out loud winner i wo n't be able to put down
some writers are trashing this 10th offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her so what ! i laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute have fun , buy it enjoy
after reading this series in order , and just finishing ten big ones , i still have n't figured out what the titles have to do with the books other than that confusion , i continue to be delighted with the characters and the plots
a very thorough analysis of the contemporary trends in western europe from an american writer who lives there bawer starts with an indepth description of the european social structure and the state of mind of the europeans since ww2 , that exposed them to the risk of being taken over by an intolerant but dedicated idealogy he concludes that western europe , as we know and cherish , is moving towards its own destruction through a takeover by the wave of muslim immigration he points the main reasons in the tolerance for the intolerant , by the multiculturalism that is dominating the dogmatic thinking of the european elites and by the pasivity of the europeans who lost their respect for their own values and culture bawer backs his thesis by both statistical facts , quotes from local articles , lectures and report , as well as testimonies from private conversations he had with native europeans
this is an excellent and insightful book that should be required reading in high schools i have never been to europe and must say that after reading while europe slept i have zero desire to go for years i have ranted about the scourge of political correctness to my friends and family and refuse to partake in it this book is a great illustration of how destruction pc is i wonder if europe will wake up before it 's too late \?
in his book bruce bawer outlines the negative impact of immigration policies in western europe essentially bawer points out that instead of encouraging integration , western europe focuses on multiculturalism multiculturalism is the idea that new cultures maintain a separate identity , even though immigrants have taken up residence in a new nation \( ideally multiculturalism is acceptance of all cultures but that is rarely seen in reality \)
this poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each european country , then describe the experiences of each country with its islamic radicals \( and their families \) instead , there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative the poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the european countries can improve the situation in the future
this book really serves to answer some questions i had about the current state of the world in general europe vs islam , us vs eurpoe , islam vs the world amazing some good details , but the first hand accounts of the problems in europe are more propelling , imho could n't put it down
i finished this book very quickly and found it to be both very illuminating on the muslim immigrant experience and the foibles of the native born europeans who , raised on socialism and convinced of their sophistication , have lost the ability to comprehend much less deal with a violent ideology that wants to destroy their 'utopia'
while europe slept is one of those books that is a must read for every american today the author is so knowledgable about the europeans and their view of america that he dispels the notion that americans are the bad guys sure we have our faults but not in comparison to western europe thinking bawer points out that the elite run europe without any concern for the common man
i can understand why the secular left does not the christians here in the usa , but what i do n't understand is how they seem completely oblivious to what their fate would be if osama and those like him win this war we are in the radical left needs to read this book someone get a copy to rosie odonnell and michael moore
bruce bawer 's book is informative and covers quite a lot of ground in its description of the insidious nature of radical islam in europe and how the political elite are more enamoured with political power over a propagandised electorate instead of applying themselves to the defence of freedom but that is what european style government is all about despite the contemporary terrorism of radical islam , and is like democracy the antithesis of freedom
best of its ilk , the rainmaker surpasses most legal thrillers without a doubt a quick read start to finish a great novel this book as defiantly started me on grisham saga , that wo n't end until i 've read all his books i highly recommend this to any one who has any remote interest in the law , or just reading in general a
i was a little reluctant to read this one , mainly because i was so bored by grisham 's the client and because i heard this was a funny book usually funny means excessively silly and cute
this book is a good read fun story and the characters are very likeable

it was true to the movie , which was wonderful i highly reccommend the book and amazon offered it at a much lower price than barnes and noble
i love this storyline baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be , and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard
this novel is an underdog story of a young lawyer , rudy baylor , barely out of law school who goes against the big guns that of a very corrupt insurance company defended by lawyers from a big , prestigious law firm you cannot help but root for rudy , who put himself through college and law school and who is so desperate for a job in law that his job hunting leads to a very low point he finds work from a corrupt lawyer however , through circumstances beyond his control , rudy soon finds himself with his own struggling practice with a paralawyer \( grisham invention \) named deck deck is an unattractive , unethical guy who does what it takes to get the job done he is an amusing character and rings true to life i think that most people know someone like him , or know of someone like him nonetheless , in the end , i feel sorry for how things turned out for him
rudy baylor is a law student in his last year of law school as one of his projects , he is required to offer free legal advice to senior citizens at the local nursing home little did he realize that he would meet dot and buddy black who would present to him the lawsuit of all times , one that would make him a rainmaker rudy jumped right in and fought for the black 's son donny ray who was diagnosed with leukemia and then later denied medical treatment by a large insurance company for no apparent reason rudy is thorough and compassionate in his work and never gives up the case he fights for his client even though he has little courtroom experience
this book really is an insult it 's lesson and assignments are horrible they ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book in a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read
i had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course unfortunately , the instructor never even flipped through it it is by far the worst photography book , really the worst book i have ever purchased ! there are typo 's , the example photos and instruction sometime are not the same the projects are lame and really teach nothing i would not recommend this book under any circumstances avoid at all cost ! ! !
edmund burke \( 1729 1797 \) wrote reflections on the revolution in france in 1789 which was four years before the rise of the fanatical jacobins and the execution \( murder \) of louis xvi this book was not only well written but very prophetic on the tragic events that were part of the french revolution burke showed historical insight and warned both the british and the french what was going to happen
in 1789 , the year of the french revolution , burke received a request from a good friend living in france to provide his thoughts on the revoution the result one of the finest pieces of political discourse ever written for those encountering burke for the first time , his adament defense of the crown , and of hereditary succcesion , seem to make a hypocrite of this self proclaimed liberal burke , however , was not defending an absolute monarch who ruled under the charter of divine right , but rather , pointing out the danger of a perfect democracy , whose sovereign \( the national assembly \) was compelled not to a moral authority such as a church , nor to a fixed consitution in short , liberty was safer restricted in civil socity , than left unchecked
this small title is actually a letter that the author wrote to a friend in france when edmund burke wrote this letter about the french revolution \( where the king was overthrown and beheaded by the masses aka jacobins \) , english scholars agree that the result was the finest piece of prose in the english language only a few poets have succeeded in writing something finer whether you agree with burke 's interpretation or not is not the point he penned the finest piece of literature ever in the english language
this is an indispensible essay for anyone who has ever been interested in politics it is composed of beautiful prose , crisp logic , and perennially relevant material
very good in the sequel line , but i figured out who dun it before i finished the characters are still developing well , waiting for the next one i have the whole series
boulder , colorado author , margaret coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal it 's always two looks ahead , of everybody else , she says using the wolf as metaphor , she gets the villain in her mystery novel the eye of the wolf at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters
margaret coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the wind river reservation in wyoming and describes the arapahoe customs in wonderful detail in this installment , father o'malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the arapahoe and shoshone indians has been re ignited , and that dead indians can be found on an ancient battle ground when father o'malley goes to investigate , he discovers three dead shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles things heat up when the young shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends vicky holden , the other main character in the series , has entered into a law partnership with adam lone eagle , and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling vicky wants to defend frankie montana , who is a suspect in the murders , and adam tries to persuade her not to take frankie as a client as always , author coel creates a wonderful setting and characters , and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series
it is hard to believe that margaret coel began her wind river reservation series some ten years ago with the eagle catcher , which introduced readers to father john o'malley and defense attorney vicky holden each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between o'malley and holden the latest installment in this series is no exception
the poetic macabre message shakes up father john o'malley , the jesuit pastor at st francis on the wind river plantation the caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths not long afterward , at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the shoshone betrayed the arapaho to the cavalry , three shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here
eye of the wolf by margaret coel isbn 0425205460 due out today \( 6 september 2005 \) i was sent an arc of this great book to read for review which i do gladly i had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them , especially spirit woman and story teller , so was expecting good things i was not disappointed the series follows the adventures of father john o'malley , pastor of st francis mission on the wind river reservation and tribal attorney , vicki holden and apart from a ripping good mystery , the author weaves the history of the arapho and the soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well , bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life it is not hard to care about the indian priest as they call father john or vicky holden i think what i enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well they were brought vividly alive by the author 's words from the first mystery message this is for the indian priest , everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield but does it \? \? this is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish
at a lunch with a studio executive , screenwriter john dunne was insisting on a story point in the script that he had written with his wife , joan didion , the excutive mimed reaching under the table and bringing out , the monster , their money , to win the argument seven or eight years they toiled on the script that became , up close and personal , this is the chronicle of their experiences fascinating and sobering , when you realize how things can dissolve and then reappear in a completly different form it is very well told and forshadows his health problems that cost him his life in 2003 , that his wife wrote so exquisitly about in the year of magical thinking if how movies get made is of any interest to you this and his other film making tale , the studio will fascinate you
it took eight years to make up close and personal , a movie about a television reporter and her mentor , starring robert redford and michelle pfeiffer this book , by one of the screenplay writers , is a must for anyone who wants an example of just how absurd movie making can be from the original story of jessica savitch , an ambitious and ultimately self destructive young woman , dunne 's screenplay transforms over many years and many rewrites into a story that would get disney 's stamp of approval , which translates into a feel good movie with an uplifting storyline often hilarious and at times moving , monster gives you a real feeling for the time , skill , and patience it takes to create a screenplay just remember this is not an instructional guide to screenplay writing , see it rather as a cautionary tale after reading this , you may wonder how movies get made at all
even though l m montgomery did not intend anne of green gables to be a series , she still captivates with her eager readers in anne of avonlea
how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said
being a l m montgomery fan helps of course , but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the anne of green gables which started it all the writing hold true to the author 's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series my wife and i have been reading these books for years and never tire of them again , as with her first work , you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time this particlar story starts where the last left off , anne is sixteen and her adventure continues i , for some reason , find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly
red haired with a flaming temper , the phenomenal anne shirley is back in her 2nd book ! marilla , a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing anne up \( when she was an orphan \) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins , davy and dora keith anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes like making his sister dora walk the pig fence ! davy \? \? s idea of fun includes violence and humor \? v but only for himself the girls have to teach davy manners , which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy anne \? \? s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again , but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world at school , she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students , especially paul irving , this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen he brings her flowers and calls her \? \? sweet teacher \? \? her friendship with striking gilbert blythe \( ex enemy for calling her hair \? \? carrots \? \? \) has grown , but what is gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant \? has diana \( her bosom friend \) finally grown up \? i really enjoyed this book because it talks about anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever i simply couldn \? \? t put it down because after every page , anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger my mom keeps telling me to go and do work but i cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written i like the others in this series also thank you l m montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life ! referring to the special collectors editio
i love this story echo lodge was great it was about the last book where anne is in avonlea and a little girl very excellent book
this is just a wonderful sequel to anne of green gables it deals with anne 's life after returning to avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college seeing anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad it is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the avonlea village improvement society \( to which there is some resistance from the avonlea elders at first \) anne is still of course a kindred spirit , but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures \( which was is just a touch sad , but as mr henderson says , all things must change \) for anyone who liked the first book , this is sure to not disappoint
it never ends , luckily ! ! ! i will never tire of anne 's wonderful , lively imagination in this story , anne is sixteen , with lovely dark red hair , gray twinkling eyes , and only seven freckles ! anyways , more happens in this story than a change in appearance anne becomes the avonlea schoolma'am , and loves her students like crazy , especially little paul irving , who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher anne and marilla even adopt little twins , who also win their love but when diana barry and anne are wandering down the lane one evening , they stumble upon the lovely miss lavender she has the same imagination too ! well , everything in this story is just as perfect as it 's prequel it 's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels in this case they 're both great
anne of avonlea was almost as good as the first anne book it is about anne 's life as a school teacher in avonlea marilla adopts two mischievous twins and mrs rachel lynde moves in so life is never dull for anne at the school house or at green gables you could read it on its own , but i recommend you read anne of green gables first
i read this book when i was 12 and loved it now i'm 21 and recendly read it again , and i liked it even more the plot is great the characters are alive , and the writing is superb a must for anyone that wants to laugh , love and cry with the town from avonlea
the book encourages students to explore their own strengths and weaknesses , and prompts them to recognize aspects of themselves in ways they probably had n't thought before most of us are quite curious about what our strengths might be , and with this book , the student 's self examination is n't a painful process rather than offering a step by step list of do 's and do n'ts , the approach taken here is to help the student develop a highly individualized action plan to help them take control managing their coursework it 's a relatively hefty book , at least compared to others i 've seen in this genre , but this does n't detract
this book is really helpful for those who have had difficulty with studying and time management it also helps highlight some of those everything i need to know , i really did learn in kindergarten moments often i do n't keep textbooks , because i know i 'll never use most of them again this book is exactly the opposite , in that i know i will use it again , be it with relationship conflicts , time management , a reminder to detach from my identities , or anything else there is such a wealth of helpful information , that i fail to understand the ranting low reviews apparently some people have nothing better to do with their time than bitch pity , really
i found this book to be full of endless tips on how to study and make the best use of my time and energy
the item was how it was described , and shipping was speedy it came in way before my classes even started awesom
it 's one of the best book i 've ever read or seen pages are all colorful and nice design very attracting the eye so we read more , and interesting story inside and motivational i totally recommend this book if you are trying to pursue a better learning skills wether you are in school or you just want to learn to learning about everything it 's useful book for you
this book was required reading for my introduction to the freshman experience class and it is a must read for everyone ideas and concepts found in becoming a master student can be applied to every aspect of life the techniques found in this book were very helpful to me as a student , an employee and as a person i highly recommend this book
whether it 's the war between bucky katt and fungo the ferret , rob 's ongoing battle to maintain control of the household , bucky 's never ending quest to consume a monkey , or satchel 's innocent view of the world , there 's something everyone can enjoy and relate to in this little gem of a comic strip it is one of the most witty , refreshing , and downright funny stips to come along in a long time
impact is a book my school has used for nearly a decade as an introduction to the short story , literary issues , and writing projects an excellent selection of 50 short short stories , impact follows up each story with a discussion of some appropriate literary term , a selection of questions that are actually worth answering \( as a teacher , i know how bad these usually are \) , and some really innovative writing topics the stories are all first rate , from shirley jackson 's charles to hemingway 's the old man at the bridge to arthur c clarke 's who 's there \? ost of the stories also hinge on some ironic twist , allowing that most difficult and valuable of literary concepts to be taught thoroughly although a bit pricey for purchase just to read , impact is also an excellent collection for anybody aspiring to write short stories they simply do n't get much better than these
during a very difficult stage in my life the lord led me to this book it is without a doubt one of my favourites i highly recommend it to everyone why \? well it teaches on lust and the reason we are sometimes tied to others in relationships that may sometimes not even be god 's will for our lives
i had originally purchased the 1st printing of this book and gave many of them away the cover was different and oh how i wish i had it now ! this book is great ! i cant really add anymore than what others have added here , but i can say please read this book , everyone should have this information under their belts i would however recommend reading the beautiful side of evil like many they are unable to see the reality of satan 's plans to get us off into something that can be so destructive and even move us out of god 's truth see how this women was fooled into thinking something she was doing was from god and then how god reveals the truth to her much the same about garry 's book , who by the way i have personally met the only difference between the 2 books is the story it tells
this book is great for people with a past it gives many examples of problems that have resulted from easily made mistakes it tells you how to avoid these mistakes yourself and how to build a foundation so these mistakes wo n't even come into play through the use of personal and second hand experience as well as scripture , dr greenwald teaches how to build a relationship with god and avoid and diminish relations with the devil absolutely amazing
this book offers invaluable insight to understanding soul ties and why it is imperative that they be broken it is a must read for people who are in relationships and still struggle with their attraction to their previous mates this book definitely sheds light on why the struggle exists and how to break the soul tie it is a personal favorite for me i recommend it to any single or married person
anyone at all interested in mexico should read this book this book is written in a style ala james mitchner it deals with a huge period of time , starting before the time of the aztecs and moves through to modern times the author keeps it exciting and accurate he covers the highlights of mexico city and because of it 's governmental centralization , the country of mexico itself , without becoming overly bogged down in detail if you are a fan of historical novels , this is a book you wo n't be able to put down
la capital tells an absorbing story by following the twists and turns of the history of mexico city the writing style is clear yet the author also gives a comprehensive history of the mexican capital of special note are the many anecdotes which provide much of the human interest for the reader my favourite was the story of irma serrena la tigresa , a presidential mistress
un libro que se lee sin mayor dificultad gracias al lenguaje sencillo pero preciso , y en esto radica la magia del autor que de ese modo nos motiva a continuar libre de tecnicismos antropolgicos histricos esta obra es recomendable para todo aquel que desee enterarse sobre mxico con una visin clara , veraz y hasta divertida
this is the definitive work on history of mexico city for the student of mexican history this is a well documented work for the casual reader it reads like a novel it should not be out of print
as a resident of mexico city , who has studied its history , la capital by jonathan kandell is the finest example of what a history book can be it reads like a page turner mystery and the publisher should hang their head in shame that the book has not been reprinted i 'll run out today and buy whatever copies are left in mexico , to give as gifts in the future
i read this book i do n't remember how many years back i think about 15 years ago and just remembering makes me nauseous , for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point i was younger , naiver and i got engaged , i confess that clever author no doubt , to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead just wandering around and playing with analogies i had the time back then , i guess today i only have the time to write a review stating how surprised i am today i could finish this kind of book i ca n't speak for anyone else , suffice to say i was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands
hofstadter tickles every curious and philosophical bone in your body this one is a long read with a lot of dense material if you take the time to get through it , while understanding all of it \( this ai n't no dime novel ! \) , you will find yourself sitting on such a mental high as you cannot yet imagine plus , you get to boast to all of your nerdy friends that you have read geb , but thats just a perk
this is professor hofstadter 's thesis those thinking about reading this book should do some research before doing so since it is over 25 years old
whenever i read a book in translation i often wonder if it 's the translator i love or hate , or the author themselves literature in translation is essentially a complete re writing of the book itself consider lewis carroll how does one go about translating seemingly endless word play and words that are often made up \? now consider the fact that alice in wonderland had been translated into over 50 languages if you could read all 50 languages , some would approximate your understanding of alice , and some would appear tangenital , or worse , dishonest to the original
i read this book in 1980 , and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering bas relief against all i read before or have read since what stands out the most , however , is that my thinking changed after reading this book everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter , which has quite simply changed my life perhaps a first reading today would not have an equal effect in 1980 it was timely things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then the internet , for instance but i 'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether g del , escher , bach an eternal golden braid is as eternal as the title claims for me , the answer is a resounding yes i can say without doubt that my life would have been different if i had not read it at that time
this book is a great way to expose yourself to new ideas , but , in the words of a previous reviewer , it was written by a passionate dilettante
plainly put , this book was a ride standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking he digs into many different scientific , mathematical , and artistic disciplines , and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing , but ultimately satisfying whole
i spent a good part of the day yesterday beggining a reading of geb and was fascinated at the way hofstadter looked at language and bach 's canons and fugues and there is much to come , i can tell although i consider myself an intellectual , i am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject , but hope that hofstedter is going to open that up for me , too
it 's the gifted individual who can make math fun it takes a complete master to do the same with godel 's theorem
this book is a masterpiece for me it accompanied me throughout a long journey that i took in europe in the past it is written in a poetic way that makes you think , reflect and enter into the fantastic world of the invisible cities of kublai khan 's empire , created by calvino marco polo works for the khan he has to visit many towns of the mongolian empire so that later he can share his impressions with the great khan this is mainly because the empire is so big that kublai khan would never be able to visit all towns of his empire
consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan , calvino 's fiction is sui generis , a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory oriented if on a winter 's night a traveler this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination , invisible cities is also , i am convinced , a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary dream city of venice , a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea
generally i like my books fast and plot driven , with minimal description and at least quasi linear plots lines while invisible cities is none of those things , i would rate it among my favorite books the prose is incredible , rich , almost erotic at times i felt my heart beating faster as i read it this is a book to linger inside of , to re read often , to keep by your bedside to read snatches of before you go to sleep
this book has become my favorite , equal to a few others , but unsurpassed in its brilliance to me through its poignant insights , fantastic imagery , calvino 's exploration of his willingness to write in abstract terms , and , for lack of a better way of describing it , the sunlight that beams from nearly every page of this book
i read this decades ago , when i was barely more than a child
immediately i can detect the luminous presence of magic in this slim volume although thin in pages , it is deep in meaning without much in the way of characters or plot , it sustains and enlightens laconic descriptions of fantastic cities woven together in a tapestry of voluminous nuance topics of memory , perception , vision , time , loss , longing , desire , death , signs , symbols and ultimately meaning are all carefully chosen and arrayed upon finishing this book , one has the feeling of have eaten a delicious meal too quickly that upon reflection , it should have been savoured slowly
the writing is pure seduction , whimsical , enchanting , all those words which mean totally freaking dreamy the problem is , for me at least , that it 's the sort of book that i ca n't read straight through it might take me a few weeks or a year probably because there is n't a plot to speak of anyway , expect poetry , get poetry and do n't let go of your copy because it 'll never come back mine did n't
i was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox read to me the book was far from the brainless entertainment i was hoping for in fact , invisible cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between marco polo and kublia khan at first i was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities through calvino 's use of symbolism i began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations this could have been the first time i really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams
readers and fans of calvino 's invisible cities may be interested to know that an entire hotel has been hand crafted on the theme of the book it is located on the balearic island of menorca , in spain each room is based on a different 'invisible city' i 've seen it , it 's amazing , no , it 's overwhelming , astonishing pictures are at www tressants com
my brother picked this book up in an airport on the way to mexico with my family he was literally laughing out loud for days and relayed sotries to me and my dad i decided when he finished it , i 'd give it a go , though i was unsure about some of the author 's views on women but let me say in short that i , as a 22 year old female , loved the heck outta this book
for starters this book is a good read , i rarely read and i knocked it out in a day and a half once you start reading it you wo n't be able to put it down you will talk about it with your friends and they will be clueless about what you are saying but you will not be able to stop so eventually they will want to read it and think you are the coolest guy ever for passing this book onto them if you like to party , drink , sleep with girls , treat others with complete disrespect , and basically live life to its fullest you will kill for this book have a good day and next time i see you , you better be tucker max drunk \( yeah read it and find out what that is punk !
tucker max is going to hell and i gladly followed reading his book brought non stop laughs and the occasional brimstone scorch i have been lucky enought to have a friend like this and realize life is better than it could have ever been because of it
if you just want to be entertained and dont mind if not a single deep thought will pass through your read while you read then this book is perfect i thoroughly enjoyed everyone wishes they had a tucker max in their life , cuz we 've gotta live vicariously through someone now we do and we can
yes i'm an actual girl who purchased this book , read it , and laughed until i cried if you are n't easily offended and enjoy a good drunken story , please buy the book
those of us who have been to college usually know at least one crazy guy who was always the life of the party and constantly entertained the campus with his antics tucker max is not one of these people
as a great fan of stand up and great comedy , i felt it was needed of me to buy this book it was never any regrets about it this book had me lying on the floor laughing several times , and is most lightly the best written piece of humor i have ever read i think this is a great book which everyone with a sence of humor should experience
great stories , crazy and simple , great lessons first book to have me laughing
this is a seriously funny book , as long as you are the sorta person who laughs when a mate farts
journey to the land of no is a first person memoir of a jewish girl growing up in iran during the revolution the book describes what her life and the life of her family was like before and after this cataclysmic event
amazing story , beautifully written it has all the elements of an exciting novel , and it is true , which makes it even more awesome
a persian friend gave me this book i could n't put it down , so poetic and real as we live in times of war and devastation , this book reminds us of the power of ideologies and politics
reading roya 's accounting of her ordeal gives one a profound feeling of the reality of the time it is amazing that roya 's experience had such an effect on her that the details still remain intact for her reproduce such an amazing book
laugh , cry , remember and connect to home ! roya makes you do all that , especially if you grew up in iran the beginning of the revolution enjoy and pass it along to all the women in your family
roya hakakian comes from a secular jewish family who identifies with iran the family is integrated into iranian life and roya looks forward to the wonderful changes that will come with the revolution this is the story about the changes that came to the ordinary people of iran the dying of hope , the hopelessness of change the story covers the lives of the hakakian family , singled out for being jewish , and the lives of the moslem and jewish families they know and who are their friends this is not a happy story it brings down to the indiviual level the failure of the islamic revolution in iran
the somber cover , the title , and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading this memoir is not especially dark or grim , and the journey it recounts is an internal one , more from the land of yes than no it captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times and the islamic revolution in iran becomes the worst of times for the community of 100 , 000 jews living in tehran in the late 1970s , as the monarchy is toppled and the ayatollah khomeini returns from exile to assume power
i used this memoir as one of three core texts for an intensive summer course and my students loved it it is beautifully written , poetic and very honest i lived in iran from 1983 to 1993 and i believe this is the most accurate memoir of life in iran that i have read
this beautifully written book explores the iranian revolution from the perspective of a young jewish girl hakakian is a delicious writer and her description of pre and post revolutionary iran is vivid and stimulating as a frequent reader of this genre , i found this book to be far and away the best in its category and highly recommend it to anyone interested in iran and the country 's current imbroglio , women 's studies or judaism
this is a beautifully written book that makes you feel like you are in iran at the time of the revolution ms hakakian 's prose brings to life the sounds , smells and feel of life in revolutionary iran , through the eyes of a young girl
a nice , simple good night book with no bells and whistles to get the kids active again at bedtime recommend highly
this was a favorite of my daughter 's , and she 's 42 now ! while she loved all the margaret wise brown books , as they came out , this always remained the favorite it must be in the genes , because the two oldest grandchildren , now out of college , loved it the best , too and now , the third grandchild , a 5 year old , is reading it to herself at night ! oddly , while one can find good night moon in any book store , a child 's goodnight book is never there until amazon , i always had to order it from the publisher we include it in the new baby presents we give to all the youngsters we know , and always get rave reviews from the new parents i think i 've ordered at least two dozen copies from amazon , since you all came along thanks
three generations of our family have used this book at bedtime and our current copy is taped together ! a soothing , rhythmic book that talks about pussycats , kangeroos , wild things in the forest , sailboats and engines all getting quiet and sleepy my grandson saves it as the last book to read and he falls asleep by the time we finish the little prayer at the end a very special book indeed
i used this book 10 years ago when i first began my career , and i still refer to it today it demonstrates the ability to direct kids in the correct manner while they develop their self esteem , and their independence it gives you ways to deal with negative situtations that allows the child to walk away feeling like they can be a better person and they will be !
the book povides suggestions and solutions for today 's classrooms it is also a good book to use as a quick reference for those disciplinary topics you may need very good
i recently re read as you like it prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival 's performance of this play under the summer stars here in boulder shakespeare \( 1552 1616 \) produced this romantic comedy in 1599 and published it in the first folio in 1623
as far as shakesepare 's comedies go , the comedy of errors will always be my favorite and while this as you like it never quite obtained the popularity of a midsummer night 's dream or the taming of the shrew , one probably could argue that as you like it is the best of shakespeare 's comedies this play contains several plots that shakespeare cleverly intertwines and it offers a happy ending with love triumphant but more important than the triumph of love , the theme of reconciliation carries through to virtually everyone in the story the story begins with the sibling rivalry of orlando and his older brother oliver who has hoarded the family inheritence after a brief fight , oliver hopes that orlando may accidentally die in a wrestling match against charles this is where a 2nd plot comes in the duke frederick \( who has a daughter celia \) has banished his older brother \( the true duke who has a daughter rosalind \) but for now , rosalind is allowed to stay and she has made good friends with celia orlando meets these 2 girls and falls into favor with rosalind after the wrestling match , things start to go bad orlando learns that his brother oliver is planning to kill him , and rosalind is banished but all is not lost orlando takes his loyal servant adam and flees while rosalind \( in the male disguise of ganymede \) , along with celia , and the comical touchstone will flee to look for rosalind 's father and here is where the play becomes mostly comical \( good comedies can often have a sad start the comedy of errors shows this well \) moving on , we meet rosalind 's father and his crew who have made exile into a paradise from duke sr 's party , we meet the melancholy jaques but he is arguably the most interesting character in the story \( in fact , the most famous passage from this play belongs to jaques the 7 stages of man which end in nothing perhaps macbeth took lessons from jaques 'tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow ' \) duke sr welcomes orlando and adam , and it is n't long before orlando and rosalind run into each other shakespeare maintains the comedy when rosalinde keeps her male disguise on and tells orlando he must practice wooing on him her touchstone has some comical romantic moments with audrey and there is an interesting triangle where the shepherd silvius loves phebe , but phebe loves rosalinde \( seeing only ganymede \) ! we may recall this from the 12th night when olivia loved viola in her male disguise but after this comical moment , all begins to resolve oliver comes on the scene and he and celia fall in love \( so much so that oliver is willing to reconcile with orlando and grant him all \) the play ends with not only the reunion of rosalind and her father , but the joyous weddings of rosalind orlando , celia oliver , audrey touchstone , and phebe silvius , but more good news comes celia 's father mends his ways and returns all to rosalind 's father jaques offers the crowning touch despite his cynical nature , he is not a villain ironically , this hermit type man converses with more characters than anyone in the story , and while he can not take part in the play 's final happiness , he does wish everyone well as i said , my favorite comedy will always be the comedy of errors but do n't make the mistake of overlooking this comedy
as with all of shakespeare , the concept of love at first sight is given far too much credit , but other than that , this is a delightful romp filled with much amusement the language is as beautiful as one expects in shakespeare , but is somewhat less difficult for the modern reader to follow than in some of his plays i found myself being more distracted than helped by most of the footnotes as with most shakespearean comedies , it was easy to see that this play was intended for the amusement of the common people the similarities in style between the plot here and in much modern pop culture were striking \( the sexual innuendo to be had when a woman passes for a man and finds another woman falling in love with her , for instance \) if it had a flaw , it was that the ending was just a little too pat and contrived , even for a comedy , but that 's just a minor quibble
whew this story has an even faster plot turn about than austen 's pride and prejudice if one is not careful , you like me , may suffer plausibility whiplash that said , as you like it is a delightful example of shakespearean comedy jaques is one of my favorites from shakespeare 's stable of characters things get renewed , folks get married , fortunes are restored good stuff i must also mention how much i like these signet classic shakespeare texts they are darn fine \( good intros , critical pieces , and source info \) and dirt cheap
this book was one of my best loved shakespeare 's plays it really gave me comfort and laugh whenever i read it i hope in real lifre i can find a forest like the one in the play so i can hide my self there and live as i like it rosaind is the best female character in the literature for her sense of humour and intelligence , and passion orlando reminds all those who ever loved of their first love , the bittersweet and compelling passion that one is not capable of getting rid of if you had spare time , you really should read this play , i guarantee the language in this play is not that hard and you will find yourself so into this fantastic tale once you started reading it
as you like it is bar none , one of shakespeare 's very best works it is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work , along with the equally \( or even more \) brilliant midsummer night 's dream , is the best example of shakespeare 's theme of the dream world vs the real world this play , especially the scenes in the forest , is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination it consequently can be read as a criticism of the real world , here represented by duke ferdinand 's court like many of the other comedies , shakespeare is mocking the ideal which many in his society would have praised though this play deals with some pretty dark themes \( which of his plays does n't \? \) it is a light hearted and fully enjoyable read
adrei makine 's book , dreams of my russian summer 's , is a very special book even though the author wrote the book in french , and i read it in translation \( english \) , the writing is fantastic it takes a little getting used to it , it 's very flowery , just to give you fair warning , but once you get used to it , you 'll appreciate it and despite all the attention given to the language , quite a bit actually happens , the dialogue does n't stand still it 's a moving and interesting story
a work of art , makine 's use of language is stunning not a quick read , i frequently had to stop and ponder many profound passages literature as an art form is not dead
i read that book in french \( le testament franais \) so it may be possible that the english translation is n't as good as the french one i found that book so wonderful and the progression of the boy from childhood to adulthood is so well described the images that makine creates are beautiful and you can clearly see them it 's an excellent book for the ones who like to think and to dream
time alters all things the resultant changes can be decay , or tedium passe , or at the opposite end of the spectrum the changes can be enhancing as a patina on fine wood andrei makine 's dreams of my russian summers has happily acquired a literary patina that makes this brief but crystalline memoir of childhood even more of a joy to read after a few years on the shelf makine has the rare ability to weave wholly credible stories with unforgetable characters while at the same time measuring his prose like poetry we are to suppose this is an autobiography , but it is far more than the journey of a nascent writer becoming a man this is the essence of the russian mind embellished by the great fortune of having early exposure to the beauty of france by means of recalling summers with charlotte , a french born grandmother who nourishes the imagination and history of the writer to the point of delirium all that has happened to and in russia from the time of the tsars to the present is presented in such a way that the grisly realities are always balanced by the homage to love of fatherland makine is a stunning writer and is still adding to our contemporary literature in ways that secure him a place among the geniuses of the word read and indulge your mind and your senses
i 've loved this book since a business english class where it was a requirement it makes it so easy to find your topic i no longer work in an office , but whenever i have personal correspondence that needs to be perfect , i find myself still reaching for this little gem
if you are looking for a great informative handbook to keep available at your desk in the office , i recommend how 9 handbook this is by far an excellent handbook to have how 9 handbook gives you information on grammar usage , memos , reports , and business documents the numbers listed on the front of the book , helps in finding the material you need easily clark amp clark hit a home run with this book also , if you need a little refresher course to enhance your skills , i recommend the how 9 workbook try them both for yourself ! ! every office worker should have one
this book was required reading for a college course however , had i found the book on my own i would have felt i struck gold ! how 9 is the tool to keep right on your desk allowing you to either learn or refresh skills from grammer and punctuation to proper format of an email correspondence or business letter
tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds i am invested in the vanguard s p 500 index as well as other index funds , but this is a bit too much if you understand the concept of indexing , save some cash and skip this book
this book has the fundamental of indexing and why we should consider it as part of building our financial portfolio bogle is at his best preaching the value of indexing and how it relates to lower cost investing this eventually translates to higher return for the investors and less profit to the brokerage firms that make money on trading
mr bogle , the founder of the vanguard group , does an excellent job explaining the value of indexing and shows historical and relative information that bases his knowledge on facts a great book for any investor , both new and experienced , that will help make your investment strategy more intelligent and educated especially if you believe that it 's almost impossible to beat the market on your own the book can be difficult to read at times , so make sure your energy level is high before you indulge
bogle , bob brinker , and jane bryant quinn sold me on the idea of index funds there are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to , as one money manager told me , be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute hogwash , especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds , only you pay the higher expense ratios
although a good resource book about the benefits of mutual fund investing , i found the title to be a bit misleading being the self proclaimed creator of index funds , bogle cites many years of comparative returns from mutual funds while making the case that , over the long run , investing in index funds will produce the highest returns i think a more apt title might be why index funds beat all
we believe that this classic work by one of the twentieth century 's great investment authorities belongs on every investor 's bookshelf published in 1999 , at the height of a notorious stock market bubble , it was a rare , sage , clear eyed appraisal of investment reality it remains relevant author john c bogle argues so strenuously for a low cost , passive investment approach based on index funds that you could almost accuse him of marketing hype after all , he did start vanguard , an investment company best known for its low cost index funds however , the evidence he presents to back up everything he says exonerates him fully today 's investors are not quite as eager as investors were in the 1990s to believe in the impossible dream of infinite wealth from the stock market still , many people waste their time and money trying to beat a market that the best financial research unequivocally shows is , for most people and over the long run , unbeatable bogle explains why , while recommending much needed reform of the mutual fund industry
everybody knows that asset allocation is the only significant factor in portfolio performance right \?
an eye opener for all mutual fund investors mr bogle 's logical arguments are backed by historical data and thorough analysis a must read
i saw the review by warren buffett \( and some other investing stars \) on the cover and that was good enough for me to check it out i was n't disappointed
it could also be titled
quick read that 's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children , and how that impacts the adult lives of those children
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good maybe better at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes \? of course not ! why , then , would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books , or a patterson and a connelly , or two thomas harris books my apologies , greg iles , but for a simple , formulaic serial killer book , blood memory was just way too long the book has two co plots one involves a serial killer who murders older men , the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting , but at least two thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles or his editor had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 3o , 40 or even 50 pages , but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera speak , meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths , these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream , taking showers , and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on , greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange , exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before \? just as some people love to hear themselves talk , i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good , blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
if you 're interested in forensics , chances are you 'll like this book the book also manages to tie in sexual abuse , repressed memories , miss , vietnam , ptsd , and a little romance it even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long i was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book 's plot and discussions as intricate as they are
based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes iles is a better writer than grisham , i picked up this book i do n't know if iles can outwrite grisham , but he is definitely a contender i found blood memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists but , it is on the grim side the main character pursues solving two mysteries , one a serial killer on the loose , and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie in the end the two mysteries are related , though i think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first 100 pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it
i guess it 's high praise for mr iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child free diving , drinking , valium , baths in scalding water
one of the boldest of the bold kudos to mr iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists nambla has been put on notice this is work of pure satisfaction , from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero , cat another worthy pile of words from mr iles , despite his ignorance regarding black people the dialog is downright embarrassing , but keep trying mr iles if you hang out with african americans rather than watch them on tv , perhaps you 'll get 5 stars next time
this is the first book i 've read by greg iles however , it will not be the last ! this book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues
as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse i found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person this book will stick with me a long time and i hope even though it is long , readers will give it the chance it deserves i thought this work by mr iles to be very insightful
this is romance in the classical tradition intelligent , witty , mysterious , and haunting i first read the book five years ago and have re read it several times since it is a pure pleasure to read for the beauty of the prose alone add to that the delights of some very interesting characters and descriptive passages that remain haunting long after the book is finished and you have a novel worthy of being called a romance
fabulous , sumptuous , and superb this is one complex , twisted , literary type book that is also fascinating and intensely readable i often start reading books of this genre with a sense of trepidation , because however good they are , they 're also so often dense and maze like with the vividness of the characters and plot bogged down in the author 's strivings for intellectual pyschological depth , with the result that the reader is always kept at a distance , struggling like a drowning man to feel empathy for the characters and to actually want to continue reading this book is different it flows along with an unselfconscious and almost effortless ease , establishing the characters as empathetic human people in our minds and moving the plot along without unnecessary jargon , while at the same time layering it with a rich tapestry of words , details , and emotions , so that the past and the present pictured in the novel weave together and reflect on each other i was stunned and carried along by the ease with which one sentence flows into the next , and riveted by the characters and the passion of the world i found myself in once in a long while i find a book in which i can actually feel my brain expanding at the depth and stunning simplicity of the author 's vision this is one of them read it it 's passionate and lyrical , rich and wonderful
not the type of books i usually read \( poetry and all \) and it took me quite a while to get into it but it was worth it the story is multi layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written highly recommended
i was very pleased with the quality of this dvd , and the relatively quick delivery nice job
before there was the davinci code , there was a story of two intrepid researchers fighting against time and exposure to find the truth that comparision out of the way , possession is a highly literary novel that deals with the reality of the cults surrounding famous literary figures and the idea of what would happen if one day some researcher stumbled on a scandalous past that was not in all of the major studies of their patron author
this book is one of kind fiercely intelligent , playfully readable , uncompromisingly intellectual , technically dazzling and more byatt succedes in being able to so deftly straddle that razor sharp boundary between writing a good book and making great literature that it almost makes me feel sorry for most other writers the language snaps , the story strides confidently along , the characters develop in such a way that they seem to bloom organically rather than to be creations of a singule ar mind and the plot has just enough twists , turns and surprises to make it an unlikely page turner extra praise should be lain for byatt 's ability to perfectly summon victorian poetic and epistolic forms and make them unite seamlessly with the book 's wider , postmodernist tone and philosophy of course , no book is without its faults , and this one probably has more than i would like to admit , but generally i found this to be an amazing book that i would recommend without hesitation
despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century , byatt , in all her annoyingly feminist glory , has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet each and every character is lacking in charisma , humour and , in fact , any other attractive facet about their personality , offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy , thus leaving no hero , so necessary to such a story
i read this book when it first came out , and read it again , last month
what is it about this book that transforms one into a hauntingly romantic magical place like no other some pages were rather tedious that i had to skip them , but still a very unique and unforgettable read i was thinking of giving 5 stars but felt that the writer was stilted and failed to be convincing as to the depths of feeling in the two main relationships , hence the 4 stars
possession is quite simply one of the finest , most engrossing books i have ever read
this is a wonderful story that everyman 's library has place in great binding
great expectations was a mediocre book i was not impressed i had to read this book for my 9th grade honors english class it was too long and boring i see were dickens was trying to go with the suspense , but it just made the book monotonous and boring the uncanny coincidences just did not seem real it 's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense , but this was just overkill every chapter was boring i got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with estella for the whole book also , the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time who cares about wemmick 's stupid plays \? this could all be summed up in a couple of page short story in conclusion , this is another swing and a miss for dickens stay far away from this book ! if you want to read a good dickens story , read a christmas carol and nothing else written by charles dickens
reading is n't usually something i choose to do in my spare time my daughter was reading this for school , so i decided to read it too because of her reaction to it this is not your every day novel ! the more i read it , the madder i got i could n't read it for an extended amount of time , because i would become too angry to continue but then i had to pick it up again to find out what happened this book is a pure emotional ride i love it
great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author charles dickens the main character , pip , grow up in the home of a blacksmith with both of his parents dead , he lives with his older sister and her husband named joe pip soon meets miss havisham and the beautiful estella that live wish her pip hoped that miss havisham intentions were to make his fortune , make him a gentleman and have estella to wed he was wrong , because the social class division leaves pip a worker , and estella was a lady after disappointment , pip hears news that a secrete benefactor want to make pip a gentleman and give him a fortune and informs him that he is a man of great expectation pip has no idea of who is benefactor is , but heads to london to start his eventful life as a gentleman even if pip work hard for his life but he is getting on well finally
this was an interesting book it is the first book by charles dickens that i had ever read the language was weird but that was because it was a british novel written in a different era i enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time i plan on reading several other works by this author it was slow to start but only because i was not used to the writing style or language i would recommend
this book sucks very badly ! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place ! !
charles dickens' novel great expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels in the united states , in the 21st century , people would rather read about romantic style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists dickens , however , chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of betrayal , duplicity , unfaithfulness , and a handful of other negative characteristics
i love to read great books like brave new world by aldous huxley or far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy i love the aeneid by virgil , the odyssey by homer i read both long versions of les miserables and the hunchback of norte dame by victor hugo i read the rise and fall of the roman empire by gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so i love to read
i hate this book it is extremely boring and it is way too long there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar do not read this unless forced to i like to read , but this nearly put me to sleep avoid at all cost
this book was very boring details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it a poll was taken and about 73 of the students in the school liked this book what does that show about the book \?
this is an adorable love movie for anyone it 's witty humor and charming story combine into making it the perfect romantic comedy ! it 's great for watching any time , or even when you 're feeling blue ! it 's sure to lift the spirits ! ! !
i have been a fan of this movie for years and have seen it well over 500 times although i found three minor erros in the transcript while i read the book , it was still great
i have seen this movie several times , and i still like it each time i review this movie , i can gain different thinking you 'll love it if you have it
oh , this was a really cute book i do n't really understand the
i never read tdwp , or any romance novel for that matter , but thought i might get a glimpse into the romantic expectations of women as revealed in a modern chick lit book this is a lighthearted , happy ending tale not meant to rival the collective works of dickens and any attempt to critique it as otherwise is really silly
ok , yes , this is n't the next great american novel however this book is a great chick lit to read when you 're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the nyc social scene similar , yes , to the devils wears prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book
i have not read the devil wears prada , but i have seen the movie i found this second book to be basically the same as the devil wears prada , with just a slightly different scenario i would like to see something a little more original from this author because i truly enjoy her writing style
this book is so lame i regret every minute i spent reading it
i really enjoyed this book so much that i lent it to my mom , an avid romance reader i love the book club idea , i would totally do that i enjoyed this book much more than the first one the whole thing with the boss was n't all negative , just there was the problem of having a boss near your age and should you be friends or not and the idea of having your dream job that is more of a nightmare , was really great too in all , it was what i needed , a fun read for a long airplane flight
twenty something bette lives in manhattan , has a close knit group of friends , enjoys romance novels , and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity iq everyone worth knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations , and finds romance real and fictional along the way
i simply adore this book and it 's what made me go out to buy every other nora roberts novel it just amazes me the chemistry between luke and roxanne everytime i read it i ca n't get over the excitement and the smile it brings to me as they barb back and forth it 's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops roxanne is smart and sassy and luke is just too cool this romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me my very favorite romance
magic , mystery , romance and burglary are all part of this extremely captivating adventure i fell in love with the characters immediately even knowing they were good thieves hence honest illusions the book begins with luke callahan coming back into roxanne nouvelle 's life after a 5 year absence and then immediately flashes back to the time approximately 10 years previous when roxy was 8 and luke 12 when luke joined the carnival w max nouvelle , his daughter , roxy , lily , mouse and their right hand caretaker back in new orleans , leclerc the flashback continues throughout more than half of the book , setting up the reader for the background information needed to tell the full story i felt it was necessary and definitely kept the reader interested to go back to the beginning , unlike some of the reviewers who felt the flashback was too long the book then picks up to the current time , but to me , the continuity of the story completely hinged on the background information since i do n't want to give any of the plot away , i will end my review right here this is a story that i would definitely re read and hated to see end a sure fire plot for an excellent movie
i read the review and got the book and fell in love with it i think nora is a great writer i have read other of noras book but i like this one the most i would definatly recomend it !
it is difficult to find books in this genre that have a new flare to them usually the story lines are similiar as well as the characters this had some of that , but the magical part of it , made for a new twist to the average story line
this is one of my favorite nora roberts book i have read it several times luke is a great hero \( even if he is a thief \) and i just fell in love with him
this book has everything love , greed , murder what more can you ask for \? this book was one of the first romance novels i ever read , and i still have my original copy , that belonged to my mother i love to read it over and over again luke and roxy are two of my favorite characters usually , the background characters tend to fade , but those in this book , max , mouse , lily , and even mike the dog are all memorable
when i began to read nora roberts , i really did n't expect to be drawn into her novels the way every one said i would be boy , was i wrong ! this is an original story , i 've never read a romance that was this intricate and well written
the addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy , but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher instead , visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre look in the acknowledgments section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author 's agent and the book 's editor those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site \( anywho com , dogpile com , etc \) and give them a call if they are receptive to your idea , send them a formal proposal
this book really sucked ! save your money ! the i have tried to contact mr herman about some of the problems i have encountered with the contact addresses he provided he has yet to respond , meanwhile , i have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance one other note , many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent , and had n't been for quite sometime
sure , the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in sing sing but of the five queries i sent out based on the information in this book , two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown maybe i picked the only five bad addresses in the book , or maybe current it is n't
the contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book if you want names and addresses , use the internet if you want a book that can actually help you get published , read the square guide to publishing your non fiction book by rudy shur
and when did n't buy a new edition and i got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls , i got published i know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition all i can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily , thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has \( lol \) , but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track this book wo n't help you do it
what can i say about a book like this that has n't already been said \? it 's a tremendous piece of work and a great help it 's 5 stars worth of information
this is the indispensible book when seeking a literary agent
if you have what it takes to publish \( you write well and are writing something saleable \) , then this book will help you learn the steps you should take to get an agent and publisher read and take the advice his book offers as the information is as valauable as gold for those wanting to make money getting published as a first time writer , i have found success by reading and acting on this information it happened more quickly than i would have expected do n't let other reviews dampen your spirits to write and publish i you want to get published , you need this book
i think mr kiyosaki became indeed rich with his rich dad , poor dad series and rightly so however this particular book is just repeating of the same ideas i have seen in his other books with not much new information related to investing as the title suggested in any case i do recommend reading the original title rich dad , poor dad what the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not !
motivational and inspiring , this book is a rich dad classic , offering investment advice specifically on taking advantage of current assets problem \? does n't tell you how to gain assets other suggested titles to supplement this 097883460
this is a great overview that has helped me personally and when explaining real estate investments to my clients information is absolutely power in this case
this is a repeat of the first 2 books for the most part i do understand that the rich dad classics are n't meant for tips and specific methods of making money , but rather a rich mindset
kiyosaki 's third book in his rich dad , poor dad series delivers again this book is a logical progression of rdpd and cfq building on his principals of building wealth for the first half of the book afterwards , kiyosaki unveals what the reader has been waiting for just how the rich invest he disclaims the book plainly for the reader looking for the next hot stock tip or get rich quick scheme the book delivers on it 's title from a principal information standpoint , which should suit readers that realize that wealth is built up over time and based upon timeless principals and a strong foundation the last two phases of the book are extremely well written kiyosaki covers financial ratios , ipo offerings , taking companies public , and of course real estate principals he presents his information to get you thinking not to give you answers for he knows the answers will come if the action is initiated another aspect of kiyosaki that i particularly like is that he discusses his failures , which should let the masses know that riches are often found after many failures \( more often it is the norm \) so if you want easy answers do n't buy this book if you want principals , ingredients for success in building wealth , and systematic structure on what you should be thinking in acquiring and keeping your wealth this is your book !
excellent book , truly a must rea
some have reviewed this book as a more of the same from kiyosaki , more of what you can find in rdpd , but for me it 's , first of all , the best of all kiyosaki 's books , always remembering that is best to read the first two before , though not estrictly necessary , but the main issue here \( the nice thing about kiyosaki \) is that more than simple concepts , is that he helps you change your mind , where all poverty or richness reside after all , so the more you read , no matter if it may seem repetitive , the more insights you get kiyosaki is full of lessons , lessons that are easy to read and understand , but maybe hard to appropiate into one 's personal life everyday i personally have started reading the bokk fir the second time and i discovered that many of the concepts i read the first time had n't got me or taken me as they have now for me , not only a must read , a book to study
this book is for changing your mind set on investing , it does not give specific advice in what stocks to by or where to buy real estate , etc
i am not a fan of robert kiyosaki i find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense while he introduces some worthwhile ideas , i do n't think he develops them enough to be useful
i just read a small excerpt of this book which i read in its entirety many years ago i found the writing especially lively and interesting
i heard of this book 40 years ago when a tv version won an emmy award i was inspired to read it after my most recent trip to italy growing up as an italian american , i wondered why my people acted the way they do , and this book provides valuable insight barzini graduated from columbia u , and it shows in his command of the english language this book is a classic , but like most classics , it 's old , so while much of it is timeless , other parts are out of date , both culturally and politically however , if one wants to gain a grounding in the italian culture , this book is a very good place to start
it`s a classic book and you can hardly add anything to it though it`s a little dated , it`s still worth reading
first , i would compliment jim paris' intelligent review mr paris leaves me little to add what mr barzini did not foresee was the radical changes the last forty years would have on italian culture divorce would never be acceptable to the italian people , writes barzini confidentally yet only a few years after this book came out , divorce was legalized in italy mr barzini must have really be perplexed when the next level of cultural degeneration was achieved abortion rights writing in the italy of circa 1960 , mr barzini must not have thought the concept of abortion would ever be a part of italian life yet abortion became commonplace in italy within mr barzini 's lifetime he must of felt a foreigner in his own land that he so much loved
i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character \? people are just too different , too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history , socio economic patterns , religion , family , etc but the specific results are just that , specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page myself , i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you
wherever jack reacher goes trouble seems to follow he ca n't even have a quiet cup of coffee without a crime taking place in front of him this is the 10th book in the reacher series and they seem to be getting better and better ca n't wait for the next one to come out
this is must reading for thriller addincts mr child at this best
the hard way was a wonderful adventure to listen to the audio version was beautifully produced and the reading was the best i have listened to karl arnd
i'm not sure why this character is so engaging but he is there are only a few authors whose books i buy in hardback rather than waiting for the soft cover but lee childs is one i would n't call this his very best reacher novel , but as always it 's interesting , intense and a great way to pass an evening or two
traveling do gooder jack reacher is minding his own business , drinking a cup of coffee in an outdoor cafe in new york when he happens to notice a man get in a car and drive away the next edward lane want to know just what he observed , as it seems the ransom for the kate and jade lane , his wife and stepdaughter went away with that car
my reacher books \( i'm in australia \) all come with the blurb on the back cover heralded by jack reacher men want to be him women want to be with him personally i think this is cheddar city and actually detracts from the books appeal to the uninitiated if they had n't been recommended to me i 'd have probably picked one up , seen those 3 lines and gone 'gag , no way' i think i 'll tell lee child myself via his website i'm a woman and i'm not reading the reacher books to go gooey over jack 's attributes ! i will say this , they are cracking good reads and i hope he does n't make the mistake of writing more in the third person message to lee above blurb not a selling point ! cheers
this is an excellent addition to the reacher series reacher is relying more on guile than violence these days , and this outing requires his inflicting only some broken bones and i believe four fatalities the plot is nicely convoluted , although a clever reader will early on suspect that all is not as it seems the characters are well developed , and the major locales new york and rural england are evoked more than adequately lee child 's work is definitely a cut or two above the field in all respects , with the writing quality more than high enough not to present distractions from the story
some of the reacher novels such as the killing floor have been incredibly good , but i was genuinely disappointed in this one the author describes reacher as heroic , a loner , etc , but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told phrases , such as back in the day , get repeated much too often reacher has become a caricature of himself
with several hundred amazon rave reviews , it seems overkill to add another , but what the heck the lincoln lawyer is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best connelly 's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars \( the drinking bars as well as the ones before which you conduct trials \) borders on magic the plot here is amazingly diabolical just when you think you know where it 's going , connelly pulls the rug away haller is a wonderful character , delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a \( somewhat tarnished \) heart of gold i hope connelly keeps bringing him back but i hope he does n't retire bosch , either i think connelly should turn out two books a year one of each guy i know it wo n't happen , but i can dream thanks again , mr connelly , for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights
how do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you 've ever read \? this was a well paced , highly entertaining story , but the book 's real success is its longevity you continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it hands down , this is connelly 's best novel few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end mick haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works to him , it 's a machine , and he 's the greasy angel who keeps it well oiled even though haller 's cynicism is a constant source of amusement , his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client , who can pay top dollar accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman , louis roulet hires his services what first seems to be a straight forward case , will ultimately test haller to his limits his family will be threatened , he will be accused of a crime , and someone very close to him will die not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system , the writing is first rate
i got this book unabridged on cd i would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects my wife and i usually have our own books that we 'll read together , but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too , even though she was n't listening to it to begin with upon discovering i had listened to some without her , my wife was like , what \? you listened to it without me \? ! my response was , i did n't even think you were listening to it that 's how hooked you can get on this story
michael haller 's life revolves around criminal defense , his an attorney operating out the back of his lincoln town car his appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy , people either called him mick or mickey tall , dark and intelligent with his good looks and irish blood lines made him a catch in the court room he was very together with great timing , in his personal life it was a mess , at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter his father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to , his father wrote books and practised law that did n't have room for innocent clients , so far mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just would n't recognize innocence if it came along being an independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll , he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who could n't afford to pay his fees in total he kept four lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour , what he was really looking for was a franchise player , a case to keep the cash rolling , point blank a meal ticket
very interesting cast of characters , would make an enjoyable tv show , more original than what is on today
connelly really brings the characters to life the farther into you get , the faster you want to turn the pages
the lincoln lawyer is hilariously and profoundly true if you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a high powered criminal attorney , this book will show you i am a civil attorney , myself , and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law \( not that civil trial law is without its warts either \)
michael connelly is the best , and this new direction will hopefully going to continue good read
i loved this book the pacing was perfect , the characters well drawn , and the writing style engaging mickey haller , the lincoln lawyer of the title , and protagonist , is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his lincolns he gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker the author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read this is the first michael connelly book i 've read , but based on this one , i'm going back to read his others
criminal defense attorney , mickey haller , is thrilled to find himself in the position of defending louis ross roulet against a charge of attempted rape and aggravated sexual assault with grievous bodily injury for his alleged attack of reggie campeau , a hooker with a past roulet is what experienced attorneys call a franchise client he 's willing to be billed full schedule a top dollar legal fare , he 's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense but roulet 's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens haller because , despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not , haller becomes convinced of his client 's innocence he recalls his deceased father 's advice to other lawyers , the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man

exiled cubans in miami up to 1987 this is real old stuff i wonder why this book is still being published felt like a collection of shorter magazine newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book many long , disjointed sentences could use an updating there must be better books out there about this topic
didion produces a masterful detailing of miami history through cuban immigration and their rise to power in the city highly recommended
the story of the cuban exiles in miami deserves to be told with drama and passion because that is what it has been in this page turner , joan didion captures the rejection and racism that the cuban exiles first encountered in miami when they emigrated from cuba after castro assumed power she shows how some of the cubans became successful businesspersons , political powerbrokers , shapers of local culture , renowned humanitarians and philanthropists , expert propagandists , able diplomats , drug runners , muggers , and internationally renowned terrorists
i read this book so many years ago , but i just now realized i had never shared my opnions about it i had lived in miami for about eight years , and i think i was in my 5th year or so when i finally heard about miami by joan didion it was only after i had finally moved to the beach that i happened upon it , at kafka 's at any rate , it is an excellent book i think about it every time i hear on the news about the bumbling cia or news of castro makes the nytimes incidentally , 1987 also saw the publication of the corpse had a familiar face , by edna buchanan , another equally excellent non fiction book about this city i also highly recommend a book of common prayer by ms didion
d is for deadbeat is an odd story kinsey is hired to give 25 , 000 to a fifteen year old should be simple , right \? not with sue grafton writing the book ! ! when kinsey 's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting ! ! next kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check , he was dead now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid !
the client came to kinsey millhone with an easy job she thought deliver 25 , 000 to a fifteen year old kid a little odd , and kinsey was n't sure what to make of this thing so she takes alvin limardo 's retainer check anyhow it turns out that his real name is not alvin limardo , but john daggett and the check of course , is as phony as he is john daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals but he was n't just a deadbeat by the time kinsey caught up with him , he was a dead body with a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead there was four in particular that really wanted him dead kinsey knew his death was no suicide it was a plan to kill john but which one of the four did it \? kinsey must put her detective skills to work and find out someone 's secret
i found this to be one of the best of sue grafton 's books so far i found it extremely suspenseful and was guessing all the way up to the end as to who was the murderer the ending surprised me and saddened me i have found myself engrossed in the series and ca n't wait to get on to the letter e
private investigator kinsey millhone is back again in this fourth installment of sue grafton 's alphabet series this time she is offered a fee to give a 25 , 000 cashier 's check to a young man named tony gahan the check for the fee bounces and kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her , plus the young man she is to give the cashier 's check to everything she finds out about her client is bad he is a drunk , who has killed several people in a car wreck , and appears to be a bigamist when he is found dead , kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives this book is written in grafton 's usual breezy style , and kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book i would recommend the whole series to mystery lovers
sue grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting four books in and i still ca n't wait to read more ! and she gets better with each book in this book \( and to a smaller degree in 'c' \) there were many times where i could n't fathom how kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case but she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest kinsey 's development as a character is also very well done she is a very real , likeable person with amazing depth

free trade is great when you 're rich and powerful enough to ram it down the throat of other nations the multinationals , who benefit from massive subsidies \( aeronautics , computers , metallurgy , you name it \) are more than happy to have members of the bought priesthood of academia distill fantasies about the joys of the alleged free market not a word in this book about the public subsidies that become private profits , with a huge military and growing prison industrial complex for the millions of people who are superfluous to the plans being made \( undemocratically , of course \) in geneva and bonn corporate tyranny and its servants are destroying the environment , labor protections , the public sphere , and cultural diversity goebbels would be impressed
i like this book because it is very interesting and informative i began reading it for pleasure , but by the time i was half way finished , i was sure of its serious nature and had decided to adopt it as a required reading in the seminar that i teach on the economic impact of globalization the author succeeds in presenting the right mix of theory and history with sufficient analysis it is well researched and very well organized it should prove as interesting to the general reader as it is informative for the academics however , its treatment of classical economists is far superior to the section dealing with contemporary writeres on free trade hopefully , in the second edition the author will remedy this shortcomeing
preeminent economist and npr poster boy paul krugman 's review of this book is online
as a graduate student , i have gradually acknowledged the hidden rules of practicing sciences that , unfortunately , has never disclosed themselves during the regular programs this book demistifies science and its practioners in the field using scientific methodology this book becomes my favorite text at the expanse of t kuhn
i bought and downloaded the ebook of this famous book for my research
latour 's book science in action is more trendy but i suggest you read this earlier book instead it 's clear and makes its points in a compelling fashion
i give this book a high rating because of its influence in the field it is the first case study of laboratory science ever published , and is often quoted in anthropology , sociology , and philosophy of science the book 's conclusion is social constructivist in nature , to a very extreme degree scientific facts are not discovered , they are constructed through social processes the actual study was done by latour , a french philosopher , and the method was to assume strangeness that is , latour pretended he did n't know anything about what the scientists were doing and tried to make up \( construct \) an account the usual problems with relativism plague latour and woolgar 's brand of social constructivism , most notably issues with reflexivity if scientific accounts are constructed and do not have to do with the phenomena , why should we think that laboratory life tells us anything about the phenomena of laboratory science \? their answer is that we should n't the only question in evaluating texts is , are you convinced \? if not , fine come up with a better \( more persuasive \) account people who think that science , philosophy , and academe in general should have something to do with the real world will be horribly frustrated by this conclusion but everyone should be frustrated by the fact that the conclusion just does n't follow from the data latour gathered it seems to come entirely from prior convictions of the authors i recommend reading the book , however , because of its popularity and because it is a fantastic exemplar of a bad relativist and constructivist argument get the revised edition , which has a postscript and extra references for a chuckle , look up some of the reviews \( cited in the 2nd ed references \) from scientific journals they are mostly cheerful recognitions of the book 's subject matter \( laboratory science \) without any reference to or argument with the strong anti realist claims it makes you wonder if these people acctually read the book
h g wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent , world dominating british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way , particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world \( read colonize \) for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that attitude on a pedestal , and although he did n't knock it down , he made his point and in spectacular fashion in one way , the martians were the conquering british , with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the british despite their firm belief in their world destiny could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british \( or anyone else 's \) false boast of superiority in the end , though , it 's a hopeful book just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world , wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british \( alien \) way was not the native way of life in the colonies , suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that , it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense
war of the worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but i kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to hg wells' original story , especially the mis judged spielberg cruise flick so i decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by the modern library looked rather sleek and sexy i know it 's sad , but i like my books to look good
beware the war of the worlds is nothing like the movie with tom cruise it 's better it 's interesting to look back at at life 100 years ago and see how they used the little technology they had to fight off the enemy this book is entertaining if you can put yourself in the era that it was written it 's not easy to understand , however there is a lot of old english
i consider the war of the worlds to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time it has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time the original story is set in england at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story
the martians have arrived let the war begin a catchphrase that could easily be employed for herbert george wells 's most acclaimed science fiction the war of the worlds this is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on mars composed in a first person narrative , the war of the worlds is a gripping saga of the millions of people 's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good
h g wells' war of the worlds is a wonderfully imagined science fiction novel but it is also a biting commentary on its era and on the evils of british imperialism in the late victorian era
i 've been reading novels for a long time , i like sci fi , but sometimes i'm very selective when buying a sci fi with war of the worlds , well , this was different i 've seen the different films , etc i decided to read the novel to my surprise it was more interesting than any of the movies or any other thing i 've read
transgressions provides readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors there is a gritty 87th precinct novella from ed mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from joyce carol oates steven king is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky co workers
after the success of his novel blackboard jungle , evan hunter \( ed mcbain \) turned to what were then referred to as novelettes , his subject being the 87th precinct detectives of isola \( think new york \) as time passed , the 87th precinct novelettes grew to full length novels fifty years later , mcbain persuaded nine other mystery , thriller , and horror writers to submit what are now called novellas of around a hundred pages each
hopefully ed mcbain 's effort in convincing a stellar cast of fellow writers to contribute the novellas that comprise transgressions will induce publishers to encourage more of the same
from what i 've read , it seems like a lot of readers bought this just for the king novella while king 's short novella excellent , i highly recommend you read all the others , too there 's a lot of good material in this big book
as the editor of this compilation \( ed mcbain , aka evan hunter \) says , novellas are rather unusual these days , although in the old pulp fiction days they were fairly thick on the ground a novella is , as defined in the publishing world , a story that is longer than a short story \( which usually runs up to 5 , 000 words \) and shorter than a novel \( usually more than 60 , 000 words \) , somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 , 000 to 40 , 000 words and apparently a novella \( sometimes called a novelette \) is hard to write because it tends either to compress to a short story or expand to a novel yet , the ten writers here , none of the neophytes , met their charge from mcbain to come up with a genuine novella with aplomb \( except perhaps for stephen king , whose novella really reads like a short story but then he 's a big enough name that it 's no surprise that his story made the book without any criticism \) as in any collection there are some hits and some misses , but in fact i was engaged by every single entry some , though , were a cut above the rest walter mosley 's 'archibald lawless , anarchist at large walking the line' and lawrence block 's 'keller 's adjustment ' \( i will admit that i tend to read everything these two writers produce and they are particular favorites of mine mosley , in fact , i consider to be one of our best writers , regardless of genre \)
novellas are an odd duck , significantly longer than short stories and much shorter than full length novels i suspect that it takes considerable self discipline to maintain one 's focus for from between 10 , 000 and 40 , 000 words \( which may explain why novellas are infrequent \) whatever it takes , ed mcbain inveigled a terrific coterie of writers to create a series of wonderful stories which can keep you going from the beach to the mountains

reviewing an anthology like this is rather difficult the best way is probably to divide them into three groups
oh my god i passed up buying the complete short stories of raymond chandler for this one mcbain , mosley , king , westlake , deaver , and block sharing the same book \? and , mind you , not with any skinny little throwaway , wrote in a weekend , virgin bloody mary shorts , but with big phhhhhat novellas the novella is one of the greatest lost forms of detective fiction a dense , polished gem waiting for future generations to find in a dusty magazine pile or anchoring an obese anthology
ralph ketcham certainly some respect i had for him when he , in the middle of patrick henry 's speech , inserted , here mr henry strongly and pathetically expatiated on the probability of the president 's enslaving america
remember what happened to tom paine \? crucial to the revolution discovered corruption in congress was hounded out of the country they were wise to be worried and so was the south there is a stronger case for states rights today than ever before the european union offers a model of a federation of sovereign states whose central government only controls common interests and does n't interfere in direct taxation or local law , but by importing the universal declaration of human rights \( itself based on paine 's rights of man \) into law it gives certain guarantees which have hardly been mentioned in the us \( prisoners' rights for instance \) equally the canadian constitution is a good model for a modern constitution \( it includes the rights of women ! \) these guys could see the problems how do we get our 'representatives' to see the problem \? by turning the us constitution into a kind of holy document , we actually work against the ideas of the people who first conceived it this book is an excellent one to give those 'constitutionalists' who would rather not think for themselves
these often intense and firey speeches made by the anti federalists or the detractors of the constitution \( as it was being written and then debated \) are powerful , passionate and sharp enough to make one feel these words were meant to be weapons , i e , the front line defense of the freedom and liberty we so easily take for granted today i feel that much of what is wrong in our political system today was predicted here , and what would constitute the only real solution , i e , active , democratic citizenship , is also demonstrated here in their willingness to fight against tyranny with reason and passion how much greater our public debates would be today if this were required reading for all citizens ! politics would be thought well of again and refer to what citizens do in noble service to communities , close to home and far away do yourself a favor , get inspired again as to the original principles and purpose of democracy , read this book , and believe again ! and do something
i have yet to read a dean koontz tale that i dislike he has such a flair for bringing me into the tale as though i am experiencing it myself once i start a koontz novel i find it difficult to go to sleep until i am done i enjoy them so much it seems like a guilty pleasure , but it 's just a pleasure , no guilt involved
i enjoyed this book , detailed plot and different than most of his other books
dean koontz 's latest novel is a great thriller that i found myself not wanting to put down like stephen king , i feel some of dean 's best writing is when he is not involving the supernatural playing card in the deck the characters seem a little deeper , the story very plausible , and the tasks , tragedies and triumphs a bit more heartfelt , making you , the reader , care that much more about the outcome
a real page turner i let one coworker borrow this book and then the next , i wonder if it will make it back to my bookshelf buy it , you will not regret
this story hooks you immediately and keeps up a fast pace throughout if you like koontz 's style , you wo n't be disappointed with this entry
again and again dean koontz surprises and delivers with phenomenal books this is an excellent read , and i highly suggest it for fans and first time koontz readers alike
i had rated this book a two in relation to other koontz books i have read the book is entertaining enough , but is not very unique in relation to other books that koontz has written koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning , but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one
the husband was a good read nothing over the top , just a straight forward suspense novel dean koontz is always an enjoyable read
i listened to this while driving cross country it definitely helped the time pass by and was entertaining , but it did get a little slow at times
farmer in the sky is one of 14 juvenile science fiction novels written by robert a heinlein \( stranger in a strange land , the puppet masters , etc \) between 1947 \( rocket ship galileo \) and 1962 \( podkayne of mars \) it is not one of the author 's best works , but probably the most typical that is , the best single example of his work , fitting , in more ways than one , right in the middle heinlein 's juvenile novels are all exceptionally well written , as entertaining and enlightening for adults as for teenagers , but appropriate for kids to read each novel \( with a couple exceptions \) deals with space exploration in settings that expand on the previous novels first , the moon , and later on , the stars

this is the book that should have shipped with every copy of sharepoint portal server 2003
this book is like the 'da vinci code' for sharepoint it has a lot of information a lot of information the problem is , the layout and order of presentation in the book make it almost impossible to read and find information loading the included disk is a requirement use the pdf and search electronically for the information because the printed index is incredibly lacking
this is an excellent resource for sharepoint portal server 2003 i especially like the fact that it comes with a searchable electronic version of the book on cd along with some other useful tools and examples
as a new sharepoint administrator , this book has been a valuable tool during the implementation process of my site bill does a great job of explaining some of the more difficult to understand features in language that is easy for even beginners such as myself to follow if your task is to implement a new sharepoint site , this book will be your best friend
this book is very thorough there 's some great chapters on customization and server management information that has been non existent until microsoft released this book i have bought every book available for my team and this is the only one that covers sharepoint as deep on the topics of administration , search , configuration and architecture the book cd has a lot more as well my team references this book frequently to me , it 's the first true sharepoint administrator 's book available
it 's hard to find a good resource soup to nuts on things like search and many configuration items this book does a great job of explaining quite a few items it 's also very helpful in developing user documentation as many steps are clearly spelled out the cd it comes with contains quite a few very helpful web parts and utilities this is a must on any sharepoint admin 's bookshelf
i have been using the microsoft resource kits on many products over the past 10 years and the sharepoint 2003 kits is one of the most comprehensive produced to date for a microsoft application the book is designed as a resource kit to pull together all relevant information in one location
sharepoint as a technology is a tremendous product this book , however , does not come close to doing it justice i found the verbiage to be incoherent in various places , and occasionally terms were simply never defined further , at one point the author says at the time we had to go to press with this chapter , the information on how to use microsoft sharepoint server 2003 extranets was in the beta stages of being written when i purchased this book about sharepoint products and technologies , i assumed the author would be able to write about sharepoint portal server 2003 without requiring other authors to pave the way in short , this book seems to be a repurposing of information from other sources in a pell mell fashion consequently i cannot recommend it
tom wolfe pursues the idea that many americans and brits since world war ii have been checking out of mainstream status competition in favor of pursuing status within distinct subcultures this plays out in some interesting ways most notably wolfe watches natalie wood pursue status in a more traditional way by acquiring knowledge of art and even some old masters , while others play their own status game around photographing celebrities , in this case wood herself essays on hugh hefner , california surf culture , and london mods are also worthwhile , as is a comic piece on wolfe 's misadventures with an automated hotel wolfe does bog down at times , however , in the minute stylistic details of the groups he covers if you are not that interested in style in and of itself , your eyes may glaze over those passages still , this is a good read for anyone interested in subcultures \( especially of the 1960s \) and status seeking
i have read this book two times , once as a teenager and now 40 years later it is a great book and easy to read i was amazed as a teen ager , and now , how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around america in a camper and write about it he can do more than write well about things , he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him
i was n't too into this one i'm a big fan of steinbeck 's fiction , but this memoir is rather dull i was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of america at the time he wrote it but as an older man \( as he even admits \) he is n't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths the ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he does n't have too much to say
favorite memories of this book come from years ago when i could not put the book down as i read of steinbecks travels with his poodle for those whose minds wander and wonder about the roads , towns and people of the u s , i highly recommend this book i am purchasing it to read again
this book is vital and interesting , even across the gulf of the 40 odd years since it was written steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60 's generation gap and even the far side of post world war ii industrialization and urbanization
first i must admit to a certain bias here i travel a lot , i travel with a dog as a companion and i enjoy reading this particular author i was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date i can relate to this work ! that being said , this is one of those books that i have reread several times over the years , and year after year , i find that steinbeck 's observations contunue to be relevant this is a very easy reading book i do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though , that this is not a novel \( despite what his son said \) ! it is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author 's eyes it is interpreted through the author 's past expierences and how he preceives the world i am sure that any ten \( or one hundred \) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten \( or one hundred \) different stories and interpretations of those stories i shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations others i did not that is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read , or better yet , talk to others , and agree or disagree , enjoy their views i certainly cannot fault the author 's usage of language , syntax and organization it is all good solid steinbeck this is one of those books that can be read on several levels you can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in america , or , as i do , you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author as a side note i do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring i can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies , t v etc of this day and age i might suggest though , that you give it another read in a few years perhaps you will look at it differently i know i have expierence that with other works by different authors all in all , recommend this one highly
i first read this book at about age 12 that period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man 's best friend , so i was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup , took his dog , and drove around the united states it did n't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an old guy he shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill you want to grab a sleeping bag , some grub , and hit the road at that time , i was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in steinbeck 's camper it would be a few years before i saw the movies of mice and men and the grapes of wrath , which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who john steinbeck was and what he was about in travels with charley the reader does n't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of steinbeck 's fiction in this book steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man , like andy rooney now that i'm getting kind of old myself , i find myself experiencing the changes in the world steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book when he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer , you get the willies along with steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea , manned by the very young , protecting us , yet at the same time menacing the first time i read his description of the waitress in the diner in maine , so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy , i had never met that kind of person before since then i have worked with many just like her my favorite part was when steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in maine also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous top 40 songs on the radio , last generation 's castoffs as today 's antiques , and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place steinbeck got road weary halfway through the book , his dog got sick , and everything seemed wrong he witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s the badlands and the south creeped him out , and he could n't wait to get back home is n't that just the way a real trip works \?
i love steinbeck , so i try to read what ever he has written this book was a total surprise , it is so diferent from his other books i think this would appeal to people who are not steinbeck fans for the loyal reader it is a surprise to see his veiw of a country on the bring of the interstate revolution he observation of trailor park life is great , and i hear you can see the truck that he drove at the steinbeck museum in california
steinbeck 's novels are some of the most powerful statements about american culture available on the planet but who knows the writer \? travels with charley lets readers get to know john steinbeck , how he thinks , what he believes in , all with great wit and intimacy steinbeck is a very funny man i even learned a new respect for poodles what else could you want in a book
this is one of the best , most enjoyable books ever written , in my opinion it is a combination history \( of a now by gone america \) , essay \( on what it means to be american , on the coming modern world , on racism , on travel , even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking \) , memoir , history , travelogue and poem steinbeck sets off with his dog charley in a glorified pickup truck to see america in 1960 he explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states he meets people , he offers opinions , he converses with his pal charley , and he offers a comment on america past , present , and future i find this a fascinating , thoroughly enjoyable \( and i 'd even say classic \) read and i would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on america and travel with charley and the great author who drove him around for those familiar with john steinbeck only as a writer of fiction , this book reveals a new side , and one i think you will enjoy
wish i had bought this book first ! bobbi brinker tells it like it really is and does n't sugar coat anything this book was most instrumental in helping me decide to have an african grey congo in my life
this is truly an outstanding book the author is a bird whisperer , having great insight into dealing with parrots , as the special intelligent and talented beings they are so many interesting suggestions on all aspects of a parrot 's life i'm very grateful to bobbi brinker
this book is a must for new owners of greys
i have learned so much with this book i recomend it highly to any who gets a gray
this book has good information for feeding and care of african grey parrots i wish there had been more on training , however the breeding sections are excellent
the title for my review says it all brinker 's years of experience in raising and living with these wonderful creatures comes through in this gently and lovingly written book her approach to handling african greys is very well known in the avian community she has taken great pains to study their nutritional and medical needs , along with how to raise babies to give them the best start in life whether you are new to african grey parrots or are a seasoned owner , this book is an excellent species specific reference for anyone who is captivated by these magnificent birds i even bought a copy for my avian vet , who appreciated it very much
most people who have an african grey parrot and are on the internet have heard about bobbi brinker her birds are commonly called bobbi babies by those fortunate enough to have one of her babies
this book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots it devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human however , i feel that the book falls short on several aspects , and i found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section i thought i would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index ! as such , the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots for the 20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index having some experience with other parrots and with other books , i find the book lacking and plain
this book has alot of information if you are purchasing or thinking of purchasing a baby grey ! ! i have been looking up alot of information daily with my new baby even though i have owned another grey for 5 years
although i have been a registered nurse for over 20 years , i am new to the field of hospice nursing final gifts , written by experienced hospice nurses , provided me with an insight into their world that only first hand knowlege can give this is a must read for anyone who deals with death on a regular basis there is a need for a special awareness in order to receive the final gift that a dying person wants to share
this book was recommended to me by the cancer support group i was going to unfortunately , my father died the next day i wish everyone in my family , especially my parents , had read it before my father died much of what was going on with him would have been more understandable
i think i 've now bought 6 copies of this book , for my own library , to lend to people who are interested and might benefit , and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering hospice , or their grieving families after a loved one 's death
this book was reoommended by a friend who read it when her husband was dying he had read it also and found it very helpful to understand the process he was going through and he highly recommended it and that says something ! when my mom was passing i read it and although i was scared to read it , it actually was nothing to fear it was comforting and enlightening and made the process much easier for me as the caretaker and daughter i recognized and understood the things she was saying much better and knew how to respond in some unusual circumstances i recommend this book to anyone dealing with the process of dying i bought extra copies to give to others who are losing someone close to them
i wanted to do some hospice volunteering but was so worried during the training that i was not made for this kind of work as i am a pretty emotional sort but during my training it was suggested that i read final gifts to help ease some of my fears it was the best thing i could have done , though it is never easy to lose a patient it sure opened my eyes to near death awareness and the needs of those leaving this world i highly recommend this book for anyone one who is losing a loved one one who would like to work with those dying or just one with questions of the end of life process i thank both authors from the bottom of my heart for this book
this book was recommended to my family after my mother received a terminal diagnosis we all read it and i cannot begin to tell you what a help this book was during my mothers final journey not only did it help us , it allowed us to help her if you or someone you know is dealing with the terminal diagnosis of a family member or friend please read or give them this book
i highly recommend this book for anyone who is going through the painful experience of a loved one 's dying process there are many stories and guidelines for making their transition from life to death a more comfortable and valuable experience , and will also help you to cope better
in short , this was an incredible insight on the process of dying and was very helpful in understanding some of the mood changes and actions of my dying mother
final gifts is a very special book it is a guide for those who have never witnessed the death of a loved one or someone who is approaching death the authors are exquisitely sensitive to the needs of the dying the book is a vehicle for enabling the grieving living and dying to come to terms with fate and appreciate the wonders of life 's final journey although not esposing religion , the experiences expressed have considerable spiritual content it is a book one can read quickly , or as i preferred , to read in sections , contemplate , and read on
great help for me as i teach end of live car
read this book ! you do n't have to be a transsexual , homosexual , male , or female to get a lot out of this book i'm a married heterosexual female and read this book with an open mind , and am so glad i did so kholsa 's transition from a female body to a male one that matched his male brain offers insights on the societal and biological constructs of gender and how our bodies are hard wired to think and behave in certain ways by our hormones , our sociology , and so many other things the fact that kholsa has experienced both sides can help you learn more about yourself and the opposite sex than you ever thought possible
this is much more than a story about a man born in a woman 's body who then went through life threatening surgery and alot of sole searching to become the person he is today it is also a study in determination and perserverance i saw dhillon khosla on the view and immediately bought his book i could not believe that he was born a woman when i received his book i read it through in one night \( something new for me \) because i had to know the whole story while this book will interest those who feel they too are trapped in the wrong body , it is also the story of an incredible journey full of sandtraps and brick walls the intimate story is told with intellectual honesty and is an excellent read
both sides now one man 's journey through womanhood by dhillon khosla takes you along with him on a journey no mere mortal could
it 's an intellectual book with alot of funny anecdotes it provides insight as to a person 's emotional and spiritual evolvement the books speaks about many dreams during this transition it seems to me that dhillon was so determined to become his real person that the lines between the physical world and the dream world began to blend it also demonstrates how this person grew spiritually i mostly appreciated how he kept a kind heart during some very difficult times
this is the first book that has profoundly moved me in so many ways it has inspired me beyond what i thought a book ever could
i have recently finished this disaster of a novel for a college honors course disability through autobiography while attempting to read this book , my frustration took over and in a couple of instances , resulted in the book being thrown across the room much of the book seems a criticism of those that are not blind as well as the depictions of the blind by those who are not blind , namely authors and hollywood directors i can think of a much better topic for a book than nit picking at random quotes in movies , books , and social groups kleege seems to only show the ability for a blind person to criticize those who are not blind and may not completely understand what blindness is although i have taken many courses that focus intensely on accepting those with disablilities in society , i find it very difficult to accept severe cynicism no matter what disability the author may have
like many people who have read this book , i am legally blind it was recommended to me by a friend who has very good vision comparing notes with her was particularly educational the perspectives of a sighted person and a blind person on the text turn out to be not all that different
dr howard g hendricks is a master teacher , and this book is a summary of what might be his most life changing class a class on how to study the bible on your own ! i had the privilege of taking that class i highly recommend this book to anyone who wants the joy of personal discovery if you want to be able to open the bible and discover what it means and what it means to you , then this book is one that can get you to that point !
everything i have seen from dr hendricks is good , but this was especially good ! he does a great job or explaining why to study the bible , then a number of strategies to get much more from your own study
this book is an excellent tool for learning to study the bible on your own author , howard hendricks , is a professor at dallas theological seminary , but his writing is understandable and easy to read each chapter helps you to dig deep into the meanings of the bible passages and apply them to your own life
howard hendricks is one of the best bible teacher i have come acrossed he is a motivational teacher , his teaching is fruitful and productive , and mostly importantly changed life he is a gift from god
this is an excellent resource on personal bible study it 's format is easy for the novice and useful for those who are a little more experienced
this book is not only chalk full of wonderful knowledge on how to read your bible , it is also gives you some great basic biblical advice if you are often overcome with the thought of reading a book older than dirt , than this is a book to finger through to help you get a better handle on it a book well worth the read
great book easy to read , step by step applications i have a new outlook on the bible as a treasure to dig into
this is an easy reading book , in 45 fun little chapters , to help people gain the basic biblical interpretation skills they need to transform their lives the hendricks' show us how proper interpretation of scripture is used to fuel our minds for improved prayer meditation based on god 's principles these principles are to be applied in our daily lives to change us and consequently change our corner of the world the overall approach is the same used by most bible study methods that is , inductive bible study observe , interpret , apply
this is probably the most important book to get christians to read more important than the bible \? yes because reading this will 1 \) get people excited about getting into the bible and 2 \) give them the tools to get the most out of their time in the bible
think and grow rich is a classic after reading and listening to hundreds of audio books in this subject , napoleon hill set the foundation for a philosophy that empowers people towards their greatness
i carry this book with me too work all the time to remind me and give me inspiration to strive for more and never quit in reaching my financial goals
this is a great book , but you have to read it with the idea in mind that it was something like a million years ago when it was written \( ok maybe not that long ago \) i have this in my library because it is an essential piece for any person who like me want to venture out in the unknown waters of \( gasp \) aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh self employment gotta think everyday and while your at it read this too use your common sense of course but read it
the single most helpful book in changing the way i thought about myself and my goals buy it
napoleon hill 's gift to each of us who reads and rereads this astounding life recipe is priceless i remain in awe of his rigour , insight and persistence if you have n't read this book , buy it now , read it and read it again then do hill 's exercises exactly as he advises and the world will shift beneath your feet
the title of this book is actually quite deceiving , because even though the author focuses on the link between thought and financial success , his principals can be utilized in all areas of life i have studied the ancient texts of the vedas and upanishads and have found a strong link between the work of napoleon hill and this ancient philosophy on the power of thought
quantum physicians have started to realise a simple truth we are in charge of our lives and it is us who totally create our reality anything is possible only as long as we can imagine it and if we have the will to do anything required to get what we want , we will get it this is a very powerful message and it made andrew carnegie one of the richest men on the planet \( who later inspired walt disney 's uncle scrooge \) nobody says that getting rich is easy , or that any other undertaking that you may have is however , you have the key to your own success in your own hand , whatever it is that you may wish for
napoleon hill , author of this 1920s classic , will remind you of an older , wiser , slightly wacky uncle who advises you about careers , life and love this book is a wonderful collection of tips many based on the ideas of hill 's mentor andrew carnegie that range from the practical \( how to prepare a resume \) to surprisingly new age like mystical talk about the infinite powers of the universe of course , like an old uncle , hill can get long winded and repetitive at times , but since he packs so much wisdom into his slender book , you will want to reread it over and over again , repetitions and all we recommend his classic compendium to everyone who is dangling from the career ladder and wondering how to prosper

a bend in the road is by far my favorite spark 's novel it balances mystery , romance , and suspense perfectly to keep the reader interested at all times i adored the main characters , and could relate to them easily you will laugh , cry , and your heart will be warmed i read through a bend in the road in one sitting i suggest you do the same
this was an excellent book this is the book that got me hooked on nicholas sparks
i love nicholas sparks' books like all his books they are an easy read just cuddle up on the sofa and begin as always he mixes tragic and love this one is especially sweet with a child who lost his mom , and his dad finding new love there are twist and turns in the book and some are sad you wo n't be dissappointed
i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver , i knew the rest of the story it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing the story 's decent the text flows nicely , and the suspension of disbelief is strong , but where did nick 's originality go \? where 's the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook , a walk to remember , and nights in rodanthe \? it seems like he 's run out of steam , or did n't care too much about this one
the concept of this book could 've worked , but sparks did n't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track it 's painfully obvious who is driving the car the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying , as is their relationship interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms and the ending to the story is laughable i wo n't give it away , but i'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages i doubt i can read another sparks novel again
i absolutely love all of nicholas sparks' books i have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you get your kleenex 's ready you ca n't go wrong here
i read the review from the reviewer who had figured out who did it halfway through the book yes , i suspected who did it also but , there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out , etc it seemed like a hopeless situation when i realized the perpetrator i listened to the audio version of this book i usually only listen to audio books as i walk however , when i got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was , i could n't stop listening i listened to the last two cassettes non stop all morning long if i had been reading it , it would have been a true page turner until i reached the end i recommend this story highly it is different than the notebook and the wedding , and i applaud nicholas sparks as a writer
a bend in the road is another one of my favorite books of nicholas sparks miles was not very forgiving to sarah 's brother when he told him the truth he could have kept the relationship going sarah was a good person and i good teacher i would like to read that book again
a bend in the road takes the reader on a journey that encounters heartbreak and sorrow , and ends with a chilling twist that is guaranteed to leave the reader smiling and teary eyed
i have a hard time understanding what it is that i dislike about the novel i dislike it almost as much as the movie
john le carr has written a touching spy thriller that traces the transformation of a man who loses his wife to a diabolical intrigue , and sets out to discover who is responsible the suspects are multinational pharmaceutical companies as le carr puts it in his epilogue it is about individual conscience in conflict with corporate greed
i am a long time fan of le carre have read and loved all his books until this one i just could not summon the interest to finish it yes , i'm sort of curious about why this guy 's wife was killed , but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there i was on vacation and had nothing else to do , yet still , i could not wade through this mind numbing book i got about half way through did i quit reading too soon \? did it suddenly pick up after that \?
deserving of all accolades it 's gotten , and deserving of more than one oscar nomination heartbreaking in the same way that hotel rwanda was
justin quayle is a diplomat with the british high commission in nairobi a mild man who loves gardening , quayle is devastated when he hears that his beloved , much younger wife tessa has been brutally murdered while attending a conference with her companion , african dr arnold bluhm rumors are rampant and deal with everything from the relationship between tessa and bluhm to the the reason for her murder justin emerges from the paralysis of mourning and decides that his goal is to throw himself into the task of tracking tessa 's quest for human rights in nairobi and thus finding out the motive for murder as he tries to duplicate tessa 's movements during her final days , justin discovers that her efforts had been directed at a large drug company which is unethically testing drugs on poor africans who have contracted tuberculosis le carre takes the reader through a seemingly unending series of interviews and manipulations between justin , the pharmaceutical company and the diplomatic corps the same effect could have been achieved in many fewer pages , but the story remains a haunting and interesting one
i am a sucker for a story in a foreign country lecarre is an great writer , and made the african scene very realistic he paints a very clear political picture of kenya that is probably not far from the real political situation in many african nations as a missionary in a third world country , i can understand how paternalism and racism sneaks into foreigner 's minds the western characters in constant gardener exhibit extreme paternalistic attitudes toward africa and though ugly and obviously wrong , many foreigners use these attitudes to deal with their own culture shock the hero of the story had no problem bonding with the people , which is probably the reason for her healthy attitude when foreigners spend time and build relationships with the people of the country , they will bond with these people and begin seeing them for what they are equals but the majority of the characters in this book spend their time in their western homes , only seeing nationals who are servants are these westerners bad people \? probably not but they have succumbed to paternalism and racism because of their lack of contact and relationships with the people
no one has captured in evocative , mesmerizing prose the secret world of spies and diplomacy as brilliantly and as well as british author and former spy himself john le carre in recent years he has turned his attention away from classic cold war plots of espionage skullduggery for which he is best known in his george smiley series of novels , to take on other , equally important , issues such as food and medical aid to developing countries in the constant gardener le carre offers one of his most exciting novels to date , while posing some intriguing ethical questions for which there are no easy answers these include whether the west has a moral obligation to give corrupt third world governments substantial financial , medical and food assistance knowing that most of this aid will never reach those for which it is intended he also raises the issue whether the third world should serve the west as inexpensive sites for clinical trials of potential drugs which are harmful to patients who are unwilling participants in these trials , in the expectation that these drugs , once perfected , will be quite successful in curing the illnesses for which they are designed
i am a huge fan of john le carre he could write anything and i 'd be hooked there is no one better at describing the nuances of a character 's persona and i especially like how he has had the flexibility and talent to evolve from a fifties and sixties cold warrior to a modern day master , with relevant subjects such as with this one , big drug companies screwing poor africa but i found this book to run long , and some of the middle passages , which are a paper trail investigation , not to be compelling there 's a lot of faux newspaper reports that justin quayle \( the ralph fienes character \) wades through , and an endless interrogation by two one dimensional police officers who just about disappear later on at the end of a story , le carre likes to rid us of his main character if you 're the protagonist in one of his books chances are you 're bound to wind up dead no sequels for you it was true with the spy who came in from the cold , it was true for absolute friends , it was true in the looking glass war , and it 's true here no happy endings for them if you want a better read , with the same infused characterizations of the title , try the tailor of panama , funny , crazy and a book that could still have a sequel
john le carre has been writing suspense , espionage , and mystery novels for more than 40 years now i read the first few of them when i was in high school \( say 30 years ago \) and enjoyed them , mostly for the odd characters that the author peopled his books with over the years , he 's written everything from straight spy novels \( tinker , tailor , soldier , spy , the spy who came in from the cold and smiley 's people \) around to more romantic spy novels \( the russia house \) , comic versions of the spy novel \( the tailor of panama \) and even attempted serious straight fiction \( the largely unsuccessful the naive and sentimental lover \) many of the previous books are more cheerful , or eccentric stories , so it 's important for the purposes of this review to remember what first got le carre attention the spy who came in from the cold , which was published basically at the same time as the james bond movies , and which featured a rather drab , mundane spy who actually failed to fulfill his mission , and \( i'm going to give away the plot here \) actually gets killed at the end of the book failing to save the girl if you keep that in mind , when i tell you that the current book is about a pharmaceutical multinational corporation and one man 's challenge to it , you 'll have an idea what the book is like
i wo n't delve into the plot of this novel , as i'm sure other reviewers have covered it and i wo n't comment upon the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry or the african plight , though they are certainly comment worthy and beautifully shown instead , i 'll tell you why i found this novel unique it emotionally devastated me
i really enjoyed this one as i do most of patterson 's work
i greatly enjoyed this book it is not the best one written by james patterson but it was very good i would recommend it
it was an easy read and went quick i liked the big font and short chapters
i enjoy reading james patterson 's books , and this one was no different i highly recommend it
james comes through again a real page turner andrew gross picked a winner to collab with
i wont go over plot or characters because you can get that in other reviews , what i will say is this book is a great read i finished this one in about 5hrs , i did not want to put it down patterson has a great knack for characters and real dialogue between the characters nothing is too overtop or unreal in this story
palm beach lifeguard ned kelly has the perfect life then he meets seductive and very beautiful tess mcauliffe they go out and she 's the one as far as he 's concerned , however she 's tres classy and lives way above his lifestyle so he decides to throw in with four childhood friends , mickey , bobby , dee and barney , who have come up with a nice little score that will set them up for life
i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away , it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places , like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world
i really liked this book , it was a great fast read the only thing was the main character was very emotional , a little more than i'm used to in a male character , he seemed to cried a lot other than that i thoroughly enjoyed it
life guard satisfied my desire to be entertained as well as to stimulate my intellect this novel really does cover the gamut exhilarating action , stunning twists , genuine love , beautiful settings , ethical dilemmas , desire for riches , mysterious murders , detective investigations , false accusations , and self vindication yet somehow , it emerges as neither contrived nor unbelievable
i was very interested in this product when i read the description however , after recieving the product was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar if you have any sense of intergrity ignore this product the author must me one of the biggest decievers out there to put such effort in this product
this man obviously knows nothing about human behavior most people know that just because someone ca n't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest in more cases than not , they simply have low self esteem are very self conscious , and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or i might do when asked to do improv this man himself is a manipulator , and a liar he 's manipulating you to get this book , taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience lying and hypnotizing people in order to get the truth out of them , is far less effective than being honest yourself if you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars you will start to have an understanding of people 's energies if you just pay attention
okay , the title is misleading in that reading this book does n't mean you wo n't be lied to , it simple means that you will be able to notice when you have been lied to , and the book gives some great tools in learning how to redirect the conversation in order to get at the truth
i bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation i feel that most of what i read is simply not factual as a person , i feel strongly that i would not want to tell anyone that i knew the author or was his friend maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience
i like this book as it offers you advice on what to look for
find out what it means when someone turns their back to you while you are talking to them find out what it means when someone walks near the door when you are talking to them find out what it means when someone picks something up and puts it between you and them while you are talking to them find out the hidden meanings highly recommended full of lots of useful information that each and everyone can benefit from
this book was a great help to me in being able to detect when people are lying it shows you how to look at eye contact , pauses in speech , and unneccesary details people put into lies that they do not put into regular conversation i have used these techniques for years
this book is an utterly corrupt , crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them , to live under a constant cloud of suspicion , and to essentially ruin your personal relationships shall i give you an example \? from page 122 you and a friend are deciding on what movie to see you suggest 'lost in paradise' , but your friend , who does n't want to see this , offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and did n't like it you then say 'oh , well , if no one in your office liked it , i guess it 's probably no good ' if she lets it go at that not correcting you then you know she lied initially \( emphasis mine \) excuse me \? what kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a liar because she does n't want to see a movie \? a little earlier , a technique called insert a false fact shows up insert a false fact \? is n't that known as lying \? and this in the context of a party , no less hoo boy start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars you 're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick if you just tell the truth , you 'll be amazed at the nice people you meet who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation \? trust me , if you have a moral compass , you do n't need this rag
very in depth review of kinesics and verbal wrangeling i have been studying this for years and learned some new things with this book i would highly recommend it to folks involved in interview and interrogation fields
having just finished this book , and having identified with many of the situations that russel , the main character faces , i feel very moved the book is a page turner i'm so glad that books like this exist for teenagers , especially gay teenagers and for 40 somethings like myself , who still struggle with what do people think issues i certainly learned something from this book , and enjoyed the process as well
i am a 17 year gay guy from ohio and let me say , this is one of the best books i 've read in a long time i felt and feel like i am the character of russell in the book , i 've gone through so many of the things he has i even cried after reading the sequel after this one because it made me look at my own situation and how hard it is to be gay and love someone who might never talk to you again if they knew i feel like this book deserves several awards , it certainly had a touch to me
boring and irritating not one character is likable , and not one character is 3d
geography club by brent hartinger is the story of russell middlebrook , a gay 16 year old , who is negotiating the dog eat dog world of high school popularity he is also firmly and solidly in the closet at the beginning of this book and over the course of the novel the reader explores the pitfalls , dangers , and excitements of being a high schooler and being gay hartinger locates russell 's' story in the social borderlands he is not super popular nor is he reviled , and he is smart and snarky , but very insecure when rumors of a gay kid and a gay club start to swirl at goodkind high , russell is finally starting to feel good about himself and rise up the popularity ranks thanks to the influence of his closeted jock boyfriend this leaves russell to make difficult decisions that will resonate with any reader who feels or felt like an outsider in high school
russel middlebrook is pretty sure that he 's gay after all , he 's not attracted to girls , and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half naked guys in the locker room he 's never had an actual experience with another guy , though , so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he 'll outgrow or maybe not
brent hartinger \( the author of geography club \) here i wanted to respond to the previous reviewer i really am sorry you found my book boring i admit that 's not a criticism i 've heard before \( and i thought i 'd heard it all about this book that it 's inappropriate for teenagers , that it 's too realistic , that it 's not realistic enough , that it 's too mainstream , that it 's not mainstream enough , etc , etc \) if anything , people usually say there 's almost too much going on , or that the book moved so quickly , they wanted it to be longer
brent offers a money back guarantee at his events , where he would give a reader a dollar if they came up with his book and told them it was boring
well written with good plot and likeable characters author has an excellent understanding of teenage angst
seriously i love this guy russel middlebrook , in these two books i'm actually kinda bummed that he 's a character in a book , so he does n't really exist cause he sure works for me
nft chicago is the one book to carry around in your backpack as you cruise the city but pay attention to the title it really is not for tourists
uptown , oldtown , gold coast , north side sometimes it seems like chicagoland has another name for every area this book is great just what i needed to explore the areas of chicago it 's organised by areas and lists all of the different things from restaurants to theatres to laundry mats in the area the maps are very clear and easy to read excellent book for people who 've just moved to chicago \( and are n't after the touristy things \) i think it 's equally useful for people who live in the 'burbs and downtown dwellers highly recommended
explain this to me why is the actual size of the chicago nft larger than the nyc one \? the one i have for nyc is small enough to fit in my pocket but the chicago version is just larger too big to easily carry in a pocket \( but it fits in a bag just fine \)
this was my bible when i moved to chicago 2 years ago it has both practical information \( such as video stores , post offices , bus and train routes \) on detailed neighborhood maps , as well as shopping and cuisine listings i used it , and recommend it , constantly it was far more helpful than any other city guide i tried , and over time , i knew the city well enough to put it away ! and that 's when you 're really not a tourist anymore
outside of a few typos , i found the 2005 edition of nft chicago to be more useful than past ones \( which were also useful \) the main thing is , there 's a lot more maps instead of just having central chicago covered , it goes all the way to the city 's borders , so it 's great when i have to go way south or way west , or other areas i do n't venture in very much also , it seems like thier arts listings are more comprehensive , and there 's a huge new section about what to do with kids \( although it seems to be targeted to the nanny set \) still , it 's an invaluable refernce to have in your car , or to hand off to guests if you have to leave them to thier own devices
my boyfriend and i recently moved the the city both of us had visited chicago multiple times and knew the very basics but realized we needed more guidance in navigating the streets and making our way through the maze of information we were finding online regarding apartments and neighborhoods the not for tourists guide was the best investment we have made since deciding to move \( excluding the fantastic bucktown loft we ended up choosing \) although the simple , and usually cheesy , neighborhood descriptions leave something to be desired , this guide was extremely helpful in figuring out the basics of each area of the city when searching for places to live , it was great to be able to pinpoint the location on the clear and detailed maps and know exactly how far each prospective home was from grocery stores , banks , shops , restaurants and l stops \( of course nothing was more valuable than actually seeing the neighborhoods for which the nft guide was extrememly helpful while plotting our route \) we still keep the guide within reach while exploring new parts of the city and it has saved us multiple times while trying to find alternate routes around crazy traffic flow
this guide is honestly , pretty useless any tom , dick or harry knows about wrigleyville , boystown , and well , the rest of lakeview anyone can tell you that the heart of lincoln park is , well , lincoln avenue but , why , for the life of me , ca n't i find much on bridgeport \? mayor daley liked it well enough , but , hey , the nft guys ca n't be bothered with the facts where 's anything west of western \? i guess humboldt park and albany park are n't worth the time which is too bad , because it completely leaves out mention of some of the best bars and music clubs in the city , not to mention , some of the easiest to navigate streets if you 're a tourist looking for lowest common denominator style travel books , then yes , i guess the nft is a little better than average but when i saw how useless this thing was when a freshly moved in friend bought one , i knew that this is for tourists and tourists only you 're better off with the irreverent guide heck , they might actually list an address for the empty bottle
this helpful guide includes lots and lots of maps for tons of neighborhoods , as well as other useful information recommended for people relocating to chicago , suburbanites who have reasons to come into the city every once in a while , or locals who just want to get to know other parts of the city better
i really , really enjoyed this book it is fascinating illuminating a period often brushed past by other histories giving people and events their due it also does a wonderful job of updating \( and or refuting \) earlier theories of why the western half of the roman empire fell heather 's writing style makes for a good read he knows his stuff and presents his evidence in an authoratative way that does n't come across as stuffy the writing flows in a way that make this work a real page turner i think readers interested in this period or rome in general would enjoy this book and while it certainly feels like a work that would hold its own with a serious student of history , a more general reader would hopefully enjoy it as much as i have
this is history as history should be written by turns witty , incisive , and far reaching , heather draws on his broad reservoirs of knowledge of not only of the barbarians and rome , but also of modern one party states and economics surprisingly relevant topics i very much appreciated how heather gave context to the motivations of the sources he quoted , taking nothing at face value and wittily translating the sense of old quotes so that the modern reader could understand them
notice the title of peter heather 's fascinating study of the final centuries of the roman empire it is a clear tribute to gibbons , yet the decline is intentionally missing because according to dr heather the roman empire never declined its fall was due to external , rather then internal , forces , and the perpetrators were two the huns and the goths
this book discusses the last hundred years of the western roman empire to its fall having read many of the reviewers here , i do n't think its worth while repeating the writer arguements so i will report my thoughts

this magnificent book is accessible to the history buff or general reader and provides an extensive , logical and easy to read account of all that went wrong in the last hundred years of the western roman empire mr heather 's extensive research combined with attention to detail has produced a brilliant , well argued revisionist account of why the empire eventually fell to the barbarians
peter heather 's the fall of the roman empire is an exciting book because it peels away the pasted on theories of the fall of the roman empire and replaces them with a logical , coherent theory of what happened for some reason , known only to my shrink , i am a fan of the roman empire and so , while reading the fall of the roman empire , i kept rooting for the romans to win , hoping that the conclusion might turn out differently and the empire would survive but , alas , it did not still , it 's that kind of book it reads like a novel , with clear , easy to read prose the next time you travel to hungary think of attila the hun whose fierce , stretched skull huns , wielding deadly bows that could pierce armor from horseback a hundred plus yards distant , smacked into the germanic tribes to the west and sent them carooming like billiard balls across the roman frontier i wo n't spoil any more of the plot for you because this well researched and entertaining book deserves your full ruminations \( there are 16 maps and the many footnotes are tucked away in the end papers , out of sight \) the fall is a no brainer , five star , read it now narrative that makes the political , economic , military and social aspects of the fourth and fifth centuries seem like they happened yesterday , and that the romans of these times , whose orderly world was slowly unraveling into a kind of chaotic darkness , were people much like you and i , struggling to save their way of life in vexing , dangerous times
it 's quite difficult to write a comprehensive and understandable narrative of the years leading up to the end of the roman empire in the west because of the paucity of contemporary sources , and the potential inaccuracy of those sources from folowing centuries this author has taken what he feels are the accurate parts of the sources available , and combined them with the best of historical roman scholarship , and written a book that covers the years involved , and covers them quite well often histories of the distant past tend to be difficult to comprehend to the average reader , but this book keeps the knowledge level just about perfect you will learn more about the last years of the western empire than you probably knew before , and you will learn in an easy to understand manner the author makes the past come alive , and that 's what good histporical writing is all about
the fall of the roman empire a new history of rome and the barbarians , by peter heather
there is no getting away from the noun 'mind' it is perfectly intelligible and sensible to say that newton , hume and richard bentley had fine minds however we soon get into a muddle when we misunderstand what kind of noun 'mind' is people possess certain capacities that we call 'mental' by way of distinguishing them from capacities of the senses such as eyesight , or from capacities of the physique like weight lifting , and anything that is `mental' is of the mind and immediately we have to watch our step if we want to think clearly bentley , bentley 's eyes and bentley 's eyesight can each be said to have had the capacity to read the text of manilius bentley and bentley 's eyes \( but not bentley 's eyesight \) can each be said to have read manilius however what enabled bentley to correct and edit the text of manilius was his mind , but bentley 's mind did n't edit manilius , bentley did
gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor on page 16 , he writes a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries , department buildings , and museums then he asks but where is the university \? this is the category mistake cartesian question where is the mind \? has a same confusion , he asserts
gilbert ryle wrote this classic exposition on the mind body problem in philosophy with a view to dissipate a myth fundamental to religion and philosophy his cogent exposition leads us to see mind in persons as other than a ghost in a machine more than this , though , his comprehensive scrutiny of the many elements of the life of the mind constitutes an incisive study of the synergy of mind and body in an integrated life ryle exercises consummate skill in avoiding technical jargon to present a refreshing style for treatment of a difficult and elusive subject one of his favorite analogies is to compare a study of thinking as like trying to catch a jellyfish with a fine hook a thoughtful and careful reader will revel in ryle 's success with his daunting task
in a sense , this book is a mirror to the problems covered in wittgenstein 's philosophical investigations albeit with tighter arguments and far less meandering than wittgenstein 's groundbreaking work \( this was published three years before wittgenstein 's posthumous pi \) both men were dedicated to freeing philosophy from what ryle terms category errors misapplications of the ordinary referential scope of a given term \( mind as a concept which must necessarily oppose substance for instance this duality forces us to ascribe and essentialize qualities to the incorporeal along the same lines as that of substance , by giving it attributes on the linguistic model of physical objects \) these misapplications have led philosophers into vast problems which , by their very nature as linguistic misuses , are unsolvable \( but not dis solvable \) parts of it will provoke cries of behaviorism ! , but ryle included a chapter near the end distancing his stance from skinner et al \( how well he manages in this is debatable ! \) brilliant , straightforward , and elegant , this is one the best works of 20th century philosophy
the concept of mind is a great book for several reasons the main reason to me is that ryle clarifies the concept of being human , while he uses language in a natural way in stead of constructing concepts based on \( for example scientific \) assumptions , he shows what we already see as obvious , just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language he is far from reductionistic mark the subtle irony 'man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine he might , after all , be a sort of animal , namely , a higher mammal there has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man
this book was very well written its gives another look into the life of being hiv positive and makes you understand the emotional side of a person dealing with sickness and still have enought strength to love others
i read this book in about 6 hours it is an easy , if predictable , read does n't delve into the whole aids topic too deeply , but it is always a thread throughout ava is a likeable character , as is her sister the romance sub plot is very predictable , but enjoyable nonetheless
i stayed home from work yesterday because i wanted to read this book undisturbed and i knew that if i would have went to work , i would have done nothing but shut my door and read the book all day so i took the day off \( paid of course \) to read this book and it was well worth it ! ! i was getting my hair done and asked her to keep me under the dryer as long as possible because i wanted to sit there and read and read
i thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end very relatable drama the characters felt real and i did n't want the book to end not one wasted page on pointless details loved it
what looks like crazy on an ordinary day by pearl cleage
i was given this book by a friend as a going away gift the day i decided to read it , i was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting i was a bit drowsy , but i could not but it down it made me nervous , excited , sad , and happy all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
it has been awhile since i read this book , but i remember it being an enjoyable read
had to stop about 1 4 of the way through it and give it away
as a white man , this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it if an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published ! i am tired of the double standard ! thank god i did n't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library
polk 's useful analysis of iraq history brims with insights into what is happening in iraq today this book is a must read for the informed layperson who wants to better understand this critical theater of american interests this is also one of the books that civilian and military policy makers should have read before invading iraq
finally , after reading this book , i feel informed i 've been reading lots of bits and pieces \( articles \) about the history of the middle east and the iraq war and often found it to be somewhat overwhelming understanding iraq really did bring it all together for me i especially appreciated that it was contained in a readable 213 pages now when i see or hear a name associated with the region , i can readily identify that place or person 's role i recognize that a region 's history and politics ca n't be fully described in such a short book but understanding iraq inspires one to explore further and the subject does n't seem so overwhelming anymore it 's an excellent place to start i highly recommend it to average americans who want to be informed
for one who does not know the details of the history of iraq , this book provides an excellent overview dr polk does a good job of explaining rather briefly the panorama of the people who evolved into today 's iraq everyone should read this book along with others about iraq history i look forward to reading the how to get out of iraq co authored by dr polk
i saw dr polk on c span a month or two ago he was addressing a gathering of concerned and apparently well heeled citizens in the new york museum of art as i recall he had the crowd and the moderator in the palm of his hands i found him to be a compelling speaker who obviously was very versed in the subject matter of iraq he seemed to genuinely care about the iraqi people and the amercian people his speech and this book was about correcting our present march of folly to steal from barbara tuchman 's fine book title
many of the amazon reviewers of polk 's book are guilty of being political , a charge that they attempt to tar polk with so when you read the reviews keep in mind that bush apologists can be found everywhere and people of that sort know only too well that should polk 's reasonable and insightful book become popular their cause will be hurt polk 's main contribution is that he has synthesised a highly complex story and made it concise and accessible for the average american for those of us who have worked with us policy abroad , the simple points polk makes about iraq are painful , but true bush and his iraq team would fail economic development 101 as taught by any university in america as polk recounts , there can be no political or economic improvement without good communication \( an occupation army and administration with virtually no arabic language skills is absolutely unthinkable , yet that is the situation we have \) in the long run , top down development absolutely never works \( how could bremer not understand this \? \) local support is a prerequisite for all successful development \( democratic , capitalist development models are unreal ideas to the average iraqi \) and without stable and secure populations and institutions , development plans , capitalist or otherwise , will not be worth the paper they are printed on polk focuses on these basic ideas and presents his case on how and why the united states has ended up in a pickle of bush and chaney 's choosing so unlike the others to be found here , if you must read a book on iraq , pick understanding iraq it is history written from a point of view that strives for simple , telling , damning truth the one thing that political types of all stripes abhor
i was very excited about this book before i started to read it polk appeared to have flawless credentials surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on iraq unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met
not only has this professor studied the country of iraq , he has studied its language and its history unlike many authors writing about iraq , he has lived there he was also a policy advisor during the kennedy administration given this , he has a better perspective than most who have written about it
i honestly do not know why there are n't more reviews on this book or why it 's not one of the top ten best selling books this is definitely one of the most touching and wonderful books i have read this year or ever it is written so beautifully that it makes you feel the characters' pain , love , dreams and hopes evangeline , better known as eva , is a character that will stay with you long after the last page has been turned
impossible to put down ! a book that both inspires and teaches about the human spirit
as a native oklahoman , i found this to be a great book it portrayed small town life very well it was obvious mrs bostwick did her research her portrayal of the hot summers was particularly accurate the characters were real , with flaws and strengths that made them easy to relate to the book was so engaging , i finished it in two days because i wanted to see how it turned out i 'd recommend this book to anyone who likes dorthy garlock , jan karon or philip gulley as a matter of fact , i liked it so well , that i'm buying a copy for a friend 's birthday
luxury for me is reading in bed at night after a long hard day at work this book was so good i had a hard time putting it down , to the point of staying up until the wee hours reading ! just kept thinking one more page and before i knew it , it was 3 00 am ! it was captivating and i loved it never wanted it to end
hope marie bostwick is working on a new book , i am a big fan ! fields of gold is such a multi leveled story with history , drama , romance and the personal triumph of its lead character that it was enjoyable and engrossing in lots of ways
i enjoyed every minute of this book this story of a woman 's path to fulfillment , blended with just the right amount of history , kept me wondering what was factual and what was fiction the perfect book to take on a long car ride or plane trip
from page one to the last , i was drawn into not only the story , but each character this is a sensory exploration into the life of young , innocent woman and her will to overcome adversity the descriptive writing permits one to enter into each scene and become emotionally and physically enveloped by combining a fictional character with one of historical significance , marie bostwick provides readers with the desire to pursue the question 'what if \? ' this book is difficult to put down , inspirational and left me wanting more
i love this story , and every character has specific impact on the life of one strong woman this was definatly a page turner and i never wanted to put it down i ca n't wait for another novel from marie bostwick
i really enjoyed this book it was an easy read and all the characters made their place in this story it was a warm and relaxing book all members of my book club enjoyed it too
i found this to be a fascinating , compelling story i'm a big fan of historical novels and the author did an excellent job of melding the history with the fiction i was very pleased that i noticed no anachronisms because such inaccuracies really jar me out of the suspension of disbelief into which a book has delivered me
after working for a software company for more than 7 years , this book is actually of no surprise to me at all however , those of you who want to know how software projects work in reality , this book is a very good and true reflection of that we probably all studied project management essentials , but all the projects i have been involved in so far , run more like the one described in this book and not like in the school manual enjoy the reality
the setting of the novel are in the fictitious republic of morovia where our lead character ends up somehow
deadline follows the two year fictitious journey of is project manager webster tompkins , illustrating the lessons he learns along the way i bought this book primarily due to the great reviews it garnered on amazon com after all , you ca n't go wrong when a book rates 4 5 out of 5 stars from over 25 readers , can you \? yep this book was terrible , because of two very big problems the book did n't say very much in 300 pages and what it did say i do n't agree with \( it also tends to contradict much of tom peter 's 'in search of excellence' \) or , to state it another way , the book points out about five very useful lessons pieces of information , but takes forever to do so those lessons could have been summarized in about five pages with compelling examples
while i greatly enjoyed demarco 's non fiction books peopleware and slack , i felt this attempt at a novel was weak
this is perhaps the only management novel for it in the vein of the goal by goldratt , tom demarco preaches the gospel of good project management the ideas on staffing , conflict resolution and managing to deadlines are very helpful the challenge is that the novel format could and should provide insight into the conflicts dealing with situations that are not ideal in reality , we are left with great ideas , but a lost opportunity on the difficulties of implementing them
if you think that you can apply tom demarco 's novel knowledge only to the software engineering field , you will get surprised how management is the same across all fields , including software development this is my favorite quote from this book it 's not what you do n't know what kills you , but what you know and is n't so
book catalogues are loaded with titles extolling the benefits and virtues of god belief and religions however , testimonials about atheism are in short supply
this book will hopefully persuade parents to provide an environment for their children that encourages the critical thinking skills that they will sorely need to successfully maneuver through life dr eller contrasts the concepts of knowledge and belief in an enlightening manner i found logic , reason , insight , and humor on every page i highly recommend
i agree with the premises of this book , but found it rather boring , and not the easiest to read if you want to read something similar that does n't read like a textbook , i would suggest losing faith in faith , atheist universe or like rolling uphill
natural atheism covers almost every aspect of atheism in a compendious and lucid manner the chapters of the book are presented in a logical order and address a variety of issues such as what exactly is atheism and why it is the logical conclusion of the critically thinking person , so called different types of atheism , agnosticism , the relationship between science and religion , an atheistic spirituality , and the complex history of separation between church and state the author does n't delve as deeply as possible into the variety of philosophical and scientific reasoning 's that might point to the existence of a creator , but then again , he does n't have to there are other books on the market dedicated to discussing these issues from an atheistic perspective the objective that natural atheism focuses on is the conclusion that atheism is the conclusion of the rational individual and the book does this extremely well eller uses his erudition to demolish a panoply of reasons that a theist might have for believing in a god \( or more accurately , gods \) an atheist will find that this book reaffirms their reasons for becoming \( or staying \) an atheist in the first place the theist will have their opinions , beliefs , and conclusions thoroughly challenged this is not a book that attempts to turn a theist into an atheist by denigrating religion the author shows how religion , every religion , practically begs the believer to question its veracity by simply studying the very idea of religion objectively this book should be read by theists and atheists alike
in addition to being a contribution to clear and unpretentious explanations on the premises of atheism , this book succeeds in identifying several pitfalls created by faulty argumentation eller makes a remarkable distinction between the basis of a belief , which is neither true or false since it is beyond the scope of reason , and a contention presented as fact which requires evidence that can be observed or tested
i bought this book based on the review by david mills , author of atheist universe i bought them both at the same time fully expecting natural atheism to be better , i read mills' book first though natural atheism presents the arguments comprehensibly , i found it less interesting and far more dry than atheist universe i would still recommend it together with atheist universe for a rounded expression of the arguments but i think the points could have been made in simpler language
david eller writes with wit and passion passion is not a word applied by so called mainstreamers to atheists , since they are supposed to be feckless and ignorant david eller shows how this is not so as he passionately , intelligently and articulately lays out the atheistic position
the best book ive read in a long time if you are a little interested in the subject or are already a rationalist atheist , this book is a must have
this book is very , very good dr eller put in an incredible amount of thought and research into each topic that he covers this book is full of very helpful information everything from refuting the arguments for gods existance to a short lesson in logic to a nice summary on the history of the whole church and state thing
a five star book to most westerners , china is a huge enigma and this book sheds light on what is happening in china today most westerners have some idea of the horrors of the cultural revolution but may not understand how it permeated the lives of most of the educated chinese this book tells those stories and how these five classmates of his have fared , and about how new china works today his personal story is also very interesting
this is a must read i just came back from one year in china and his observations are right on the money for the current situation in china he put things clearly , and it is not a difficult read i could n't put it down
this is an excellent book , written by someone who has lived many years in china , married a chinese wife , yet remains objectively concise in analyzing china 's unique approach to business , cultural , and personal relationships as we become ever more intertwined with asian , and especially chinese influences , this book is critical to our understanding and to merging our national interests with china 's interests
pomfret provides insight into china 's cultural revolution through the eyes of his classmates at a chinese university who participated the result of youths gone wild , even abusing their own parents for trivial issues , is bone chilling , almost otherwise unimaginable we also learn of serious discrimination against females during that same time period everyone is encouraged required to report on each other for any form of non conformist behavior
having for many years read and admired pomfret 's excellent articles in the washington post , especially his superb reporting from china , i was not surprised by the quality of the factual content of his book , but was moved by the depth of the author 's ability to portray his classmates characters with understanding and compassion
when john pomfret found the rampant prostitution on his third trip to china in 1990s , he looked back at his observations in early 1980s , and realized that chinese people had been deprived of sexuality for decades under mao women were hiding their gender identity by wearing clothes and making hair fashions similar to man there were no make ups or little decorations like earrings no feminine curves were displayed publicly from back ward or even lateral view it was hard to tell people 's gender difference sexual desires were prohibited to display publicly husband and wives were denied the right of living together when they worked in different locations far apart prostitution were cleansed thoroughly that is where we have come from as one of his roommates , book idiot joe believes we need to know small wonder that when the door suddenly opened to the outside world after mao 's death , sexual suppression rebounded into ubiquitous promiscuity
perhaps the finest correspondent to write on china over the last two decades , john pomfret 's chinese lessons is a penetrating , insightful and frequently moving exploration of the transformations that have remolded much of china only pomfret , whose immersion in china began with his language work at a chinese university , could write this book , a work that traces the lives of student colleagues he met twenty five years ago , and through those lives he elegantly and unsparingly chronicles the cataclysmic change that has swept the country his intimate portraits are stunning in their detail , their passion , and their lessons if there is one book i would recommend on the complexities and landscape of chinese society , it would be pomfret 's superlative effort

i am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the milwaukee public schools system we will use wheatley 's book as the primary resource for our professional growth at our mps middle school principals collaborative institute august 9 11 , 1999 we are not just concerned with reform we seek renewal as well wheatley provides the basis she notes that einstein said that a problem cannot be solved from the same consciousness that created it the entire book is a marvelous exploration of this philosophy
despite that i'm losing a fair chunk of change on kodak in the stock market , and that this book touts kodak film , it remains one of the best all time books for beginner intermediate photographers !
this book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless it tries to be all things to all cameras , and therefore says nothing specific about anything add to this the way it tries to tout kodak film , and you realize kodak should be paying people to read this book but they still would n't know how to work their cameras
if you are a beginner or intermediate photographer , this book will tell you what you need to know to get the results you want in your photography it covers the topics of film , exposure , and flash photography , from the basics to intermediate technique it also has chapters that give advice on specific types of photography action , existing light , and close up there are also chapters on lenses and filters and a short chapter on digital manipulation most of the information in this book would be appropriate for digital as well as film photography if you just bought your first slr , or if you would like to better understand what your camera can do , this is the perfect book for you it also makes a great gift for the young or relatively inexperienced photographer advanced amateurs may find it useful as a refresher or reference to keep for those occasions when you forget some technique that you have n't used in a while but the book 's intended audience is novice to intermediate photographers , and it does a very good job of addressing the needs of those photographers
this is an excellent book , it covers all the topics a beginner photographer should know and should practice with its own camera it brings enough information on each one , including some very useful recommendations about what to do , showing and comparing the resulting photos you can get when using different camera settings in the same purchase order , i bought three similar photographic books , after browsing each one , i liked it best
i like stephen king 's books i have not read them all but i have put a serious dent in the king inventory and believe him to be one of the finest writers of our era his popularity and prolific writing attests to his skill to spin a yarn
hearts in atlantis by stephen king
masterfully thought out written not your usual supernatural , horror king story written in 4 5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural , but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood , follows them through the years culminates with them as adults each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in at the end they are all tied together in some ways years later it 's ingenious in it 's finale and i advise you set aside some time for reading it 's very difficult to put down once it grabs your interest , it just sucks you into the story if you remember your childhood friends \( we all do \) you 'll identify with the story
this is by far my favorite stephen king novel i did not hear any fanfare when it came out but purchased it is a break between the dark tower novels the novel was a surprise in its unique story and depth
i loved the book and bought the cd to listen to while on long drives it 's one of king 's best restrained writings , with no stomch turning descriptions of blood and gore and very little off the wall , meaningless intrusion of aliens which characterize some of his other novels \( dreamcatcher , regulators etc \) the only thing off putting was the extremely poor diction of william hurt he routinely pronounced t 's and d 's as tha , which may come across as laid back in a movie role , but in a reading sounds just plain sloppy i would have given it five stars except for hurt i sincerely hope he is not used in readings again , at least until he receives some speech therapy
this was one of the first stephen king book i have read , i first read it back in 2002 and just got through with it agian and it still moved me just as much as when i first read it it 's hard to explain just how it moved me , i'm not even sure if i know completly
i do n't read much king , or the horror genre but i got this as an audio book and decided to try it out the narrators were quite good and did n't distract you from the story while at the same time , letting you picture the story in your head
what really sets this book apart from many others is the wonderful use of language and image the evocative idea of low men in yellow coats by itself is almost silly and certainly not scary , but as it is repeated with added bits of observation , it becomes ominous
i think that this was a really good book in about the first half of the book , it is the story of bobby and the strange new neighbor that moves into the apartment on the 3rd floor bobby becomes friends with this man , whos name is ted , and starts to notice some somewhat strange things about him , and starts to get a little scared and confused when ted tells him to keep an eye out and alert him right away so that he can leave if he sees the low men in yellow coats the rest of this book is the personal stories of all the important people in bobby 's life each new section in the book tells what happend to bobby 's friends and some of the not so friendly people in his life , and eventuelly tells what happend to bobby himself when he grew up i strongly recommend this book
this book is fantastic just enough fantasy best thing is , the story of these kids' lives would be just as great without the fantasy , but adding it in just made it better absolutely one of the best s k books i 've ever read , and i 've read them all the movie just does n't do the book justice at all
i purchased the digital version of this book for which i totally regret first , the book is bloated and really offers little more than can be viewed free on nist 's website second , the adobe drm \( digital rights manager \) reader wo n't let you make a backup copy and amazon \( i e , their indian customer service reps anyway \) do n't understand either u s fair use copyright laws or customer service thus not only would n't i buy this book i wo n't ever buy another product from amazon ever again
the woo wei is in every line clever and accurate coming back to childhood of adults
i love this book it is n't dogmatic and it does n't so much alter one 's thinking as it does challenge someone to pay attention to the nature of individual perception perception is not as it 's claimed everything but it does go a long way toward shaping how a person views the world , and pooh is simply a master of life what else can you say
i read this book in high school as part of epistemology course it is very easy to understand the basic principles of taoism through the ideas of pooh and his friends i suggest this book for all philospohy students
for those of you who are curious about this book and may be turned off by some of the negative comments , allow me to offer my humble opinion i think that those people who did not like this book or felt it did not explain taoism , just really do n't get the point taoism most certainly is n't something you seek and seek and then get frustrated at not finding , then angry , and then seek and seek taoism seen especially through pooh 's eyes and actions \( or should i say inactions \) comes so near the mark to beginning to understand this ancient philosophy of harmonious existence on earth with the earth , and the duality of all things i highly recommend this book for that open minded , non judgemental , person open to the concept that indeed anything is possible too many of us are so grounded in what we absolutely know to be fact , when in reality anything in this universe is truly possible please explore this book on your path i also highly recommend the companion book to this , the te of piglet , which delves ever more into taoism
i first read this book when i was 19 years old you always think you know who you are at that age , but you still have so much to learn
not since portrait of the artist as a young man have i labored so much to get through a book i finally quit at page 35 , unable to go on a complete non sequitur , stream of consciousness mess , best describes this book why this publication came so highly acclaimed i will never know do yourself a favor if you feel inclined to give it a read , go to your local library the paper and ink has already been wasted , do n't waste your money too a better title would be , the tao of poop
i picked up this book because it seemed so charming the author took the stories and characters of a a milne and juxtaposed them with the taoist teachings of people such as lao tzu
the tao of pooh is a good book as an introduction to taoism the book does not only present taoism in a very simple way the involvement of pooh makes the book very enjoying
i 've been through this book a few times now i admit that pooh seems a good taoist , if i remember my theology classes right i will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator 's tone
i received this unexpectantly i enjoyed this thoroughly i would recommend this to any one who is new to the concept of math and music being related and needing a rather easy and non complex explanation the author diagrams nicely the examples with the explanations i really think this book would be good a text book in either a high school music or math course in the history of the subject thank you to the person who knew me well enough to give this to me i like this book so much that i almost read it cover to cover in one sitting
farb 's basic premise is that american indians have ascended to the heights of culture \( read white culture \) by 400 years of systematic genocide that 's what the book boils down to farb also makes numerous factual errors e g , he says the mandan indians are exitinct umm , no , mr farb , they 're not
i hope this book will be re edited , the prose is wonderful i could n't put it down and without falling into the 'noble savage' trap , farb shows how wonderful life might have been in most amerindian cultures before columbus this book re educates
i feel that all of these books in the series live up to the hpe , and each has continued to become better than the one before it i have read all 12 , and i would recommend the series to anyone
this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point \( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies \) my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter \( and much better writing \) man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
now the story picks up and get 's interesting again the characters that you have grown to know and care about are in a safe house this book is quicker to read and the story moves at a fast pace you ca n't put it down because you want to see what happens next
i have already written a review on the entire left behind series but i think that this book in this series deserves alot of credit for setting the path for the second half of the series this entire series has been one of the most enjoyable reads of my life whether you are a believer or not you can easily find this book to be an enjoyable read
i 've read the reviews that some other people have written , and they say this book is very off topic and has a lot of selfishness in the characters , and that the events taking place in the tribulation do n't happen the way they are supposed to hello people , this is a fiction book i'm not saying the events that the scriptures say will happen are n't going to happen , because the rapture will occur some day i'm saying if tim lahaye and jerry jenkins wrote a story only on the scriptures and no characters or settings or anything in the story , the story would be way shorter and not as suspenseful because when the anti christ gets assassinated , there can be hundreds , maybe thousands of ways that could happen so when you people say everything in this book is a bunch of garbage , remember this is a story
courtesy of ck2s kwips and kritiques
the need for assassins is great the evil keeps cranking up beyond belief as the suspense continues to buld what a book and what a series more please
after the first 11 books , that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense , the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note i can , however , find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to , fail you with their nobleness or lack of guts ! that you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you 're struggling through your live i think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other almost a live force driven by love , that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations !
when we first met the three baudelaire orphans , they were splashing in tide pools along briny beach that is , before their lives took a turn for the worst now , as we meet up with them once again in this twelfth volume , we again see them upon briny beach however , this time things seem as if they are looking up , for they are in the hands of good kit snicket with the pregnant kit in tow , the three baudelaire 's are brought to the denouement hotel a place kept in order by the dewey decimal system the hotel denouement is the last safe place , and within a few days , each and every volunteer will meet up with one another , where they will celebrate the claiming of the sugar bowl over the hands of evil however , with sunny , klaus , and violet disguised as concierges , they soon learn by using their flaneur skills that many of the people lurking around the hallways of the hotel denouement are anything but good in fact , it is while wrapped up in their clever disguises that the three orphans run into various terrible people from their past from the unescapable count olaf , to the treacherous vice principal nero and the oft times brainless justice strauss , to the carnival freaks known as kevin , colette , and hugo with a bit more detective work , and a little help from identical triplets dewey , frank , and ernest , the orphans soon realize that while the upcoming gathering of volunteers is supposed to showcase how good triumphs over evil the hotel is overrun by unkind masterminds who plan on wrecking the celebration now it is up to violet , klaus , and sunny to make a very important decision call off the volunteer gathering , or think up a way to triumph over the evil that has surrounded them ever since the day mr poe informed them of their parents deaths
overflowing with thrills and mysteries , a very long journey to treachery , three orphans , a villain and his cohorts this is what the penultimate peril is all bout this next to last book makes some of the mysteries from the previous volumes clear to the series' avid readers
hello people wake up how many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy \? ! \? this book was horrid ! boring , boring , boring , after the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one ! ! ! ! ! after 12 books its still not over , my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this ! \( and between me and you , what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit \) i dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book , i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book the end if there was a 0 star i would give it ! !
the penultimate peril , as many of you have read , is an action packed comic book like the rest of the story , someone almost dies or is dead , and old characters are back
what a disjointed mess , talk about cashing in on fame all he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book i could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper i was not that enamored with liar 's poker and this book has done it for me with this author it was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good
this is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness lewis' early literary attempts although lewis is a witty , scrutinizing , insightful , and overall entertaining writer , i think this book is highly overpriced most of the topics in this book cover financial business culture issues that date back during the late eighties , so there 's also a bit of historical perspective to it , when lbos were a la mode , donald trump was making headlines , and japan was considered a threat to the us economy and welfare crazy thought go for liar 's poker if you want to read michael lewis , that script is a jewel
highly recommended do n't let the comment about it being dated mislead you while the essays are rooted in their time \( the early 90 's \) their insights are likely to remain ever relevent i especially enjoyed the essay about the changes in the paris stock exchange
though i am not a vogue reader , i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w 's splashes in the tabloids were all about
wonderful , interesting , will sit on my bookcase and will reread agai
a fascinating life a view from the top and it makes one wonder is it worth it
you can tell that the author went to a great deal of trouble
an expose of a power hungry woman that does not give a hoot about civility and compassion riveting in its revelation about anna wintour 's icy personality that even the sun cannot melt ! though it is not an official autobiography , it is well researched and the consistent views given by most 200 interviewees who worked or had contacts with anna directly is good enough to from a sound judgement of anna 's character with a report card of minus 100 for anna 's personality traits ! ! for those who think that an official autobiography would do it more justice , i would say that anna wintour would probably give a very skewed account in her favor that would make it more unofficial than this unauthorised one
this book is ah mazing it gives you all the details on mostly everything you ever wanted to know about anna wintour this book will make you run out to purchase vogue and flip through to the masthead page just to see her name , that , this book verifies , is bigger and bolder than everyone else 's
having worked in several different sectors before arriving in fashion , i can say that there are lawyers , ceos , doctors , etc who are as equally psycho as anna wintour but not too many people would want to read about a neurotic hospital director ! it seems that some people who bought this book are n't even interested in fashion and have no real perspective on vogue magazine if you are n't fascinated by the subject matter , why buy the book \? i have read every us vogue since 1982 , have lived in many european countries and am extremely familiar with other vogues around the world and work in fashion , so i can say with full conviction that anna wintour is very important in her field fashion is a business like any other and it comes down to money she turned uk vogue around then came to ny and turned us vogue around i agree that she is pretty psychotic , but in general , you 're kidding yourself if your think market leaders can be normal who cares if she is a good writer or not \? she doesn't write ! she is a fashion editor and her magazine is the most influential and financially successful in the world every other fashion magazine in the world is based upon what shows up in us vogue whether we like it or not and she does know how to pick interesting writers for her own publication ! do you think most ceos can type their own letters or do market research \? no , they are there to lead and make decisions i love hearing the gossip on her , so this book was fun to read , but i do respect her immensely from a professional point of view appreciate the book for what it is do n't act like your profession \( or colleagues \) are more respectable or holy than the those of the fashion industry and by the way , dressing well is part of the job in fashion would you expect a it professional to not use a computer \? \? \? !
in response to other reviewers , yes , this book does rely heavily on stereotypes of male and female behavior if you find you do n't fit the stereotypes \( and of course not everyone does ! \) , then you 'll need to look for another book but for many \( most \? \) of us , the insights and advice in this book will be very helpful as i read , i was constantly amazed by how much i could see myself and my husband in john gray 's descriptions last night i had my first opportunity to try out his techniques on how to prepare a man to listen and it worked beautifully ! a situation that would certainly have escalated into a hurtful argument was diffused into a calm , brief conversation that left both of us feeling warm and loving toward each other
mars and venus together forever is one of the most ridiculous , stupid books that i have ever had the gross misfortune to read i probably should have expected what i got , considering that mars and venus on a date left me cold , but i read this one anyway because the original mars and venus book had some interesting insights and i'm a sucker for a cheap book
interesting book unfortunately it really plays on stereotypes it does have a few valuable things to say though
i picked up this book , after running into my ex fiance five years after the fact i have been struggling with gender role issues longer than i care to admit i turned 50 this year to my amazement , i learned some things that i ca n't apply to a male female relationship at this time \( i'm not in one \) , but is helping with the most difficult relationship i have with my adopted mother who is my complete opposite i learned that although she is a career woman , she still has a more traditional mindset than i if you are a busy person , and you do n't get the whole book read , the first three chapters may change your life significantly
riveting ! i hated that it had to end marvelous characters , a haunting tragedy and one of those meant for each other relationships that are a hallmark of nora roberts at her best carolina moon is a richly layered , dark and dangerous variation on the cinderella theme it 's also a fine whodunnit with a plot twist worthy of its twisted villain
i thought this book was great the combination of mystery with romance one of my favorites ! ! ! ! would love more books just like this one and a happy ending too
this was a great read and i think one of the first books ive read by nora roberts \( i cant remember if i read her several years ago \) the book includes strong characterizations , lust , dysfunction , mystery into this book and i loved seeing the heroine develop to become her own hero in the end great read
years ago this was first nora read love and mystery ! it has still remained my favorite i loved the twist at the end who new \? read this book and wait for the crazy end wow
this was my first nora roberts book and it will not be my last i could not put this book down her writing style allows the reader to hear and visualize the characters i will recommend this book to everyone
nora roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance , mystery , action scenes , etc and they are all present in this great read i also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality there 's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims the tension is high , and though i had some ideas , i did not figure out who the killer was until the very end
young 8 year old hope lavelle is out on a nighttime adventure to meet her very best friend , 8 year old , tory bodeen , a victum of neglect and abuse by both her mother and father hope has every comfort of life and is the daughter of a successful southern family with a twin sister , faith and an older brother , cade \( kincade \) sneaking out to meet tory , hope is murdered the story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present carolina moon is a very well written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion supporting players such as iris , cecil \( tory 's grandma and significant other \) as well as wade \( her cousin \) , add amazing color to the plot personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life 's turmoil as well as joy i would definitely recommend this book to all , especially nora lovers ! it has murder , mystery , romance , and comedy what more could you ask for in a book
this was the first book by nora roberts that i have read of course , now that i have read it , i plan on reading more of her books
i was waiting in line at the college bookstore , \( buying a textbook \) , and this book was prominently featured i thumbed through and was impressed at the straightforwardness of the questions making a list from these questions will , no doubt , give the impression on an interview , that you are focused , serious and organized a worthwhile investment
this book was recommended to me by several people as i interviewed hiring managers , hr personnel , senior level employees , and others for my own book on the job market by all accounts , my own included , 201 best questions is comprehensive , helpful , and tactical , an important read when one is preparing for an interview it is not an all inclusive resource , only interview targeted , but for what it is , the book is top notch
as a top producer in the recruiting industry , i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking employment it is informative and helpful i loved the section on starting the interview with the question , what are you looking for in a person to fill this position \? i have had two of my own candidates try it and they both got the job
john kador has done a great job with this book as a very experienced executive recruiter , i am constantly shocked at how badly people interview this book will give you some excellent advice on what questions to ask and more importantly what questions not to ask every recruiter and hiring manager would like their candidates to ask good questions in the interview process this book will help stimulate you to ask the correct inquisitive questions if you have lost your job or are going to be looking for a new job soon , then i would recommend purchasing this book
if you have n't seen the show , go and do it if you have , well done
as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic , i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos
i love this musical and i think it is so fun ! i am glad that i got the vocal selections and it was exactly what i wanted
after reading the reviews availible here and other places online i was concerned when i ordered my score of avenue q to read some of the comments of other customers one might thinks this musical score to actually be quite challenging to play
i think this songbok is great i'm practicing some of the songs , and i'm doing very well , and i have n't had lessons in a very long time \( about 9 years \) and i can still hold my own
if you loved the show and you play the piano , this is a must buy
i am musical theater singer who loves to buy sheet music and sing through all the songs i love this past year i have purchased avenue q , wicked , the boy from oz , and assasins on sheet music unfortunately i am an intermediate pianist , so i often find myself player the right hand melody line and adding in as much of the left as i can all these new musicals have such difficult keys , and they change constantly throughout the songs
this score , from avenue q , a show described as a combination of south park and sesame street , is truly excellent be warned the performers on the cd and in the show may make it seem simple , but some of the songs are hard to play believe it or not
just when i think i'm getting out , they pull me back in ! the many aspects of the addictive personality are complex and tricky the chances of understanding how it all works , apart from an excellent book like this , are remote
it is easy to read and understand concepts for entry level counselor or persons who are interested in addictions
nakken 's book provides a clear and comprehensive description of the main aspects of the addicted person he discusses the stages of addiction , society and addiction , family and addiction , and recovery this book is definitely a useful read for those intereste in understanding addiction and what is actually going on within the addicted individual however , we must always remember that people are unique and each case is individualized , thus these are generalizations and may not perfectly fit all who are addicted the most imporatnt thing to realize is addiction is a disease and there is treatment highly recommended book
as a middle aged woman , married to a sex addict in denial , reading this book proved to be a most enlightening experience of the 15 or so books i have read on the subject , i found this to be the most explicit and succinctly worded in just 120 pages i highly recommend it to anyone struggling to comprehend the world of an addict in their life
i would reccomend this book to anyone who is or knows an addict it provides clear information on the topics of addiction , addictive logic , stages of addiction , the addict , recovery , and how to help it clarifies a compicated topic into language anyone can understand and gives one a true sense of just what any addiction drugs , alcohol , sex , gambling , food is really all about it explains all the elements of addiction thouroughly and is a must have for an addict or family member
i am a substance abuse counselor who read the first edition for a better understanding of my patients i feel mr nakken is right on based on my exeperiences in the military we preach that abstenence is the only cure for persons diagnosed with dependence i also like the spiritual link i have found this to be an important element in recovery
i first read this book maybe ten years ago , shortly after i quit drinking at the time i was at a loss in terms of understanding what i had put myself through , and why when i read the book , it gave me an apt context in which to view my addiction every year or two i read it again , and always gain fresh insights it surprised me greatly to read a few reviews here which put nakken 's work down one person said the book was useless because it 's too theoretical funny , but i did n't find that to be the case it definitely offered up thoughts on what i was going through which proved quite practical someone else implied nakken 's book is too contingent on the tenets of aa i did n't find that to be the case either it 's a paradigm for understanding addiction which stands alone from the 12 steps if people choose to use it in tandem with them , so be it but it 's not essential to what he says deng xiaoping once said , it does n't matter if a cat is black or white , as long as it catches mice such is the case here some might feel he 's too theoretical , or take issue with his concept of the addictive personality say what you want the man knows what he 's talking about he offers his readers some keen insights which are quite useful in understanding their own addictive issues , or those of someone close to them i did not read this for a class i read it because i had a problem , wanted to understand it , and when i was finished i actually did as far as i'm concerned , nakken 's book was an excellent buy , and it 's paid for itself maaaaany times over
this book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior , and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help \( or are yourself \) an addict there is no exploration into what treatments will work or not work , and some of what he says does n't really seem to make sense in a real life situation overall , it 's useless unless you are curious about what might \( theoretically \) cause addictive behavior
i had to read this book for my college course most of the people in the class did not like it or agree with many of nakkan 's viewpoints i personally think he is repeating na to us in his own words if you are not into na , yo will not like this book
to my mind , this is the best of michael lewis 's work his style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark , and his writing is at top form next examines the changes wrought by the internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential , mainly in the form of vignettes there is no beginning , middle or end , so if you 're looking for a story with a plot line , this is likely not going to appeal to you the lack of story line is , however , what i found compelling the theme of the book is , there 's this 1800 pound bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding , and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides this is pretty much quintessential michael lewis he finds an individual , or an event , or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift \( a deliberate choice of words here , since moneyball dealt with the emergence of sabrmetrics , whose acolytes all seem to have read the structure of scientific revolutions \)
not a profound book lots of story telling to make a few good points a fast and fun read
michael lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud i think i learned more about wall street from liar 's poker than all the great serious tomes i 've read , while at the same time enjoying it as pure farce , and yet i was left with an increased respect for the people and institutions how is that even possible \?
next the future just happened is about how the internet is changing the world lewis profiles jonathan lebed , a teenage stock market wizard \( the sec says he was a stock market manipulator lewis is n't so sure \) a teenage law expert who has never studied law a teenager in england who is using gnutella software as a springboard to , i do n't know , take over the world , i guess
as a lecturer of e commerce , i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however , i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted
i 've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet , but found this one a notch above the rest whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects , this one went a lot deeper and touched on the meta changes underlying society but far from being a grand , generalist thesis , lewis grounds his observations in real flesh and blood stories that are highly readable his experience as a professional writer shines through on every page
without beating about the bush , let me state that this is one of the best non fiction books i have read on the effects of the internet on our society
the author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet related happenings his intent seems to be to say
this review comes from a post i made on 21 july 2005 on an actors' forum , in honor of one of the amazing , fearless women profiled in the book
this book contains photographs of some of the women i admire most unfortunately , the women are posed holding a large sword as a prop to indicate their fearlessness
after looking at three of the photographs and reading the first page of the introduction , i immediately purchased three copies of this book one for myself , and one for each of my sisters now halfway through looking at these amazing women and reading their inspiriational stories , i am empowered and inspired life is long , and the middle of it is fabulous ! my first book was published when i was 53 and my next one is due out when , god willing , i will be 57 so take heart all you women of an age the best is yet to come , as the authors of this book and the women in its pages will show you you , too , can join this company in making this the most delightful time of your life ! give this book to every boomer babe you know
i purchased two copies of this book the photographs are strong and captivating , followed by awe inspiring stories from a variety of backgrounds it is a perfect gift for any woman in your life
wow ! i just got it and this book is beautiful and what amazing women i am so excited to buy this as gifts for my friends who are in that age range but also just my female friends who are making it up in this world like some of the women in the book the photos are awesome and it is also inspirational to read each of their stories definitely one to keep out on the coffee table for when guests come over
if we follow ledeen off the machiavellian cliff , what is left of the dream of the founding fathers for us to defend \? this book illustrates one thing that is very important in times of stress , normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship , xenophobia , or even megalomania rule their thoughts ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the usa , and he says it without the slightest trace of irony unfortunately for ledeen , he negates his own title , for if we follow his prescription , those who hate our freedoms have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms unfortunately for all of us , ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the bush administration laws , constitution , and even geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means history says otherwise ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world historians , if there are any left , will tell us whether he was right
i'm quite familiar with mr ledeen 's work on national review and eagerly anticipated reading this tome it does n't disappoint , although some of the details are common knowledge to those intelligent enough to know what the goals of those that have used the rop to justify murdering civilians in order to install a global caliphate \( yes , of course , not all muslims feel this way about the infidels mr daniel pipes breaks it into thirds 1 3 appalled at the terrorists , 1 3 that would not personally engage in terrorism but do n't mind others involvement and 1 3 that want to kill us all \)
excellent read for the 'beginner' who is trying to understand islamic extremism it gives the reader background information , details and explanations covering the major terror attacks in the last 25 years , and offers solutions as to how these ogrganizations can be defeated the author also covers which countries or regimes are involved in the financing and supply of these groups as well as which states provide them with training grounds
mr rove has said that mr ledeen is his greatest policy influence for that reason alone you should read this book and find out what these psychos believe
it is imbecilic people like michael ledeen who contribute to the current u s foreign policy which separates the good countries and the terrorists it is common knowledge that the u s has a habit of supporting dictatorships , terrorist movements groups throughout its history yet , the u s and people like ledeen have the gall to declare a battle of good vs evil simply , the u s will support a regime whether it sponsors terrorism or not , if it so suits their interests you have the central asian republics for example , central american in the '80s , saddam taliban in the '80 's , israel now , the list goes on and on so , this war against the terror masters , is a way the u s gov't can fool the american people into bloated military expansionism , imperialism , and a militant unilateralism that will ultimately cause its own demise and , sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the u s will not win for among other things , peak oil the decline of the dollar will bring down the u s economy and hence military industrialist complex very soon in fact , the process has already begun with the iraq war the u s is no exception to the rises and falls of empires of the past , and in fact the collapse will be proportional to its size
ledeen 's book , written nearly two years before the 9 11 commission report would have been a much cheaper and faster way for congress to get to the same result that the cia has so lost its way that it will take a herculean effort to make it effective in fighting islamofascism ledeen points to the willingness of the clinton administration to turn its head after the first attack on american soil in 1993 for the sake of political expediency he also goes back into previous administrations , republican and democrat alike to see how the cia has become a cross between the post office and the agriculture department in efficiency and intensity in protecting the west from the onslaught of international terrorism the parts of the book that are most telling is what the 9 11 commission chose to ignore , the micromanaging of the cia by congress which slowly but surely turned it into a eunuch in the middle east former senator torricelli 's demands for an investigation are particularly amusing given his amendment which effectively prevented the cia from employing the kind of agents we will need to infiltrate the terrorist cells active all over the world today , including in the us
no doubt , michael ledeen knows his stuff , has the inside contacts and provides insightful and compelling analysis and conclusions plus , his style is a pleasure to read as at least one other reviewer has correctly pointed out , the global war on terrorism is so dynamic that it 's pretty difficult for a book like this to maintain currency for long \( it was written pre iraqi freedom \) yet , ledeen makes several enduring points and provides provacative food for thought however , beware everyone is a middle east expert and no one is a middle east expert do n't read this book and accept everything ledeen says without reading other views and doing some critical thinking you 'd be doing yourself a disservice if this were your only source to become informed on the important and complex issues ledeen boldly takes on bottom line this is a compact , concise treatment well worth your time
this book by the noted conservative author michael ledeen gives the reader a good introduction to what this nation must do to eventually defeat the purveyors of islamic extremism and terrorism additionally , the book states the reasons that we are now dealing with the terror menace and how current and prior administrations have failed in their efforts to fight the building evil if you are interested in what will have to be done to defeat terrorism , even though it certainly is not politically correct , pick up a copy of this book highly recommended
this is an excellent , well researched and documented primer on the aims and tactics of the christian right wing i put christian in quotes because i cannot believe that jesus would be anything but horrified and disgusted with what they are trying to do in his name how anyone can claim to believe that jesus was the incarnation in human form of a loving god , while vehemently opposing nearly everything jesus advocated , is beyond me but the right wing christian push to turn america into a theocracy , forcing everyone else to live according to their dictates , is a clear and present danger to our religious freedom that everyone should be aware of read this book and encourage your friends to read it
i strongly encourage the thoughtful reader to consider this book alongside any of the sloppily produced , poorly edited , these people are attempting to destroy our country books produced by the far christian right , for they are of exactly the same genre , and are born of the same unsympathetic fear of the other
i found this book to be based more on emotion than fact the facts that were used were blown way out of proportion and context while it is always healthy to look at both sides of the coin politics included this book would never give a fair representation of the fundamentalist side , because it is so focused on presenting the conservative view from a gestapo perspective
an important warning of the political forces organizing to turn america into a christian theocracy at the earliest possible opportunity
i have a ph d studying the christian right and this is the worst book on fundamentalism and the christian right that i have ever seen what is not outright lies are straw men arguments meant to make anyone who believes in christianity look like an idiot i feel bad for the people who gave it a good review , they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the christian right , they are feeding propoganda for their own side i was given a free copy of this book and after reading it , i threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library , it is that bad be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it , especially on a controversial topics like this one
ignore all the criticisms regarding the production value it is what is inside that is important !
the fundamentals of extremism chronicles in minute detail the talibanization of america it exposes both the high profile theofascists whom even moderate religionists recognize as a threat to their freedom to practise the belief system of their choice , and the behind the scenes theofascists who pull the visible fanatics' puppet strings blaker 's delineation of the bush administration 's conspiracy to abolish education in america and replace it with theofascist indoctrination is frightening , and should be required reading for anyone who disputes that the christian taliban is intentionally doing to america what torquemada did to spain while the land of the free is not dead yet , it is being systematically strangled anyone who does not know that has not read this book
i was surprised to see that my grandmother , who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance , who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give , was completely villified by this book because she is a christian i dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book
what a bunch of hypocrits
this book is wonderful at revealing the evils of religious fundmentalists it should be read by everyone including the religous it is very dense in information with 900 references , it reads almost like a college textbook and cannot be dismissed as simply a collection of anti religious opinions be prepared to read a paragraph or a couple and have to put it down and think for a while
even though most people thought this book lacked what bergdorf blondes had , i personally really enjoyed this book this book was a very light read , but at the same time it was funny and gossipy exactly what i need once in a blue moon and i for one cannot wait for plum sykes next novel
do n't bother characters are lifeless , plot is boring , ca n't believe her first book is a best seller maybe it was just pure luck
if this is supposed to be a satire , then the author forgot the key element wit this waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor , and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through here 's a little advice for the author take thirty five cents out of your coin purse , drop it into the nearest pay phone , dial the number of whoever told you that you 'd make a decent author , and inform them that they have made baby jesus weep
what a pile of vapid tripe reading this book actually lowered my iq i quess i could 've felt stupider , i could 've actually paid for this book if the overexcessive use of the terms darling , amazing , and delicious do n't give you the douche chills , then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that paris hilton is a great musician
another reviewer said it best this is a satire people do n't take it so seriously sykes offers a glimpse into a segment of society few of us see i love her descriptions of fashion and jewelry everything sounds so delicious i lover her writing style and hope she writes another its actually fascinating to think there are really people out there like that
i read bergdorf blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you 'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly , humorous dose of the high maintenance lifestyle of a manhattan socialite i certainly ca n't say the same for debutante divorcee the story is far less engaging the observations of manners , dress , and other details of society life are shallow and do n't add much to the storytelling worse , the characters evolve from boring to saccharine and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative , deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes methinks ps could do better
all of brown 's books are required reading for any one who follows the mystery of spirit yet , grandfather , is my personal favorite stalking wolf was a man fully in confluence with spirit , and with his own personal vision brown has honored the teachings of this apache elder medicine man sage , and in his verse one discovers both profound and practical advice to change the way we walk on mother earth
this book should be required reading for every human being on this earth i could only read one chapter at a time because each chapter is so profound , i needed time to decompress and absorb each one amazing profound more than thought provoking life changing
i 've seen some skeptical comments about tom brown 's alleged apache teacher , stalking wolf all i can say is it does n't really matter whether this book is biographical or a fictitious novel it makes you think , which is the best any book can do i 've browsed brown 's field guides also but they do not show half the heart of grandfather none of the ideas are earth shatteringly new , but somehow brown manages to radiate a real love for wilderness and a concern for where the modern world is headed , without resorting to the same old tree hugger rants that are becoming background noise to most people today his story rings true against black elk speaks and bury my heart at wounded knee , and even if not based entirely on fact , hits the mark it is aimed at surely and squarely great read and i wish brown would write more of those many stories about grandfather that he claims to have
i was deeply affected by the tracker after reading it , when i went to look at the stars in the winter , the cold did n't bother me as much i did n't expect this to be better , but it most definitely is if you 've ever struggled with why humans exist on this planet when we 're so capable of destroying it , you should get this book immediately and read the chapter entitled the tree speaks there are many other gems of native wisdom in here as well
a friend loaned me the tracker and the search a few months ago and i was impressed with the straight forward truths in the writing and the experiences that the author shared i next chose grandfather and was not disappointed each chapter struck me deeply and contained powerful connection with earth and all things truths that will be with me for a long time i highly recommend each of these three books and i look forward to reading more from this author
despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book there is nothing new in this title clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line it is also worth noting that at least one of the great organizations in the book , fannie may , has imploded in an accounting scandal not the worst fad management book ever written , but that is n't saying much
the book separates core values from the operating practices of
this is one of the business classics in the past twenty years it has sold a huge number of copies and i am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read ! as impressive as its sales numbers have been , the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive
a very inspiring book about creating and maintaining a vision for yourself , your company and even applicable to your own family
jim collins' books are well researched , easy to read , and usually provide thoughtful , actionable guidlines for business owners this book fits that mold in the context of describing precisely the framework that is needed to build a company that will both last a long time and outperform the market
this is a book that tries to uncover the common traits between companies considered visionary \( companies that are regarded as being the standard bearers for the industry they compete in , that outperform the market and have been around for at least 50 years \)
i found built to last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success core development and maintenance , personal growth , employee development and more , highlight the outside the bottom line look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader 's tenure of influence although i do n't agree with every aspect of the book i still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking
i'm an employee with a small educational business , and i 've started reading more business related stuff to get some perspective on how i can help our business evolve i recently read first , break all of the rules and i picked this book up as a follow up to get a different vantage point on growing a business this study , completed in the early 1990s , focuses on 18 historically visionary companies that have built stable core cultures that can serve as role models for any business
this book is not for everyone if you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that \( such as long winded language that seems outdated to us today \) , then you should stay away
note to all first time readers this book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula i read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it journey to the center of the earth is also a classic , but i prefer this well written , with a unique story and good visuals throughout the reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the nautilus captain nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers in this one will see man vs man , and man vs nature for some the descriptions of various marine life may seem over done for me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made captain nemo tick mr verne 's book deserves the appelation , far ahead of its time
having chewed and digested around the world in eighty days , five weeks in a balloon and journey to the centre of the earth , i set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of verne the often overlooked true father of science fiction with much relish sure , 20 , 000 leagues seemed bigger than the others i 'd read , but i thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of verne all the way well , i was nearly right
20 , 000 leagues under the sea was a very complex book the authors word choice was what made it so complex , the author used words like vexed zoophytes and connoisseur the majority of these words were old english , which added to the complexity of the book the sentence structure was similar to the word choice , it was also very complex sentences , the sentences were usually not to long but not to short , at times they could be quite long though , and they were old an english style the book itself is about three human beings chasing after a giant narwhal as the author calls it these three characters are known as professor m arronax , a genius professor from france whose passion is to study , conseil , a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor , and ned land , a canadian harpooner conseil and the professor accept an invitation to the boat the abram lincoln , the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant cetacean , or a sea creature this creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds , and so the 3 meet up at the boat they pursue the creature for over a month , when they finally catch up with the lightning fast cetacean they pursue it , however when the creature strikes back ned land , conseil , and professor arronax are thrown into the ocean , and separated from their boat , they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean , to find out that it is not at all a sea monster , but an amazing submarine named the nautilus led by captain nemo they then learn of captain nemo 's plans , and embark on a submarine hunt on the bottom of the ocean , they discover atlantis , they venture to the south pole , and even fight among poulps or cuttlefish of enormous size , 20 , 000 leagues under the sea is full of adventure
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of literature and you should do n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one quarter of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher , and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel , pick up the elegant naval institute press edition , in a modern , complete , updated translation , with commentary by the leading american verne expert today , walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition \( no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint \) less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by jean michel margot , president najvs
the book was awesome ! i have a question to anyone out there who will answer it in the story certain words are capitalized that really should n't be such as time and beauty why \? if anyone knows , drop me a line nikkicello excite co
d is for deadbeat is an odd story kinsey is hired to give 25 , 000 to a fifteen year old should be simple , right \? not with sue grafton writing the book ! ! when kinsey 's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting ! ! next kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check , he was dead now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid !
the client came to kinsey millhone with an easy job she thought deliver 25 , 000 to a fifteen year old kid a little odd , and kinsey was n't sure what to make of this thing so she takes alvin limardo 's retainer check anyhow it turns out that his real name is not alvin limardo , but john daggett and the check of course , is as phony as he is john daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals but he was n't just a deadbeat by the time kinsey caught up with him , he was a dead body with a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead there was four in particular that really wanted him dead kinsey knew his death was no suicide it was a plan to kill john but which one of the four did it \? kinsey must put her detective skills to work and find out someone 's secret
i found this to be one of the best of sue grafton 's books so far i found it extremely suspenseful and was guessing all the way up to the end as to who was the murderer the ending surprised me and saddened me i have found myself engrossed in the series and ca n't wait to get on to the letter e
private investigator kinsey millhone is back again in this fourth installment of sue grafton 's alphabet series this time she is offered a fee to give a 25 , 000 cashier 's check to a young man named tony gahan the check for the fee bounces and kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her , plus the young man she is to give the cashier 's check to everything she finds out about her client is bad he is a drunk , who has killed several people in a car wreck , and appears to be a bigamist when he is found dead , kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives this book is written in grafton 's usual breezy style , and kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book i would recommend the whole series to mystery lovers
sue grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting four books in and i still ca n't wait to read more ! and she gets better with each book in this book \( and to a smaller degree in 'c' \) there were many times where i could n't fathom how kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case but she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest kinsey 's development as a character is also very well done she is a very real , likeable person with amazing depth
as the dad of a teen girl who has gone through a lot of bullying i was nodding my head at the stories then i got to the chapter on dads and daughters and thought at last ! this is the first concrete advice i 've found on how to help my daughter it 's great to recognize that fathers play an important role too one of my daughter 's teachers read this , and is going to start a program at her school to stop relational aggression , so even more girls will benefit
this book on female bullying is an absolutely wonderful sticks and stones can break your bones , but words can break your heart that 's what female bullying would hurt girls deeply this book is worth reading and there are some great take home points i really enjoyed the book and found it helpful only if i read it earlier
whether you are a beginner photograher or you having been taking photographs for years there is a lot in this book that im sure you never thought of when you snapped your picture it has a lot of great information in it
basic photography is a book explaining the basics of photography , technically as well as creatively , in a clear and easy to understand way if you want to know how a camera \( 35mm slr , medium format , large format , digital \) or f stops work , this is the book for you it is a good book for beginners just starting out in photography as well as advanced photographers who just want to fill in the gaps of technical understanding
i started photography in 1987 this book \( the older version of course \) is what i started with i quite recommend it i think its a very useful book to add to your library
mr langford certainly deserves praise for his continued excellence in photographic writing 'basic photography' is the manual for photographers it is clear , concise and entertaining to read this book should be in every photographers library
oh boy i wish i did n't have to finish every book it is just a pet peeve of mine however , i could n't get into this book i see no clear theme i know everyone was horrified at 9 11 , however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse what happens to all the characters \? one is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on starbucks \? another one goes back to her husband one runs into a tree while skiing and dies frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad jeez , i was really hoping to like this book , but i just am relieved it is over
i am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous , but this was disappointing it had a promising start , but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess save your money i wish that i could recover the six hours of my life that i wasted on this novel
i bought this book because i 've read and enjoyed wendy wasserstein 's plays and i knew it was her last work frankly , i wish she had n't written it like many other reviewers , i was reminded of books like hollywood wives in the first half parodies of lifestyles of the super rich , like most chick lit , have about exhausted themselves without more , it 's like been there , done that the second half of the book , if anything , was worse either someone else finished it for her , or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place , i skimmed the last few chapters satire is the dark side of humor it should be witty and thought provoking this book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work
full of painfully obvious cliches i was insulted on so many levels i do n't know where to begin save yourself the pain , run do n't walk
typical obvious \( re \) placement and \( recently all too common \) italian american as disgusting , classless , filthy villain movie producer makes this book a real disapointment
wendy does it again ! i wo n't repeat the story details here as you 've heard them or can read the book description but suffice it to say wendy is very , very smart you know her , you love her , give this one a try ! ! it 's worth it
first off , there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and do n't like to know anything before you read it \( like me \) then do n't read on !
joan borysenko 's book , inner peace for busy people , is an intelligently written , thought provoking read she has demonstrated a deep understanding of those things that create familiar feelings of being overwhelmed and stressed to the max , and better yet , she gives practical solutions on ways to cope with that stress the chapters in this book are short , one page or a little more i found that the best way to read this book was to read a chapter a week and attempt to instill these lessons gradually i can honestly say that it helped me to find new ways to relax and enjoy life , in spite of feeling at times as though i am crazy busy as the author discusses i highly recommend this book unlike other self help books , this guide does n't overgeneralize , or have within it 's pages unrealistic expectations that people would have difficulty implementing in their own lives i found it to be incredibly practical and life changing i feel more rested and relaxed than i have in a very long time
i had heard of this author for a long time and never read any of her work , so it was with careful reflection and consideration that i opened this book attracted by the peace and busy people of the title
this is a fabulous book the author 's writing style is beautiful , inspiring and uplifting the book flows nicely , is pleasing to the eye , and covers everything you could hope to learn about strolling gently down the path to inner peace i 've been reading personal growth books since 1995 and this has become my new favorite i learned so much and have already put it into practice i'm sending a copy to my mother for her birthday and recommending it to all my busy friends even if your life is n't busy , you can gain so much from this book thanks , joan ! i'm going to read your other books now
this book has changed my life the strategies she gives in the book are absolutely wonderful they have helped me take time out for myself and relax and enjoy life it has definitely helped me deal with stress i encounter in everyday life her strategies on relaxing your body through breathing , and the importance of music were great
joan borysenko , who is possibly the smartest and nicest woman in america , has done it again with this gem of a book for those of us with to do lists that appear to be on steroids , \( and sadly that 's just about everybody , right \? \) this is the book practical , helpful , based in grounded psychology and integrated spirituality , eminently readable and instantly translatable into action what can i say \? read it , use it and benefit from it
prof terry tucker , senior doctrine developer saudi arabian ng modernization program
this book is highly recommended to understand the fact that imperalism goes beyond the political and economic domination imperialism stayed in the most subtle way , in the culture said clearly described that the reaction toward imperialism is mutual from the western side , the prejudice and biased and the supremacy feeling , which unfortunately still existed today and from the other side , also prejudice and to the extreme side , anti western
edward w said 's culture and imperialism explores seemingly difficult areas of postcolonial discourse with consummate ease , carefully and clearly definining terms and writing an utterly convincing piece as with all of his texts , culture and imperialism 's main strength is in the conviction of the writer as he puts forward his claims an invaluable tool for those approaching postcolonialism , culture and imperialism is quite possibly the most illuminating piece of writing i have considered a fine text , and one of immeasurable usefulness
denying the suffering of christians under moslem rule is what said wants the west to do the denial of christian suffering by christians who lived among moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked as christians who live in egypt , neither said nor i could marry a moslem woman unless we convert to islam as christians neither said nor i would be allowed entrance to some arab cities as christians , neither said nor i would be allowed to build a church without permission from the president of egypt why is said quiet about that
after listening to a public library audiobook copy of the first artemis fowl \( artemis fowl \) , my children and i were eager to see if there were other books available in the series we learned that our library did not have subsequent copies , so i hurried to amazon to see what i could find we 've now purchased and listened to artemis fowl the arctic incident and have donated it to our public library so others may share in the story not only is each book in the series wonderfully written , with fully crafted , believable characters insofar as fairy tale characters can be believable but the audiobook is narrated by one of the most skillful readers i 've ever heard nathaniel parker , also the narrator for the first book , is back with his fantastic portrayals of our favorite characters this book has all the necessary ingredients for enjoyment comedy , adventure , fantasy all played out through witty and engaging dialog between easily distinguishable characters the author , eoin colfer , must have been a monty python fan too , because some of the lines uttered as asides by a couple of his characters could just as likely have been said by one of the flying circus troupe my family highly recommends this book , in either printed or audio form
ok , so maybe the fowl series is not exactly lord of the rings caliber , or even harry potter level but it is an enjoyable read if you take it for what it is sure , it 's directed towards kids , but this 42 year old kid at heart blew through it in a couple of days , and plans to do likewise with the next two in the series you 'll enjoy it too
the now 13 year old criminal mastermind , artemis fowl , is up to new tricks , and more terrific adventures too short but a good read
my son and i really enjoyed the book it has alot of twists in the plot that keep you hanging on every word i highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a good suspense story with alot of fun attached
i did n't discover the delight that is the artemis fowl series until a week ago , when i read artemis fowl in one day so , of course , i had to pick up a copy of the arctic incident right away , to see if it was as good as the first it definitely is , and in my own humble opinion , i think i liked it even better than the first book there are points throughout the book where artemis , now thirteen , shows a softer , more vulnerable side that i truly enjoyed do n't get me wrong , he 's still an evil genius , but he 's an evil genius with heart , and you ca n't help but love him
you would think , after the outstanding success of artemis fowl , eoin colfer would find it hard to live up to not at all eoin colfer seems to have a knack for turning out books that are impossible to put down , and which are capable of delighting readers of all ages and the arctic incident is no exception
when i stared reading danielle steele 's novels , well over 20 years ago , they were amazing the characters were larger than life , the dialog spot on , and the plots original and well thought out i'm sorry to say that i was drawn to this novel because of its slick cover and interesting premise after reading coming out , i had the feeling the author was as bored writing it as i was reading it in no way could this book have been written by the same author who wrote the ring
i almost was n't going to read this book the description did n't appeal to me at all but , as we all are die hard danielle steel fans , i knew i had to try , thinking oh well , she has to get better !
i also have been a great fan of ds over the many years she 's been writing books however , i'm convinced that she ca n't possibly be writing these books any longer they 're terrible and each time a new one comes out , i think i 'll give it one more try then i complain about the book and vow never again well , this time is the last this book was the worst
over the years i read numerous books by danielle steel and this definitly tops the list as the worst book yet plot is incredibly weak
i have been reading danielle steel since her first book was published and this is by far her worst one yet over the past few years her writing has deterioriated rapidly it 's almost as if she does n't care anymore she knows readers will buy her books no matter how poorly they 're written
oh , please , this book is just ridiculous and trite
i just read this book , quite quickly in one afternoon i think i 've pretty much purchased and read every danielle steel book she 's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads i understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory there is never much suprise as to how a ds book will end , the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns , historical and geographical research she puts into her books this book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books definately not worth the hardcover price time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity this book was fluffy dull

how bad can she get \? \? \? \? i loved so many of her books but this one was bad dont bother read her older ones echoes is the best book of hers i loved it
riveting ! i hated that it had to end marvelous characters , a haunting tragedy and one of those meant for each other relationships that are a hallmark of nora roberts at her best carolina moon is a richly layered , dark and dangerous variation on the cinderella theme it 's also a fine whodunnit with a plot twist worthy of its twisted villain
i thought this book was great the combination of mystery with romance one of my favorites ! ! ! ! would love more books just like this one and a happy ending too
this was a great read and i think one of the first books ive read by nora roberts \( i cant remember if i read her several years ago \) the book includes strong characterizations , lust , dysfunction , mystery into this book and i loved seeing the heroine develop to become her own hero in the end great read
years ago this was first nora read love and mystery ! it has still remained my favorite i loved the twist at the end who new \? read this book and wait for the crazy end wow
this was my first nora roberts book and it will not be my last i could not put this book down her writing style allows the reader to hear and visualize the characters i will recommend this book to everyone
nora roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance , mystery , action scenes , etc and they are all present in this great read i also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality there 's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims the tension is high , and though i had some ideas , i did not figure out who the killer was until the very end
young 8 year old hope lavelle is out on a nighttime adventure to meet her very best friend , 8 year old , tory bodeen , a victum of neglect and abuse by both her mother and father hope has every comfort of life and is the daughter of a successful southern family with a twin sister , faith and an older brother , cade \( kincade \) sneaking out to meet tory , hope is murdered the story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present carolina moon is a very well written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion supporting players such as iris , cecil \( tory 's grandma and significant other \) as well as wade \( her cousin \) , add amazing color to the plot personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life 's turmoil as well as joy i would definitely recommend this book to all , especially nora lovers ! it has murder , mystery , romance , and comedy what more could you ask for in a book
this was the first book by nora roberts that i have read of course , now that i have read it , i plan on reading more of her books
the others in the series were great , and i really looked forward to a breath of snow and ashes it read like it was all gabaldon 's discarded notes for the previous installment i felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book
what more can i say this book is outstanding , just as the entire series and of course jamie is yummy like always ! i do want to correct one thing this is not the final book in the series i just left diana 's website and she reassures us that there will be at least one more book , maybe two for jamie and claire ! ! ! yeah that is all she will promise at this point , but i know we all sigh a breath of relief to know we have more jamie to come \)
this is the last book in a wonderful series by diana gabaldon it is simply great she has a very engaging way of writing that puts you in the book and lets you experience what is happening as if you are there it is obvious to me that she thoroughly researches her book 's time frames as they refer not only to people , but to their way of living and to the sciences available i am not a history buff , but i have learned more \( and enjoyed it \) reading her books than i have learned from any other source to date !
i am hooked on the diana gabaldon outlander series jamie and claire are such a romantic couple who does n't like a guy in a kilt \? \? you want the story to go on and on \( diana , please do n't kill off any characters ! \) let 's keep the outlander series going with another book and another and another
like all of the book in this series this book did have its slow spots but after reading all of the other books in this series i knew it was going to get moving so i could n't put it down it is a great book and i am eagerly awaiting the next book , in this series , to come out
the outlander series by diana gabaldon is wonderful this most recent book does not disappoint her readers there is so much history as well as wonderful characters i met the author last week at a book review she is a marvelous speaker , very intelligent and entertaining she promised there would be one , if not two , more books in this series enjoy
after reading the firery cross i was skeptical when i started this one i thought that it might not be up to her usual standards \( like the 5th book firery cross \) ms galbaldon is back to her exceptional standards if you were disappointed by the 5th book , do n't let that discourage you from getting this one i enjoyed this one very much and look forward to reading her forth coming books
what a wonderful continuation of the fraser saga ! this is a must have for the outlander fans ! do n't miss it
as an avid reader of the series i have been waiting impatiently for this book for a long time i am glad to say that it did not disappoint in any way it is highly recommended just make sure that you have a good two weeks to devote to it
another great book in the series ! i could n't put it down ! it has a few slow spots but well worth the time in the end
the messenger by daniel silva is just as interesting , exciting , and intriguing as every other gabriel allon book
well , imho , not as great as the other books in the allon series , but well worth the read !
very pleased with the price and speedy delievery and quality of the product
in this novel we have the characters we have come to love the writing is tighter and the plot clear not quite as exciting or fresh some further development with leah happens which i wo n't reveal
a caveat to all westerners who may think our most sacrosanct values are protected silva reaches into inner space to warn us of the dedicated nature of the enemy if this is fiction , it is well dressed as a wake up call to its readers
i'am unable to get this message to anyone this is the second book i orderd and both books are bad this one starting on disc 4 all is bad
daniel silva has taken his protaganist right onto the front pages of the worlds' newspapers with his best work to date
this is a timely , well written and exciting book i enjoyed reading it
love silva 's characters and plots only wish is for more , more , more
this is a great resource for individuals looking for some leadership pointers
the world 's benchmark with respect to leadership is the market driven capitalist company , however it seems they have lost their way when compared to the us army after you read this book you will be shocked to find out how far ahead of private business the us army is in the area of leadership
the united states army is the largest training organization in the world and among the subjects it teaches is leadership the army teaches leadership at all levels from the squad leader with only a few subordinates to generals with hundreds of thousands with many years of studying leadership , the army program nets down to the three words in the title of the book
leadership often is assigned a mystical quality , as if people either possess the spark that makes others follow them , or they do n't well , now you can lead without the innate spark in fact , the u s army sets out to prove that anyone can become a leader , as this engaging book from the leader to leader institute explains using the army leadership manual \( abstract available from getabstract \) as its foundation , this volume demystifies leadership promisingly enough , this speedy read persuasively argues that being a leader requires little more than honesty and competence throw in an ability to communicate and a willingness to listen to your people , and you could become the next patton , or at least a respected officer this enlightening tome is a little thin on ways to turn its leadership development philosophy into action still , we recommend it to managers and to those who strive to become leaders
i am a space nut i have read numerous books , seen numerous vhs and dvd stories of everything from the start of the space age to the shuttle flights i have never had a more inspiring feeling than upon finishing light this candle it started a little slow with all the early life details of shepard but , helped later in the book with how why he reacted to many \( and i mean many \) tough situations that he faced in his unbelievable life being a space nut , i was happy to see little details explained in the book that are lacking in other books i have read such things as shepard talking about laying in the lem following an eva on apollo 14 he and mitchell were supposed to be sleeping but shepard talked about the eerie silence and hearing the a c unit click on and off also , feeling like they were going to tilt over and falling out of the bunk when he thought the lem was sliding down the edge of the crater all of these things made it a tough to put down book that i would highly recommend
i had been meaning to read this long overdue biography of alan shepard , and i happened to pick it up in a cruise ship library as i read it i was surprised at the number of factual inaccuracies there is at least one glaring non technical error per chapter , which calls into question almost everything else between the covers numerous reviews here mention more problems with technical aspects of the book that i was unaware of , but which do not surprise me given the apparent lack of proofreading and fact checking
i missed an opportunity to go to a book signing where alan shepard was signing copies of moon shot i figured i would have another chance but then before long he was gone what a thrill it would have been to have shook the hand of the first american in space
i second colin burgess 's insightful review thompson 's description of the flight portions of apollo 14 is derived almost exclusively from barbree and benedict 's unreliable moonshot and , consequently , bears only a passing resemblance to reality the critical events related to the abort switch and landing radar simply did not happen as described in my work on the apollo lunar surface journal , i have always found it useful to check astronaut memories against other sources i can only wish that thompson had exercised such care
alan shepard was the first american man in space this occured on may 5th , 1961 with john f kennedy in office i find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing well , like the old saying goes better late than never
the author has done a good job on this one putting together a through biography of a man who fiercely guarded his privacy the information gathered to create this book required much research by the author and the results that he has pieced together reveal insight into one of america 's most enigmatic heroes a good read
having read most of the books about the glory days of nasa , this one stands out as one of the best unlike a number of the recent autobiographies of the astronauts , shepard would not have written this book himself he was too private a person thompson has written an engaging chronicle of what it takes to be the best of the best in the astronaut corps
as a close follower of space exploration , i have read many of the biographies autobiographies of the astronauts of the early space program and greatly enjoyed this book in a review on this site , george s williams claimed it was poorly written and riddled with inaccuracies like other forms of writing , an editorial should provide support of your claim , so , mr williams , i would appreciate if you could share with me and others specific aspects of the book that displeased you \( i am more interested in falsities of the book than your disliking of the author 's style \) please post a response on this website or email me at sbd218 nyu ed
with fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described after all , the reader is seated in a comfortable chair , one assumes , in pleasant surroundings but such is not the case with this novel the distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning , and like the wedding guest in coleridge 's poem , i was dragged from ohio to mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things i did n't want to see but could not avoid
i really am enjoying the audio recording of this book , but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word , to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous i understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece , but i think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it
i had to read this book for school i thought i would love it , but it turns out i was wrong this book was mind numbing it is drawn out and boring i almost threw the book away and rented the movie i should have this books sucks do n't waste your time reading it
a time to kill is definitely grisham 's best novel it 's interesting that it was grusham 's first novel , but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published the story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly racism , murder , justice , revenge , law and order , etc the story will hold you from start to finish most of grisham 's newer novels are simple , predictable stories that bash attorneys that is not the case with a time to kill it will grip you , tear you and entertain you all at the same time
a time to kill and the broker are my two favs from grisham suspense is the name of the game i like books that make me read them straight through because they 're so suspense filled another great novel is deadly behavior by dee sullivan
i have been interested in reading something by grisham for quite a while , but i was recently pushed to actually read one of his books when i saw the movie version of a time to kill the obvious book to start with was a time to kill i had heard that grisham is good , and i really enjoyed the movie , so i was expecting a lot i was not disappointed this book brings out some very interesting ideas about murder and the justification for it it also gave a very large amount of information about the legal system in general and trials in particular this legal iformation was probably my favorite part
i 've read many of grisham 's novels , and this remains my favourite it addresses complex issues and does not attempt to gloss them over i recommend this novel to those more familiar with grisham 's more recent work this is what he is capable of , and it is outstanding
this is my all time favorite book in one word powerful grisham does an excellent job at bringing the characters alive and making you care about them there is a lot of description to help you understand the south at a time when blacks were begining to be people , not things wonderful
john grisham has quite a reputation as being a very prolific author being the best selling author the 90 's means you 've got quite a reputation so i wanted to see what all the fuss was about and i picked up a time to kill needless to say it was a good book , but there are a few moments where it glares as it is grisham 's first book \( and believe me , in some areas it shows \) , i 'd expect a lack of substance surprisingly , there 's substance but there are times when the book really rambles on for a very long time
a tme to kill , the debut novel from acclaimed writer john grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a young black girl soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic , organic notions of the case , and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made true , the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50 100 pages without question , but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking , not answering , questions that need to be asked grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he would n't change a word with a story like that , you can see that he does n't need to , compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling in the end grisham nails it out of the park , and leaves his readers yearning for more
creative or not , this is one of the best books you 'll ever buy to help you discover how to get the world to stand up and take notice it 's contemporary , no nonsense , and filled with tons of suggestions on how to promote yourself or your business for me , the added bonus were the mini interviews sprinkled throughout not only were they interesting , but they gave up lots of anecdotes and nuggets of wisdom from people who have successfully been there and done that half practical advice , half motivational tour de force this tiny little book will send you through several yellow highlighter pens ! i highly recommend it , you wo n't regret the purchase
having had the fortune of learning from lee in person , i can tell you that he is right on with all of his suggestions , in the world of the right brainers his promotional tactics work i have been using many of them and here are some of my successes
i have owned self promotion for the creative person for two and a half years now i regret that i did not write a review sooner , since it is one of the best motivational books i have read it has helped me to transform a fun but unsuccessful hobby business into a thriving and extremely satisfying mission , in which i have found my passion
i'm a career counselor in new york city and self promotion for the creative person is one of the books that i most frequently recommend it is upbeat , creative and inspiring this phenomenal book helps people shift their negative attitudes about self promotion so that instead of feeling ashamed of marketing their creative work , they consider this part of the creative process i 've seen this book dramatically shift the attitutes and actions of countless people , resulting in well deserved success for all of them in their various creative fields
i have not been paid to make this review i am not a friend or relative of mr silber , however , i have quickly become a fan self promotion for the creative person should become the creative person 's 'bible' keep it in a save place \( a pedestal if you have one \) and refer to it often it is a well organized and effectively inspiring guide that calls you into action open any page at any time and you will find something that moves you and gets you promoting on your terms in a way that is comfortable yet effective mr silber understands the mindset of the creative person and offers ways to overcome the obstacles that they face and offers unique tips and techniques to achieve success
lee silber has written a book with a plethora of ideas in an extrememly valuable way from one creative person to another if you are looking for a book to take care of all your self promotion problems , you probably have so many issues that a book on self promotion will not help you but for the creative person who needs to prime the pump this book is a goldmine not all of these ideas will work for you surely something will sometimes the author offers simple advice \( i e , smile \) however , the simple can be the most profound think about it how many people to do you know and interact with that if they took that one piece of silber 's advice \( to smile \) they would go to a whole new level of personal effectiveness ! so this is not a read for the linear folks who want to the expert to tell them how to solve all their issues that 's called a normal book and there are plenty of those out there this is an awesome book with practical ideas for creative people who will love silber 's smorgasboard style of writing i loved the book precisely because it 's content and methods are out of the ordinary , simple , doable , and fun ! i enjoyed this book so much that i read most of the creative series he has written as well
mr silber must indeed be very good at self promotion he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book
i fit the typical profile of a creative person as described by author , lee silber this means that , up until now , i 've focused 100 of my energy on developing my craft and felt my art should speak for itself i found most self promoters to be pretty obnoxious and a big turn off but somehow , the author manages to show how promotion can actually be creative and fun silber gives so many examples that there 's bound to be something that will match your personal style the best thing is that every time i read from this book i find myself coming up with ideas of my own and that , in itself , has made it worth every penny thanks , lee ! !
lee silber knows how to suggest lots of approaches so there 's something for everyone his own creativity shows itself brilliantly in this book whether you 're just starting out or have been marketing for awhile , you 'll do well to have this book and read it
lee silber 's book self promotion for the creative person get the word out about who you are and what you do , is honestly one of the most straightforward and realistic books on getting you and your business heard above the din , in this crowded marketplace i 've read books from sergio zyman to jay conrad levinson , and i feel lee silber 's book ranks right up there if you are a business owner or an entrprenuer , this book has hundreds of creative ideas to get your own word of mouth going and the buzz going about you and your work everyone knows that word of mouth is the key to new and continued business , but how do you generate it \? how do you keep it going \? what can you do to be different \? how do you market what you do and have real success \? all of these and many other questions are answered with very creative but sound business ideas this is definitely a book to have in your personal and business library
i read so many books as a kid i ca n't even begin to try to remember them all this is a great way for anyone to keep track of their readings i 've recently started reading for pleasure again and find much comfort that i have my feelings and memories about the book at my finger tips no more wondering 'why was it i liked that book so much , i ca n't possibly remember , it 's been so long since i 've read it '
i admit , when i first opened this book , i thought it would contain a dry discussion of how to use ajax methods with php but the book turned out to be so much more than advertised , i think its title must be wrong it should have been called , how to use ajax methods with php , mysql , dom , css , svg , xsl , xml , rss , and javascript frameworks i certainly never expected to read it cover to cover , but that 's what i did
this book teaches by example the first few chapters introduce ajax and what part php , javascript and xml all play then the remainder of the book takes you through several example applications the example apps are simple enough that you can easily follow these applications include form validation , chat , suggest and autocomplete , charting with svg \( scalable vector graphics \) , using grids , and drag and drop
'ajax and php' is a very mediocre book with a lot of code in it , not especially good for learning , and not worth the price if you want a really good ajax book , i recommend 'ajax in action'
this book tends to jump right in and show you the important parts of the code you will need for your applications it walks you through creating some of the more requested scripts and explains each step in just enough detail to give you a good grasp that said , the book is n't a major read at under 300 pages , which makes it light enough to get through in a weekend if needed i highly recommend this book for those wanting to combine the power of ajax with the speed and ease of php
ajax and php came at exactly the right time in my self inflicted education as i am just now gaining functional literacy in oop , client server php , css et al
the book is good , the topic is right , and pretty much everyone is thrilling to learn how to benefit from ajax even if this means you 're going to use a lot of javascript , which you thought it was not necessary , since you know php , a powerful language , right \?
this book assumes a working knowledge of php , xml , javascript and mysql and that you have php , mysql , phpmyadmin and a server such as apache installed on your computer in this book the authors , cristian darie , bogdan brinzarea , filip chereches tosa and mihai bucica , teach their readers how to add ajax client side features to php driven web applications
if you are a php programmer who is looking to start integrating ajax in your upcoming projects , then this book will be a perfect start for you the book focuses more on code rather than theory , and explains the pile of code in an easy manner
i think the marketing hype for ajax has some people skeptical so let 's get the record straight ajax is here to help move web development ahead into the arenas that it needs to be in , while not needing to rely on flash to implement a killer interface it utilizes standard technologies that have been around , and is functional on almost all web browsers , but with a new mentality and intention it 's also a load of fun to develop , and see the results
thank you a thousand times , ms walker , for the gift of your new poems they literally danced off the pages and into my soul as i read them i enjoyed the preface and especially being introduced to the shaman priestess healer , maria sabina my favorite poem is thanks for the garlic you are a beautiful , amazing apprentice elder and someone i definitely will emulate in my own journey to become
i saw ms walker read poems from this book last night in los angeles she spoke of how she thought she was done with writing and then the poetry started one day she described the return to poetry as a spring beginning to flow again anyone involved in creative pursuits , such as writing poetry , can surely relate to the spring metaphor these poems are simply beautiful and seem effortless as you read them they seem to come from a vast , open space reading the poetry engages the reader in a celebration of life , the spirit , and hope for humanity highly recommended
her poem from this volume thousands of feet below you is circulating on the net right now
alice walker possesses a gift that she has continually shared with her readers in both her fiction amp poetry writing she weaves a web of magnificent beauty , keeping alive the hope that humanity and life is good her work comes from a source of profound truth deep within , awakening that part that is within each human being when i feel disoriented or in need of solace , alice walker 's writing sings to me as a mother to child i feel blessed to have discovered her writing , as it has been a gift beyond all others her poems rise up as prayers to the divine amp i am thankful to experience this connection so thank you , alice , for sharing your profound gift with us all
this book is the biggest piece of literary trash i have seen in a long time it is a collection of peace mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life the agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author the poems are rather sophomoric at best , and are poorly written most of them make no sense you would have to be inside ms walker 's head to comprehend her contorted style it appears that ms walker should re enroll in a college level poetry class this book is trash don't waste your money on this piece of junk i took my copy back after 24 hours
as a therapist , i recommend it for relaxed reading as an amateur gourmet cook , i consider this book the basic cookbook for any kitchen it covers the culinary world of yesterday and today
if you want recipes for old fashioned candy and such , this is a good reference however recipes have changed radically in the last decade so the use of butter as a main ingredient has gone down in favor also classic american cooking tends to be fattening and bland new cookbooks use fresh ingredients and different methods of adding flavor besides using butter and flour however the art of candy making and canning is not as prevelant , so i find this book useful for those aspects unless you are a triathelete though , i would n't want to live on the recipes here american cuisine has come a long way and the classic joy of cooking demonstrates that to a tee
my brother owns a very popular restaurant award winning in fact he has lots of cookbooks he uses in addition to his own or his chef 's creations many a time when i asked my brother for a recipe he whispered to me that he got it from the joy of cooking
we had irma 's old joy of cooking until it fell apart we bought what we thought was a reprint of it several years ago it was not !
this was a gift to my mother in law to replace an old copy that is falling apart we love the joy of cooking , especailly the older editions \( i'm not very familiar with the new one yet \) i use it as a reference whenever i'm dealing with some ingedient or process i 've never seen done before before i cook i use joy as a starting point for the basic recipe \( proportions , tempurature , length of cooking \) and then go from there with my own creation this allows me to be crative in the the kitchen
found recipes dated , layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how to is useful , its generally from another era bought gourmet cook book instead
this is my second copy of joy of cooking i had the 70 's printing , but it must 've gotten lost during a move i thought i was buying the 80 's printing when i recently ordered it from amazon , but i got another 70 's one but that 's fine it 's still the bible my mother swore by the 1952 betty crocker cookbook , i cook according to irma rombauer
if you want bad gourmet recipes , then this is your book the basic information is poor at best , and the fancy gourmet recipes are not even good when i begin to cook a meal , i 'll look in the joy of cooking , get disappointed , and go and find what i want on the internet the recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century this book should have stayed there i'm sure your grandma loves it though ! squid in ink sauce \? ! for real \? c'mon
i agree with everyone here , this book is comprehensive , easy to use , probably essential i have the 1962 version that i inherited from my mom i used to use it when i was a young girl , a teenager , a college student , all through my cooking upbringing so i'm afraid i treat it like a well worn pair of shoes , meaning that i mostly turn to sexier books for cooking inspiration french gourmands , nouvelle superstars , vegetarian california mamas but when i need the most basic of advice , the joy of cooking is always there , dependable , reliable , like grandma waiting for you with a nice cup of tea and solid , sensible advice some of the recipes can be bizarre i tried the recipe for those french doughnuts like i had in new orleans , but the result was a strange concoction of boiled water and flour that you spoon into hot fat , nothing like the real thing and others , like the muffin recipes , tend to be kind of blah but on the whole it 's a dependable resource with a wide , almost encyclopedic , range you can always have your flings with the sexier books , and after they break your heart joc will still be there waiting for you with that cup of tea
i bought a paperback edition of this book 20 years ago and it has not stood the test of time well pages and entire sections of pages have fallen out , the back cover and last 5 pages are detached and the pages are yellowed so what am i doing about it \? buying another one , of course ! this time , i'm splurging on the hardcover edition which i hope will last longer it is such a wonderful cookbook with intructions on everything from how to boil water to butchering a turtle for soup any cooking question you have will be answered by this book it is wonderful ! i was going to buy the new revised edition , but after reading many reviews on the amazon website , i decided to heed the advice and stick to the original highly recommended cookbook !
the two new sciences are required study at thomas aquinas college in california i and a number of students have this paperback edition the pages come loose and just keep coming loose as you study the propositions even being very careful with the book , the pages still keep coming out i have heard a number of other people complain of this same problem
this is a book that describes different african tribes from each letter of the alphabet this is a great way to teach children about african tribes , and the book also pronounces each tribe so it is easier to read the illustrations are wonderful and full of detail this would be a great lesson in the classroom to learn about africa it would also be great to use each page as a poster or transparency
this is an amazing book , practically one of a kind ! the information , illustions , and luster of the indigenous african cultures is beautiful to behold i recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation , life there is nothing so intricate , so inveloping and powerful as life in this form pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading , which is , in fact , very enjoyable
ashanti to zulu presents 26 african tribes , from a to z , and lets children learn something about the culture and customs of each one aside from being a learning experience , the book is visually eye popping the illustrations are so gorgeous you 'll want to blow them up and frame them the book won a well deserved caldecott medal for the best illustrated children 's book of 1977 it 's a great book for helping children to learn about some of the peoples of our least known populated continent , and the pictures will hold the kids mesmerized it 's a volume that belongs on every youngsters bookshelf
very motivational with good ideas it makes you think about what you can do better in your own business
small business owners beyond the start up phase will want to take a look at alpha dogs how your small business can become a leader of the pack eight strategies for success here 's a primer on how to stand out spectacularly from the crowd in a competitive world , using the allegory of the 'alpha dog' to analyze trends and directions author donna fenn is a contributing editor for inc magazine with over twenty years' experience writing about such trends , so alpha dogs comes from the top of the pack here eight representative companies which have pursued different and specific strategies for success are profiled , with analysis from real world scenarios offering wisdom from different industries
i picked up alpha dogs as part of my typical random reading program , and was amazed intensely interesting and packed with great ideas , alpha dogs is a must both for small business owners and corporate bigwigs alike compiled by donna fenn of inc magazine , the book examines eight extraordinary small companies
i have just completed alpha dogs , a new book written by donna fenn
although a sole proprietor , i found alpha dogs to have great relevance to my own business i stayed up late at night , taking notes on all the advice i thought would be indispensible ms fenn 's writing style is wonderfully concise and lively i found the case study format to be much more engaging than anything didactic and the summaries at the end of each chapter make it easy to return again and again a great book for any entrepreneur , big or small , who aspires to be an alpha dog
then buy this book it 's engaging , easy to read and provides clear examples of how daring small business owners beat big competitors time after time alpha dogs is short on theory , long on real world success stories if you buy it , you wo n't need to hire a coach like me you can do it on your own !
it seems like all we hear in the news lately is about outsourcing , the stripping away of defined benefit and retirement plans , and that there are no further opportunities to be found in business unless you are one of the lucky few at the top of a multinational corporation in the face of such constant bad news , this book is a breath of fresh air
nearly any newscast will talk of big companies that have gotten themselves into really deep troubles just this week it was ford and general motors these companies just loved big suv 's because they made so much money on them but at 3 gasoline well you do n't see ads offering big sales on japanese hybrid automobiles
being recently involved with a national retail dealers association \( narda , north american retail dealers association \) , the power of knowledge and motivation has never been made more obvious as the key to success
i read entrepreneurial business books all the time it 's part of my job because i speak and consult with small business owners who want to turn their businesses into consumer destinations sometimes the books i read are theory sometimes they 're written by marketing professors who talk a good game , but have never run a business in their lives donna fenn 's book is different she found real life small business successes that any business owner can identify with this book is so chocked full of real life , 'these really work' tactics that an entrepreneur can read this book , and immediately apply them i also appreciate that fenn takes you through the life of the businesses she highlights she does n't just hit the high points she describes the trauma and agony of becoming an alpha dog business i 've already recommended alpha dogs to my coaching clients because i know that they 'll read the book , and be able to mirror the successes of the businesses in the book i do n't know if fenn intended this book to be used this way , but i 'd require it in my course , if i was a professor wanting to prepare my students for the real world
i picked this book up on a whim and am thankful i did the quote that grabbed my attention was on the back cover , if you ca n't face one more slab of meat or chicken this book can help this book just may have been written with me in mind ! what i like best about this book is that it is informal , light , and is an easy read i appreciate that people on any low carb diet could benefit from this book i see how this book would help people who are just beginning to diet , or who have fallen off track , however , this was not my case i was really just looking for some added motivation i did read the chapter about just starting or getting back on track but especially loved the later chapters about continuing success and hidden carbs this book left me feeling more knowledgable and charged to continue on my way to a lighter me
once you 've fallen off the low carb wagon , getting back on track can seem a daunting task this book offers a sensible , gradual plan for easing back into the low carb life it worked to get me successfully into a struggle free induction when induction was always a major challenge before the information about hidden carbs , artifical sweeteners , and other challenges low carbers face regularly is also a great asset i 've only tried a few of the included recipes so far , but they 've all been very good
the 7 day rescue recovery plan is a valuable addiction to the hellers' writing , not to mention for the ever expanding low carb library perhaps the best advice in this book is to work up to your carbs on your reward meal \( side note i despise the term reward meal we are not animals , and we are not being rewarded for anything \) most carb addicts , when they eat a meal with carbs , tend to head for the carbohydrates first and get sidetracked with the other stuff like protein or fiber \( hey , that garlic bread just looks more appealing than a salad \) working toward your carbs gives you a sense of pace and discipline
i find this new addition to the heller 's body of work in the low carb war a must read i have used the previous books in the past and found them to quite informative i lost 20 pounds using the heller 's method never had i successfully lost weight on any other plan \( carbohydrate lifespan program \) with the 7 day recovery book i found the reason for my stall in weight loss and was back losing within 48 hour i am type 2 diabetic and this program immediately lowered my blood sugar levels if you are interested in the latest info on low carb living purchase this book
i bought this book at a yard sale , just out of curiosity it 's been a good long time since i 've had an opportunity to read some marxist propaganda doggone it , the soviet union crashed and all the fun stopped the propaganda wars of the 80s were a hoot for while between vladimir posner and the ever dwindling , drowning cpusa , we got a glimpse of a kinder , gentler marxism this book reads like something out of people 's daily world i gave the book two stars for nostalgia value
man could buk write but could he write i suppose we are all just posers and pretenders and wanna bes in his shadow , but buk is essential reading for anyone interested in studying the craft and art and technique of writing , of , as buk would say 'laying down the word , ' and when it came to it , buk could do it better than anyone i 've tried to write a passage with as much simplicity and elegance and attitude as he had and failed completely his sparse prose and mastery of the obvious and attitude all contribute to a unique style in american letters that exemplify the beauty of our language when wielded by a master post office , hollywood , factotum and ham on rye are must reads for any serious student of modern writing and damned entertaining stories to boot
this had to be one of the most enjoyable books i 've read in years it 's actually based on bukowski 's life and the events that lead up to and involve the making of his movie barfly it 's totally off the wall , but bukowski 's take on hollywood 's own particular brand of insanity is probably just as true today as it was when charles bukowski penned this masterpiece of the absurd definitely a great book from one of my favorite writers highly recommended
excellent story about how charles' barfly movie came to be written in all honest candor and the trials an author has to endure throughout the system of getting this complete
although far from bukowski 's best , this is a revealing send up of what happens when brutal honesty \( buk \) interacts with the california entertainment industry a roman a clef about the making of the independent film barfly based on bukowski 's life and some of his earlier stories , the book shows bukowski finally gaining some recognition and acceptance near the end of his career the movie stars faye dunnaway and hollywood badboy mickey rourke who does a good job slurring and walking about with hemorrhoids yet it appears from the text that bukowski would have preferred sean penn , who was originally cast in the part , to play him in the film penn had more heart as always with bukowski , there are real emotions , honest appraisals , and bone cutting prose not compromise , pandering , mediocrity , and unfortunately often successful attempts by msg dazed writers to pluck the heart strings and collect the cash in all his books , bukowski 's presence is perhaps the most palpable of any author behind his fictional protagonist this is , one might argue \( and phillipe lacoue labarthe did , in the paradox of the actor \) , the diametric opposite of actors , whose abilities lie in taking on the personae of others , and consequently losing their own identity in the process the story is that when bukowski , although much older , first encountered arnold schwazenegger in hollywood , he had to be restrained from attempting to fight him just for being such an obvious phony far from his most testosterone crazed , drunken bull self here , he does not seduce but does manage as if for old time 's sake to pull onto his lap the pretty co star during a wine drenched film party even and especially when confronted with \( and making some money off of \) l a s billion dollar dream machine , bukowski \( as alter ego henry chinaski \) preserves his uncompromising heart and unwavering eye in the face of the ugly truth a welcome tonic to hollywood 's treacle
buk was right his take on screwie hollywood funny and true he was smart to stay clear of hollywood 's phonies and neurotics \( with the exception of writing barfly for the big screen \) see the flick by the way , doubt you 'll be disappointed unless you 've got a bit too much starch in your white collar buk wrote about blue collar down and outers like himself , and did it with a uniqueness and originality all his own
this novel by charles bukowski is basically the making of the movie barfly all of the people are recognizable even if given not so obvious fictional names if you are a lover of bukowski and a lover of barfly the movie , this is a five star classic if you are a lover of either of the above it 's still a four star , well written work i found that this novel exceeds both pulp and women , his other known longer works , in both writing style and movement of plot and characters theme wise it takes you to the familiar places that bukowski often drags you to
barfly is what first brought buk into my life , so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read it 's a bit goofy in spots \( some of the names buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous \) , but classic buk nonetheless why is n't buk taught in college english classes yet
dr rosenfeld is a very knowledgeable and common sense doctor and i value his opinions
i am so well pleased with the information and suggestons in this book that i am back here today to order the same copy to be shipped to my family members in flordia amd texas dr rosenfeld speaks in a language we can all understand
thank you dr rosenfeld for your informative articles and books you are available to all patients with your informative wisdom and advice it is comforting to be able to read your books when illness or uexplained pain occurs you are the doctor in the white coat who used to visit patients at home now you and your books are by our bedside to reassure us and inform us of the best medical treatment and advice
dr isadore rosenfeld steps forward to help those of us who may be in the dark concerning health problems , managed health care , or who may be locked into an insurance company that dictates treatment including physicians , and offers straightforward advice and guidance in order to educate patients as to what their rights are and what they should be asking and receiving this is an important book for americans today
with all the publicity this book got i thought i would learn something i did n't know very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning very disappointed
everyone must have this book ! in this era of managed care \( managed costs \) , patients have to be pro active in order to get the quality of care and appropriate treatments to ensure their health and well being patients will no longer feel powerless with this book at their fingertips

i am computer professional and i search a job of comput
this is a wonderful book for anyone who is curious or who enjoys reading weird , funny , gross , or just plain interesting annecdotes the guy invested a lot of time in his quest to read the entire encyclopedia , and if this book is the only result of that investment , it was time very well spent i loved it
a fun book a sort of biography mixed into encyclopedia enteries it 's hard not to like a book based on random odd facts and , by entwining the events of his life with the entires , a j manages to make this as much an auto biographical novel as a book of odd facts regretably , jacobs is pretty much a jackass
this book had me laughing out loud from start to finish jacobs is clever and he seems completely honest and unafraid to write candidly about the sorts of thoughts and feelings that everyone has but few admit well okay , maybe not everyone maybe just me and him anyway , i have trouble imagining any intelligent person not liking this book
a plain old fashion just down right enjoyable book full of twists , turns and laughs !
this is a great book to read right before bed as it is light , easy to follow and profoundly amusing it cheers you up
i just love books about funny stupid quests
a j jacobs journey through the encyclopedia brittanica is a very entertaining one , and you may learn a few totally useless things as you go through it a good number of books have been written recently about people 's quests to do some pretty ridiculous things cooking your way through julia child 's mtaofc , riding the tour de france route by yourself , reading the entire encyclopedia brittanica this is definitely one of the best in that genre
the know it all is a laugh out loud book about a sarcastic new york editor who attempts to read the encyclopedia brittanica from a z chapters are broken out by letter and topics range from important world history to weird mensa conventions although the book is set up to go through each volume in order , the author makes the book light and the reader never feels like he she is plodding along through the alphabet just to get to z what makes the book particularly interesting is the author 's journey throughout the year which starts as an almost absurd self challenge to a deeper contemplation on the value of knowledge highly recommended
as others have pointed out , this book is hard to put down it contains tons and tons of interesting facts \( generally told with the exactly right amount of humor \) this in itself is n't what makes it great \( there are many great trivia books out there \) a j jacobs' personal tale during his quest is really what makes this book stand out so much he really knows how to mix his personal life with what is being learned through the britannica
i agree with all the other reviewers
i read this book about 2 years ago so the details have certainly gone in one eye and out the other \( as opposed to ears \) but , there is one idea this book told me about conservation do n't sweat most of the small stuff concentrate on the 2 primary causes everything else flows from that
the consumer 's guide to effective environmental choices \( cgeec \) is perhaps the most useful guidebook ever published for environmentally concerned consumers it 's divided into two parts the first part \( 82 pages \) describes the impact of typical consumer activities in terms of environmental damage and resources consumption the second part \( pages 83 178 \) identifies the specific actions consumers \( citizens \) should take to minimize environmental impact appendix a provides detailed descriptions of the research methods and statistical analysis , while appendix b is a comprehensive list and description of resources for consumers
this book gave a good in depth history of osama bin laden and his network of terror from the late 80 's to today it 's definately a good read if your into this kind of stuff
this book is very disappointing , as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear , ie bin laden and aq are everywhere , responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups \( such as ji \) are aq franchises total bollocks the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a scholar who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
i really enjoyed this book i think it 's the most detailed i 've read
if you wish to destroy your database or knowledge on al qaeda , buy this book
inside al qaeda global network of terror was one of the most compelling books about al qaeda and the new threat of terrorism that i have ever read the non bias straightforward writing of gunaratna brought to light the vastness of terrorism and its reach throughout the world the book is very concise in the facts and the chapters are very fluid like if you desire to learn about al qaeda and how complex it really is , i recommend this book over all an excellent read
one of the earliest books on al qaida that offers comprehensive insights into the organization 's structure and activities in terms of explaining the 'what' , 'how' , 'who' and 'where' behind al qaida 's operations , this book is impressive however , compared with others in the discourse , the book is weak in explaining the 'why' behind the controversial role of salafism and al qaida 's rise using islam as a battle cry
this is a wonderful daily inspirational book sarah ban breathnach does a great job of reminding you of what is important it is very easy to lose sight of yourself in all of the day to day activities she does an excellant job in jogging your memory i highly recommend the book
simple abundance is the best kind of meditation book for each day has a lengthy enough message that everyone can find something therein a positive to focus on during that day this one was a gift i gave to my daughter and i recommend it to all
after being in an abusive relationship for ten years , i had feelings of hopelessness i had no positive outlook about anything and the thought of a 'future' was slim to none in my eyes i have always wanted to be a writer , but the misery that i was living in kept me from having a clear mind and my thoughts were jumbled and disoriented in 1997 , my parents bought me simple abundance i read it , reread it , and read it again i followed sarah 's suggestions and participated in all that she suggested with the wonderful inspiring activites she offered in the book my book was published in may 2003 ! i have a wonderful marriage with my 'new' husband and am living my life as it is suppose to be i am living the life god intended me to live thanks to sarah banbreathnach for sharing her insights and taking the time to write such a wonderful book that has changed a lot of lives for the better
sarah breathnach writes about the simple pleasures in life in such a way that it makes you want to try all the wonderful small joys she speaks about in the book even my husband picks it up and reads the daily messages he comes out with a smile on his face with some kind of comment on the subject matter each day !
this book continually gives me encouragement and motivation it helps to point out all the good things in life without having to go shopping or changing anything in my life but the way i see things i enjoy this book very much and recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration and validation the author highlights all the wonderful things in a woman 's life , and literally celebrates the fact that we merely exist she helps with her terrific sense of humor , and her ability to admit her faults that are not unlike our own she reminds us of positive things we have that we may miss in the day to dayness of our lives
dip into simple abundance by breathnach for reminders to take care of yourself , your mind and soul there is a different essay for each day of the year one can read at random , choosing the topic most meaningful for the moment maybe it is setting your own pace , playing hooky or quieting the wants
this book , at first looks like a book of daily wisdoms starting with january 1 , but it is also actually teaching woman how to embrace themselves and their value
i was personally a little confused with the review written by patty benson , who claims that sarah ban breathnach is jewish and that is why she makes so many refrences regarding the jewish religion to begin with the author is not jewish , she was raised catholic so the book is full of non jewish wisdom secondly , the book is not about religion which i feel people might assume from the previous review , the book incorporates elements from all religions and searches out the spirtual aspects within each that can be universally appreciated by everyone and yes sometimes this does include quotes from jewish mystics if you 're looking for a book that excludes the world at large and focuses on christianity then perhaps you should read the purpose driven life if you 're looking for a book that embraces the idea of spirit and tries to relate it to all walks of life then you should read simple abundance
as many people did , i received a copy of simple abundance as a christmas present when it was discussed on the oprah show a few years ago that new year , i started reading the daily entries for the next few years , my new year 's resolution was to daily read the appropriate daily entry even though i looked forward to reading the thoughtful observations , i never seemd to make it through january without missing a day last year , i saw gail kasper on tv talking about failed new year 's resolutions and got a copy of her make a decision to win cd gail kasper 's personal experience , her systematic approach and workbook have shown me how to have a less stressed filled life i now find the time for reflection and am on my way , as sarah ban breathnach says , to find the authentic life we were born to live i'm ordering both products to give as a present
this one of the many pop up books robert has out right now i 'd get alice in wonderland and or the wizard of oz for your bookshelf these are really great books to own the night before christmas is just not as cool as the other two books i mentioned above
of all the robert sabuda 's pop up books this one is really awesome the way the reindeer seem to come out at you is amazing
2 were ordered and one was defective amazon sent a new one immediatley and the defectiove one was returned at no charge for postsge no further billing or credit
robert sabuda is a gifted , gifted man these pop ups \( and the others he 's done \) are astonishing my first grade class literally gasped , oohed and aahed as i turned each new page they ask me to read the pop up books at least once a week and , i read them myself even after the kids have gone home for the day what a treasure these books are
i shared this with my first graders today and all nineteen of them could barely sit still it is a beautiful book and the children absolutely loved it robert sabuda 's twelve days of christmas got the same reactions they are amazing books and i highly recommend them to other teachers , even up to third grade the children could not wait for me to turn the pages in 16 years of teaching i 've never had books that got reactions like these did ! i'm definitely ordering more the kids would never forgive me if i did n't
we read this on christmas eve and my kids love it this book is a work of art worth every penny
this book is fantastic ! ! i bought it for my grandkids and kept it for myself
this beautiful book takes an old christmas favorite and turns it into a book to be treasured for many years the striking popout art enhanses the story in a magical way
wow ! , this book is a master peice of art and wonder i play santa claus for enjoyment and the response i received this year was unbeivable from young to old each page would come to life before the audience i would read too the breath taking response was overwheling to me this book is in a catagory of it 's own ! the joy of those who encountered this book every time i would read it , made it worth while every time if you buy it , you will not be disapointed
clement moore 's night before christmas gets an almost origami pop up treatment engineered to be as sophisticated as it is adorable magically designed , value priced and thoughtfully executed it is sturdy but it really is art and not for very young children without supervision
excellent book for anyone interested in working for a nonprofit organization and anyone who will someday want to start one of their own
i recomend this book to every new mom it explains everything that is happening and i knew what to expect before i went to my dr 's appointment it told me things my doctor did n't
my wife and i receieved this book as a gift when we announced her pregnancy it is by far our favorite pregnancy book the week by week format is perfect for following along with your progress and also makes it nice to read together there are even helpful hints for dads along the way
when i was pregnant my first time , i carried this around everywhere ! i was hungry for knowledge and this seemed to be the only book that i could refer to more frequently than just the month to month ! i had wished that there was a day to day book , but this came very close to providing me with new information as frequently as possible it is a staple of the pregnancy book diet !
i absolutely love this book i grabbed a pile of books at the bookstore and looked through each one carefully before selecting this one it is the only best selling guide written by a doctor with millions of copies sold and i know why now that i own it ! ! i do n't see the negative like some readers do it is written by a doctor , so it provides a lot of info that you 'd get by talking with your doctor every day ! so there are things that you should know about even if you do n't want to hear it or do n't think it will happen to you ! it explains things such as bleeding during pregnancy , some common medications to avoid to prevent birth defects , pollutants to avoid and why , stds during pregnancy , nutrition and sources serving sizes , how your actions affect your baby 's development \( vaccinations , smoking , xray , falling , safety , etc \) , possible tests , required tests , lying on your back , rh sensitivity , douching , sex , backaches , exercise guidelines , air travel , car safety , breastfeeding , pregnancy discomforts \( hemmorhoids , constipation , backaches , foot swelling , dizziness , breast itching , cramping , contractions \) , infections , hot tubs , jaundice it really is like having a doctor 's advice for each week of your pregnancy it relieved alot of the worrying about symptoms i was experiencing , realizing that i was normal
the greatest strength of this book is the week by week format it outlines specific changes that are pretty close to exactly as predicted we noticed many of the things and then read them that week , ie phlegmyness , inability to travel more than an hour and dryness at night just to name a few this book is very well balanced and it tends to focuses more on the positives of pregnancy and not the possible complications this is the 5th edition of this book with millions of copies sold overall it is a great help i definitely recommend it to all expectant couples these authors also wrote a number of supporting or complimentary books
this book is appalling it is disempowering to women , providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births \( with no reference to back it up \) , and generally gives a do n't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you attitude even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby
ok , so there might be some parts that are negative , but really how cool is it to tell your husband , partner , whatever that this week the ears will be growing and the baby will be able to start to hear things or the baby is now the size of a peanut look at the scaled drawing in the book of what our baby looks like ! i think that this is a great book always take things with a grain of salt , but this book rocks i buy it for all my friends that are having babies very informative , and the pics are really cool i thought this was the best book , way better that what to expect when you are expecting yuck !
i know that no book can cover every topic , but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases , but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness , which is much more common
this book is almost entirely week by week description , so the information is detailed i especially liked the dad tips that are included with each week there is also a tiny section on labor and lists of common events for the first several post partum weeks i liked the simple writing style , but i often did not find the extra information for each week relevent to what i was going through at the time i prefer you and your baby pregnancy your ultimate week by week by dr laura riley
we have this and the bible of maternity books , what to expect when you 're expecting but we may have well just thrown the other one away this book is great each weeks there is information on how your baby is developing many weeks have illustrations depicting what the baby might look like info on the size and development of the baby and what changes are happening to the mother 's body there are plenty of facts on things like nutrition and warning signs and symptions of disease and my wife 's personal favorite was the dad tip each week it really is a well written book it does n't overload you on information but keeps you aware of the mother 's changing body and the development of the baby a must have for any mother or father out there
my wife 's addiction to the home shopping network was putting a real strain on our savings account all the money that we had set aside for our son 's community college education was lost after a sale of the century on commemorative prince charles and camilla parker bowles plates instead of buying one plate \( like most people \) , my wife decided to get a 12 piece set \( to match the 12 piece set of bill and hilary clinton cutlery , i guess \) normally , the plates would n't be that expensive , but these were the ones with the 14 karat gold border the rest , as they say , is history
i have this book and it is weak as hell it does n't give you anything common sense ca n't figure out for you it does n't explain anything in great detail enough to help you out at all do n't waste your money try trial amp error shabam the moderately sober fat mac
how to pick pockets for fun and profit a magicians guide to pickpocket magic taught me everything i needed to know about the skills of pickpockets
big disappointment i expected this book to be hysterical her sense of humor is certainly different ! very shallow material
this is a very humorous and should be mandatory read for anyone over 50 ! ! it 's so true i did n't realize how universal these thoughts on aging are it 's a great christmas find for all of my friends who have not yet read it these things must happen to men also do they care as much as women
if you enjoy sharp prose , clever language , and insightful stories about our times , this book is for you be you man , woman , child , or monkey ! nice work nora
a few good things , but she 's lost her edge and i find it impossible to identify at all with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there , botoxed , massaged , pt ed
ever since heartburn \( the book \) i have been a rabid fan of ephron 's , purchasing and greedily devouring previous books she had written and waiting anxiously for the next i feel bad about my neck does not disappoint bring on more
nora ephron speaks to the female spirit she tells of many of the same problems i have , such as what to do with purses , or what type of purse to wear i found the book both informative and entertaining
thank you nora ephron for reminding me that honesty and humor are the best antidotes for sadness and regret
this book made me start thinking about my health problems i would recommend this book
add nora ephron to our list of turtleneck icons katherine hepburn and diane keaton katherine knew what she was doing rarely did we catch a glimpse of her neck and diane made us all proud in something 's gotta give , looking fabulous in all her mock turtles even when she told jack to cut it off nora has hit the nail on the head with this one from our feelings about purses \( and i'm not sure the manufacturers are n't somewhat to blame for our hatred of them i often picture purse designers howling with glee as they mis locate inner pockets or leave them out entirely or put in so many that we walk around the house looking for items to fill them up \) to hairstyle frustrations \( what does one do with smooth , silky hair that overnight becomes stiff and bristley or starts to grow in the most unlikely places \? \) i felt i was reading my own journal most of the time she lost me when she delved into the agony and ecstacy of new york apartment ownership and rent controls but , what the heck , it 's good for us ruralites to hear about the the trials of city living i loved this book it 's short and a quick read and the perfect aging girlfriend gift okay , nora now , please write another when hally met sally , sleepless in seattle or you 've got mail meg ryan is starting to wear turtlenecks , so time 's a'wastin' !
i 've read this book twice now the first time i was still using and the second when i quit it was a very comprehensive guide and i'm so glad i bought it thanks so much for the help jerry
i 've worked with jerry dorsman closely , and i wanted to share with you my personal high regards for jerry dorsman and his new book how to quit drugs for good i was fortunate enough to see jerry apply many of the methods he details in his book with real people in real settings jerry is not a one track thinker and is aware that different strokes work for different folks the purpose of his book is to highlight the whole spectrum of treatments available for addictions so that the reader can better select a treatment more suitable to their unique needs it is a comprehensive manual that goes into detail about all drugs , their effects , and effective treatments and therapies available one would do very well in selecting this book to help themselves or as a manual in helping others in the field of addictions treatment i found his first book how to quit drinking without aa an essential tool in my own counseling experiences it was so incredibly useful from a concrete treatment perspective that i referenced it in my own treatment plan development i saw great results , and i stand by that that 's all i needed to see now i recommend all his books , because he cuts right to the chase without all the fluff when you 're in trouble , you do n't want to waste time you want to know what to do and how as soon as you can this book is not the cure , but it 's the best stepping stone to the cure only you can provide trust me on this
to be honest , i still have n't finished this book i keep it next to my bed for when i feel most alone try to keep the amounts i do read to a bare minimum because i never want it to end this collection of letters captures so many sides of buk his business side , his harsh side but also a great deal of his sensitive , sad , depressive but loving side , that is refreshing to see in any man , let alone one with such a weathered face i just ca n't help but love him
this is a wonderful story and is told in such a way that it makes you feel like you 're right there in the midst of it beautifully and realistically written , and you do n't want to put it down
background
not much to add to the great reviews i have read here since reading this book myself if you are intrigued or just interested in man agains the elements \( and losing \) this is one more to add to your reading musts
isaac 's storm by erik larsen is a compelling read it 's the story of the events leading up to the 1900 hurricane that devastated galveston , texas the time was so different today we 're starting to see the results of our indiscriminate destruction of the environment in the melting of the polar caps and global warming in 1900 , meteorologists were of the belief that someday they would be able to control the weather , stop hail , start rain , there was nothing they could n't do and they hoarded their responsibility and priviledge from any who might disagree into this political climate blew a storm that would change not only an entire city , but national weather bureau , but especially the people who lived through it larsen does an excellent job of building the timeline by focusing on just a few people to tell the tragedy occasionally he uses the tired technique of ending a chapter on a cliffhanger to heighten and maintain interest it 's not necessary the story is powerful enough with cheesy literary devices my only other complaint about the book is the lack of photographs while it sounds gruesome , pictures of the city before and after the hurricane would help heighten the story the isaac in the title is isaac cline , head of the national weather bureau at the time who ignored the signs of the city 's impending doom and suffered for it personally in many ways this is a horrible story that still holds lessons for us today
this book does well to explain the anatomy of a hurricane and the damage it can do erik larson illustrated the stories of so many as if he were right there with them
i must admit that i normally am not drawn to books about natural disasters , yet after seeing a documentary on the galveston hurricane and finding this book , my curiosity overcame me also , i had recently read and enjoyed larson 's book the devil in the white city and felt certain that he would be a thorough and more than competent narrator to tell this story i must also admit that recent natural disasters only heightened my interest in the storm that is considered the deadliest hurricane in history
overall very interesting and nice historical book even though the pov 's shift rather awkwardly and seem disjointed at times the book also provides a good narration of the competition between the cuban and american meteorological services
it seems that today people are becoming more aware of the danger that hurricanes pose , especially after the gulf 's devestation from katrina , wilma , and rita the four hurricanes to strike the florida coast in 2004 , and now cyclone larry which devestated northern queensland , australia hurricanes are becoming a much talked about and even debatable topic of how to prepare , track , and live with these storms that are now on the rise
i listened to isaac 's storm on cd while painting a room , and it made the time fly ! the cd rendition was clearly spoken and had excellent production value that said , i also loved the story i am a weather hound , and i enjoyed the detail of the way in which the nation maintained it 's weather bureau \( i had recently read the children 's blizzard and i would consider this as a nice companion book for we weather hounds \) the descriptions from survivors was threaded effectively along with a panoramic view of the galveston tragedy i have not read the book , but i found the cd riveting

savagely funny and pointed , dicker pulls no punches in his crystalization of the walmart juggernaut as it seeks to dominate a retail landscape near you
i will admit right up front that john dicker has written a clearly biased book against wal mart he is out to expose all that is bad about wal mart and is reluctant to point out any good things about wal mart \( if there even are any \) that being said , there are plenty of bad things to write about , and dicker covers them all the poor wages , forcing stores on communities that do n't want one , foreign sweat shops , putting local small businesses out of business , and practicing censorship by not selling cds and other items that do n't mesh with the family friendly image of wal mart the quintessential problem with wal mart is that with every charge that is thrown at it , it views the each problem as a public relations matter and think that they need to work on adjusting their image , not their behavior
wal mart is having a profound effect on our world this book is intelligent and well written it 's easy to read and very compelling hopefully it will have a very large audience keep an open mind the life you save may be your own
mr dicker seems to believe that peppering his text with foul language gives his work an edge i ca n't decide if he is just trying to be hip , urbane or if his vocabulary is so limited he has no other option
this book by author researcher john dicker criticizes the growing retail domination of the mammoth chain store , wal mart he argues that it has destroyed , and continues to crush , smaller local companies like toys 'r us , vons , etc by exploiting workers through very low wages dicker presents many credible points throughout his book and lists the various references for his extensive source material
we do n't have a wal mart in our area yet but it 's coming soon i will be honest i picked this book up out of curiousity it seems that wal mart is everyone 's favorite new bashing toy no matter how many people i know work there the author has had me intrigued from the first page on
this book uses the information that is a matter of public record to examine the phenomenon of wal mart as the author says early on there are no secret memos revealed or other shocking new information unfortunately this means that there are so many other things he does n't report that being said however , this book is almost too small for what it contains he could have easily written a book 3 times the size with a little more in depth work the author does jump from one topic to the next pretty quickly so be prepared to keep up
this book is the only one of twelve editions that i have read it is absolutely amazing not only does it question our common place world but it bends , strechtes and recreates you mind i am looking to buy the book so i can read it all and have the stories at my finger tips i am also going to read the next editions try one story , you will be hooked
this book clearly illustrates the need to be disciplined as an investor unfortunately , as many americans do not exercise this discipline they will never achieve the potential returns that can be had in the market this book should be mandatory for all students to read and study probably at the high school level
stocks for the long run the definitive guide to financial market returns and long term investment strategies jeremy j siegel
when you are done with this book , do not loan it to anybody i lost my first copy when an intern did not return it i lost the next copy when a friend gave it to his mom
this is a helpful book for novice investors and those more experienced the main point he makes is that in the long run , stocks are the safest investment , the best hedge against inflation , better than bonds or money market accounts this book is very valuable for siegel 's detailed historical research into the long term returns of stocks , and the causes of the big crashes and bull markets siegel explains well why interest rates are such an important indicator of market trends this book is mainly useful for devising an overall strategy to market investing rather than help picking specific stocks siegel suggests that a buy and hold strategy is best highly recommended
this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money page 364 principles of long term investing chapter 8 shows that among the s p 500 index returns , large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks now look at chapter 8 of the 10 largest corporations , only 2 \( exxon mobile and citigroup \) are value stocks duuhhh now i know what to do i have a choice of two stocks if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket , buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart if you know little , it wo n't add to your knowledge at all
there are a lot of books out there that try to tell you how to make money in the stock market this one accomplishes something else by giving quite a bit of history of market performance and explaining why stocks performed as they did over multiple time periods , siegel gives the reader a basis for understanding how and why stocks respond to different inputs
i read everything that jeremy writes he is simply the best researcher on equity investing alive today every fact in the book is extremely well researched , i imagine helped out by a team of eager finance students at wharton , the best finance school in the world this book gives even novice investors a very readable broad based knowledge set for investing it also proves that equities should be the foundation of everyones long term investment portfolio his other more recent book the future for investors is also a must read i have bought both of these books for everyone in my family and have told them if they want to build wealth they will read these books
this book seems to be a direct descendant of edgar smith 's common stocks as long term investments , first published in 1924
siegel 's book is considered the one book , next to graham 's intelligent investor , that all serious investors need to read and reread i count myself a very fortunate investor for having changed my life by reading knowledgeable authors and applying what i learned with the same enthusiasm that i devote to great literature and revolutionary science
this book is not meant to teach you about investing schemes as much as to validate the old known fact that equity markets beat anything else as an investing vehicle the book is dedicated to illustrate to readers the ultimate message patience is the vertue great outline charts to illustarte stocks advantage against any investment mechanism in the long run the author also advised readers to implement a definsive style approach by investing in index funds to take advantage of the low managemenr fee and to mimic the broader market which he found to reflect around 12 in the past 200 years
the book is an excellant study of small war tactics through israel 's occupation of lebanon while i do n't agree with the u s allied with israel this is still an outstanding overview of the way israel fights its wars
this is a solid , and lengthy study of the arab israeli conflict the reader benefits from the author 's inside knowledge of the topic for sure that said , this is not a short history of the subject those seeking that will not find it here this is primarily a military history those seeking more social and political perspectives will not find too much of that here this is basically a chronogical study of the various arab israeli wars from 1948 to the present the author does a fine job describing each event in good detail his inside knowledge provides an authoritative approach to the subject the narrative is also clearly written and easy to read there is more than a slight pro israeli bias , but it is not distorting herzog credits the arabs on occasion , and reserves his own political views for the most part he is often much harder on israeli set backs than he is on the arabs this in itself implies in his bias that more is expected from the idf than its opponets for a comprehenive military history of the arab israeli conflict this is a must read those seeking a more general approach should look elsewhere
this book offers a detailed look at the tactical and operational level it does not offer much for the strategic level nor does it contain a lot of interviews in the i was there mode this book tells you what this company battalion brigade was doing and why i do n't think i am ranting if i say the author tilts towards the israeli view on events i read this book exactly for what it offers there are other books out there for the big picture i disagree strongly with a previous reviewer who described the book as tedious this book can be criticized but not for being tedious this is the israeli version of mellenthin 's panzer battles and that is how it should be taken
former israeli president chain herzog 's account of the wars conflicts between the state of israel and her arab neighbors is a riveting history the book covers almost every israeli military operation from 1948 2004 \( this refers to the most recent version updated by former israeli intelligence officer shlomo gazit \)
chaim herzog \( 1918 1997 \) who served as israel 's ambassador to the
this account of the wars of israel from the war of independence is written with fairness and a real attention to the facts herzog can fault israel , and is aware of mistakes but points out to the essentially defensive character of the jewish state 's major military actions as a participant in the war of independence and as the major commentator and in fact ' national spokesman' in the 1967 war he well understands israeli society from inside he has great military knowledge and shows this in detailed explanations of the battle considering however the tremendous drama of the events involved the work is a bit less humanly moving than it could have been had he written more personally about the major characters involved
mr herzogs book is a winner i have read it several times and find it informative he explains in great detail each conflict and also gives us many details of the events that occurred between each conflict i recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a clear understanding of this part of the world
after having read how to develop self confidence influence people by public speaking by dale carnegie , i genuinely feel compelled to write a brief review
i regularly give public talks , and am always looking for ways to improve my speaking and organizational abilities on a lark , i picked this up from a friend 's bookshelf , and simply could n't put it down , eventually buying my own copy it is n't only that the author offers highly useful , practical information regarding poise , confidence , and organization , but also writes with a level of skill that is truly rare i recommend this book not only to burgeoning and expert public speakers alike , but also to writers interested in reading truly masterful prose
very good book a page turner chalk full of great ideas
this is a very good book it kept me very interested and i read it in a few days it is full of stories and practical advice on how to speak
as one could expect from a expert in human interaction , dale carnegie wrote a clear and concise book on public speaking the book is very readable , with loads of practical examples , and with a fantastic summary after each chapter i am sure the book can be of help to the novice as for the expert speaker alike i gave the book 4 stars , because in my view only mind blowing books like carnegie 's how to win friends and influence people deserve the maximum of 5 stars
i am very pleased with this book although i have other books that touch upon some of the same topics , the expert 's guide to the baby years contains short chapters that get straight to the point each section is written by an expert in that specific field , so you know that you are getting the best information out there i highly recommend this book !
in this hectic world it is critical to have the most essential information concentrated into a fun and easy to digest form everyone has opinions and advice when it comes to babies , but this book extracts the most valuable pearls of wisdom from the experts whe know best i just ordered copies to give as gifts to all of my friends who have young ones or are soon expecting thanks to samantha ettus for keeping experts advice coming our way ! ! !
as an expecting first time mom , i have a lot on my mind and this book has helped me think through a lot of those concerns the expert 's guide to the baby years has given me fantastic insight into many of the issues i'm facing while pregnant and those i'm sure to face in the coming months and years it has been a lot of fun to read all of the topics such as how to choose a name , dress your baby and nurture your marriage this beautiful book would be a great gift , as i'm sure every new mom would benefit from and enjoy reading advice from the experts
this slim volume has a some nice features that make up for a lack of illustrations and model photos , including a clever pentagon template , tips for cutting equilateral triangles hexagons , and suggestions for cutting multiple pieces for the projects i especially enjoyed working with the triangle , simple square , and the spike ball modules , which i used to make solid , satisfying models the triangle edge module can be used to make a nice tetrahedron or an icosahedron \( which helped me see the relationship between that shape and a dodecahedron \) i skipped a couple of spiky models that required glue , but i was generally very pleased with the book
the perfect book to have an adventure with your mind you travel in this book has you would by closing your eyes and point a finger on a map to see where to go on your next trip totally random safe dates with yourself i keep this book close at hand for the moments when i think i need a little stimulation highly recommended
this book is a gem , a pearl for all visual arts aficionados it intrigues you , it provokes you , it challenges you into seeing and thinking from another perspective sideways you ca n't read it or even peruse it all in one sitting , but you will find yourself going to it again and again looking for some artistic stimuli and visual intelligence and wit
whenever i need to reset my thinking about a particular problem , this is the book i reach for it is essentially an entire book of prompts to get your mind moving again i find it an irreplaceable source of inspiration for new ideas
the art of looking sideways is fascinating a potpourri of different treasures , from written words to visual art after buying a copy used , i was so impressed that i bought seven more new copies , one for each of my adult kids i'm sorry i ca n't describe the book in more detail , but each page is a different detail if you want a wealth of well , just a wealth i recommend this book
the art of looking sideways alan fletcher is inspirational , intelligent , invigorating , and stimulating this book is a collage of witty text , images , metaphors , idioms , paradoxes , and humor
as an artist and designer i found this to be a most wonderful book the title is very appropriate the layout , text and pictures really challenge conventional thinking the book is huge and not really meant to be read in one sitting so do n't try i just keep mine of the coffee table and pick it up opening it to a random page everytime i always put it away with a new sense of vision and delight highly recommended for everyone excellent
i bought it for me and it is so amazing that i bought it twice as a gift for my friends ! !

this book is essentially a very inteligent scrapbook
this book is n't meant to be read from cover to cover \( it 's size is already a source of intimidation \) , but picked up from time to time , to surprise , to inspire , to entertain , to stimulate a collection so worth the money
this book is one of the most comprehensive latin books out it has nearly everything a latin student , like me , would need
it seems a little presumptuous to comment on this classic , but it would be much easier to use if the section numbers were given at the top of the pages \( like keywords in a dictionary \) since every reference in the index is by section number , the page numbers emphasized in the current design are extremely distracting there is no way to find a section number except by scanning the text i hope the publisher will read this review and change the design in a future edition
this book 's low average rating is , unfortunately , a reflection not of its quality , but of the error of a previous reviewer whose mistake was to expect the book to be a basic grammar rather than a reference grammar for more advanced students put simply , there is no better latin reference grammar available in english if there is , i am not aware of it this is the only latin grammar that rivals smyth 's greek grammar in its depth and clarity that said , students should note that this is a thorough descriptive reference grammar , not a grammar meant to teach latin or to provide the intermediate student with a basic reference those seeking a simpler reference more suitable to the intermediate level may benefit from bennet 's grammar of the same title
this is one of the great latin reference grammars where most people fail is in expecting a grammar to be a textbook case in point , another reviewer compared this to moreland and fleischer 's intensive latin course , which is a fine textbook , but not a reference grammar this and similar grammars by hale amp buck or gildersleeve are essential for the advancing student , but should never be approached like a lesson book or be read straight through they 're called reference grammars because you 're meant to refer to them on specific questions of grammar get it \? for the beginning student or for a simpler \( albeit less authoritative \) treatment , i recommend bennett 's grammar but allen amp greenough is an excellent , excellent grammar when you 've gotten a bit further along you may consider adding woodcock 's new latin syntax
i find it much more difficult to navigate this book than , say , moreland and fleisher 's book of latin grammar furthermore , it 's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate the author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation , relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion
i used this book when i was writing a thesis on austen the chapters are each broken into themes \( money , class , etc \) for easy reference , and there is an extensive index the book can be uneven because each chapter is written by a different author still , the authors represented are among the most prominent austen authorities in the world
look , i knew nick belane this story is real the characters are real anyone who says otherwise is insane or crazy see , nick and i drank together back in the day the book is mostly how it all happened they left me out because i wanted big money \( 25 \) bukowski would n't pay me so i told him , keep my name out of it then , or i 'll bust your sack
still 20 pages to go but this is one of the best bukowski books different from all the other novels and full of really strange and unreal things or real i really liked it , shame it 's coming to an end so fast
i saw a documentary on hank bukowski , and thought i 'd give him a day in court this was the only work of his available at the library , so this is what i sampled it 's crap a waste of time bukowski 's reputation certainly ca n't rest on this alone did he pull an esoteric fast one , and write this just for the initiated \? maybe the book still sucks
i first picked this up a year ago and did n't like it i think that 's because i 'd just read his powerful autobiographical novels post office and ham on rye and wanted more of the same pulp , bukowski 's last novel , was completed shortly before his death in 1994 and is more a work of fantasy an absurd detective tale written in classic hardboiled private eye style it 's a pageturner , and i 'd love to see it turned into a movie it starts when lady death hires private dick nick belane to ascertain the identity of someone she thinks is celine , who has somehow escaped her grasp bukowski 's celine is hilarious , a master of the put down more clients follow , in the best film noir tradition , but with bizarre and humorous twists belane 's association with lady death proves beneficial a number of times , but it is not without its price i could n't put this down and the ending is a gutwrencher running gags like belane 's high fee \( 6 an hour \) and his inability to get served in bars without a hassle prove buk 's masterful comic touch , while slice of life digressions take the reader places few writers go for instance , a space alien laments the earth smog , murder , the poisoned air , the poisoned water , the poisoned food , the hatred , the hopelessness , everything the only beautiful thing about the earth is the animals and now they are being killed off , soon they will be gone except for pet rats and race horses it 's so sad , no wonder you drink so much dedicated to bad writing , pulp is anything but
this was bukowski 's last published work before he died it 's an old fashioned detective novel , or a parody of one , and an allegory about a man getting ready to die it 's clever at best there are some great one liners at worst , it 's convoluted and easy taken in context of bukowski 's life , it 's a big middle finger to all the literary elitism bukowski despised but as a stand alone book , it 's little more than its title suggests pulp fluff and if you 're not interested in bukowski 's life , this book has little to offer
written as he was fighting the illness that would kill him , this is bukowski 's farewell to his readers as he said elsewhere of his hero cline , they ripped his guts out and he made them laugh and this is what he proceeds to to in pulp portraying himself as a blundering , idiotic detective , he pokes the ultimate fun at his own work as a writer he has n't even begun to solve any of the mysteries of life and yet he is about to die a meaningless death \( in the allegory , the lease on his office is expiring \) , surrounded by even worse clowns and failures than he is personifications of his earlier selves are also there \( the gambling addict mailman , see post office \) and he resolutely thrashes them in the most poignant self critique you 'll ever find anywhere believe it or not , this book is a sublime act of bravery in the face of insurmountable odds
this book is a final middle finger to all those who ca n't see it for what it is a last footnote to an incredible body of work dedicated to breaking the rules i thinks its rather entertaining way to go old man , i get it
first off , before picking up this book i was under the false impression that with old age bukowski would have lost his edge i think i felt this way because some one told me once to stick to his earlier works so i did this was usually the rule of thumb with most of the music i listen to , so i did n't see why it would n't apply to books anyway , a friend recently gave me a copy and i found myself really enjoying this book a lot sure it 's not like women where there 's a sex scene every page , but it still is written from the mind of a dirty man the book is a detective mystery where the dick takes on a bunch of really surreal mysteries that deal with sex , life , and death he gets most of his work done by doing nothing , and when he 's not doing so hot he kills time at the track or the bar which are classic bukowski settings i found that this book was surprisingly witty and had a lot of clever little twists throughout it that kepty me thoroughly entertained when i got to the part where the space aliens were introduced i thought the book would suddenly turn ridiculous , but it did n't it was really humorous and quite imaginative all in all , this book ranks right up there w post office and ham on rye for me it 's an amazing book , and deserves to be read by any buck fan
now do n't get me wrong , i'm a huge bukowski fan post office is a great novel and women is pretty damn good also , but this is just awful if this was his first ever novel , it would never have been published bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then i can believe why pulp , is just a very bad book the story is stupid , the plot is a mess , the characters are dumb the only good thing about it is it 's short it 's a shame to read something so bad from someone i used to love to read stay well away from this book , you will only be very disappointed
i bought this to give to my boyfriend for his birthday thankfully we broke up before it rolled around what a bonus for me ! ! this is the best collection of the best comic strip ever written
calvin hobbes is far and away the best comic strip ever , and i looked forward to getting this set for quite some time if it were n't for the problems described below , i 'd give this set 5 stars but , i have several issues with the production quality
this was a splurge purchase for us and the best hundred bucks or thereabouts we 've spent in a long time the intro is fascinating and the comics , reproduced full size , rather than the shrunken newspaper versions , are brilliant we have no problems getting our son up in the mornings as he relishes the prospect of reading calvin hobbes once he is ready for school he ca n't wait for it to snow so that we can fill the yard with snow goons go on go mad and treat yourself
calvin and hobbes is possibly and arguably the greatest comic strip ever drawn their adventures are what every kid has gone through , with all the humor in tact
c h is simply the best comic i 've ever read i already had 3 anthologies , but this was completely worth it the extra stuff in the anthologies \( e g calvin turns into and elephant , something under the bed is drooling , etc \) is in here too the books are very nice , thick paper , and the original publishing dates are on each page
everyone in my family loves calvin hobbes my younger son has wanted this collection for a long time so this year on his birthday i bought it for him it arrived in perfect condition it weighs a ton , and i think that adds to the charm of it my son says each book is a tome he is thrilled
i do n't understand how a product of this quality and size can be this cheap ! i bought it as a gift for my wifes 30th birthday , and she was very happy some of the guests at the party showed a lot of greed though \)
it arrived in great condition , and was a timely turnaround as well
it 's virtually unheard of for a book publisher to treat a comic strip with the sort of reverence demonstrated in the complete calvin and hobbes beautifully arranged and reproduced strips even preserve the context of the daily strip size against the pure white of the paper here are three volumes which provide years of reading and re reading , and a perfect gift for future generations who will never have been exposed to bill watterson and his brilliant creations

wow what a book , and what a writer after i read the books about mma ramotswe and her friends i bought this book about the funny dr von igelfeld and i enjoyed it from page one the absurd problems dr von igelfeld is facing , is enjoyable to read and puts a smile on your face while you 're reading this book
in the finer points of sausage dogs , alexander mccall smith has written a wry and worthy sequel to portuguese irregular verbs the humor here is extremely dry , but the results are absolutely delicious
von igelfeld has got to be one of the most pompous and endearing characters that i have ever read he has to give a lecture on a subject he knows nothing about and then he goes on a mission for a member of the coptic church
the unlikely adventures of professor dr moritz maria von igelfeld continue in this collection of five stories by alexander mccall smith the finer points of sausage dogs finds our hero the renowned author of that philological masterwork portuguese irregular verbs lecturing on the subject of veterinary medicine at the university of arkansas \( the finer points of sausage dogs \) , evading man hungry widows on board a cruise ship \( the perfect imperfect \) , and hobnobbing with vatican bigwigs while vacationing in italy \( the bones of father christmas \) his relationship with his nemesis , dr detlev amadeus unterholzer \( the author of a study on the portuguese imperfect subjunctive , which is not , however , as fine a piece of scholarship as igelfeld 's own monograph \) , deepens in the course of these stories , despite igelfeld 's unwonted involvement with sausage dogs and as a direct result of the aforementioned widows
professor von igelfeld stumbles upon a series of short adventures , mostly dealing \( oddly \) with a dachshound of particular fun was the canine surgery it was a hoot throughout the stories , his intellectually inferior colleague unterholzer receives praise that igelfeld thinks is due to him the final episode involves igelfeld chasing off a swarm of middle aged widows who discover he is the only single man available on a meditarrean cruise ship
if alexander mccall smith had stopped with mma romotswe 's series , he would have gone far to prove he 's a great writer with insight into human nature and a fabulous sense of humor
this book is very funny my friend let me borrow his copy one day and i fell in love with this book the jokes are very subtle and lots of times absurd this book is not for everyone as stated below but is incredibly funny
no one should read this book thinking it 's part of the botswana books i also recommend that you read portuguese irregular verbs first without that background , the humor here wo n't work as well
portuguese irregular verbs is the setup and the finer point of sausage dogs is the payoff you get to know prof von iglefeld and his cronies in the first book , which helps you laugh even more reading about sausage dogs and other absurdities of course if you want to laugh out loud , 44 scotland street is the model i had to read most of it out loud on a 1400 mile ferry trip up the coast of alaska last summer
any author who can make me laugh out loud deserves a medal give alexander mccall smith at least two ! i was giggling through this second book in the professor series absurdities galore , wonderfully quirky characters , and adventure after adventure for our darling herr dr professor von igelsfeld
all too infrequently i find myself in the fortunate possession of a book too interesting to put down the fate of the corps is one of those books the other books i 've read regarding the corps of discovery 's expedition c always left me wondering what became of the less well known members this book tells their story in a highly readable and captivating way
the book contains outstanding personal histories of every individual that left a record after their return to st louis some of the amazing men include john colter who left the corps on the return leg after three years with lewis and clark to turn back northwest with a small group of trappers like george drouilliard , colter spends time in the remote country in constant danger from the powerful blackfeet although only one man died on the lewis and clark expedition , many of the men that return meet death at the hands of the indians or natural diseases of that era george shannon , loses a leg in a second trip north and becomes quite successful , some like nathaniel pryor virtually live with the indians \( osage \) and a few live a very long life like patrick gass their lives intersect such famous mountain men such as jedediah smith , hugh glass , young jim bridger and the controversial edward rose the author has done phenomenal research that documents all the corps participants including the death of sacagawea , although there is some controversy noted in the appendix her husband charbonneau lives a long life that is quite useful , in spite of lewis' opinion , for others plying the missouri of course clark 's life is well documented and known but clark did a wonderful job keeping up with the survivors actually maintaining a log on all participants up through the late 1820 's of course , there is a lengthy chapter on the mysterious death of lewis on the natchez trail and the author includes three notable letters on the death james neelly 's , the indian agent who traveled with lewis , lewis' educated friend wilson who interviewed the only witness a year later , and the last from an unknown school teacher who interviews mrs grinder one last time many years after many of the men of the corps witness notable historic events such as the great earthquake that destroys new madrid , the stout resistance and attacks by the arikara , other indian uprisings and the war of 1812 the author even includes lengthy detail on what happened to charbonneau and sacagawea 's son a very satisfying book that anyone with more than a passing interest in lewis and clark and those resourceful explorers will well enjoy
ok , it 's another lewis and clark title but with a big difference the fate of the corps what became of the lewis and clark explorers after the expedition does n't rehash or re follow the expedition it discusses the ultimate fate of the thirty plus members of the corps of discovery which constituted lewis and clark 's force original research blends with past scholarship to survey life after the expedition ended in 1806 , up to the final death of the last corps member in 1870 myth and reality regarding the ultimate fates of john colter , sacagawea , and others are revealed in a scholarly yet lively survey
though this book explains what happened to the members of the expedition after they came back , it is more than that it gives their backgrounds as well as their fates and puts them in a human context i am better acquainted with each of them from reading this book than from the journals and all of the historical references put together this book makes a great gift , though after you read it , you might not want to give it away
do n't let the size of the book fool you just because it does n't take an encyclopedia sized book to get her ideas across does not mean they are n't profound , easy to internalize , and life changing
as a psychologist , researcher and lecturer the author shares
i have several home organization and storage books , but this is the only one that i have actually read cover to cover at first , when i got it , it was smaller than i was imagining and it had no pictures , so i thought i would n't like it i was wrong ! it gives ideas that make you maintain an organized house without much effort , once the initial setup of the suggested organizing ideas and techniques is in place this book confirmed some of the things i was already doing that worked , it gave me new ideas and it helped me refine some that i already had in place a quick and easy read and definitely suggested
i found kathy kendall tackett 's book , the well ordered home an extremely helpful , easy read book i do n't have hours of spare time to read lengthy diatribes that i ca n't remember five minutes after putting the book down i prefer the two pages a read kind of book , with common sense advice that i can apply the minute i stop reading , even at the midnight hour this book is that kind of helpful tool it 's so much easier to follow someone who has been there and blazed the trail kathy leads me by the hand and gives me practical ways to get the job done in sprints as well as long distance runs she anticipates my excuses for not tackling a job and addresses them before i whine them forth as i finished each chapter , i said , i can do that ! and i did well , except for the garment groomer and lint roller think i can get it at walmart \? thanks , kathy !
this book has become a permanent fixture at the breakfast spot on my kitchen table it could easily be titled how to eat an elephant every few days , i open to a different page and find out how to make my life sane the author has done a great job of helping me approach very difficult household tasks and become good at them this is after all another skill those of us who are not obsessively compulsive need to learn in order to survive life on the edge ! so far her ideas have gone down better and have saved me real time and real money by not having to re buy what i know i have already bought but ca n't could n't find if you had a gun to my head ! her writing style is crisp and light and she approaches the negative emotion of why these tasks are so distasteful as you read you feel she is right there at your kitchen table to help you through the tough spots enjoy
for all the women of my generation who are confused and frustrated by the millions of options and pitfalls involved in combining career , family and self , this book is a strong answer to those questions peters writes clearly and well about the encouraging possibility that we can do everything we want without sacrificing ourselves , our families , or our careers sound impossible \? that 's because we 've been brainwashed by the generations before us to believe that we must either be workaholics or stay at home mom thanks to peters , we can now remember that there is a balance between them
i loved this book could not put it down a terrific book with wonderful characters a blend of suspense and romance another gem
i bought the book because i enjoy evrything that debbie macomber writes i like her style of writing and was not dissapointed in this book i would also recommend her knitting club books
i deal with the aging population , an aging mother , and love gardening which is why i was immedialtly drawn to this book very realistic and heartwarming susannah finds herself sandwiched in between her aging mother and her young inexpirenced daughter who knows it all she tried to deal with the emotions alone of moving her mother into assisted living , feelings she had with her father who dies before she had dealt with unresolved issues from her own childhood , and her daughter also who is dealing with some similar issues susannah re developes friendships from her childhood , discovers lost love and respect for her parents i felt the ending was done very quickly and could have been finished with a little more information as she had given throughout the book
i was horribly disappointed in this book i look forward to debbie macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically
never having read macomber before , i picked up susannah with interest , hoping to discover the secret of her popularity while the premise of this book is a promising one , it never reached it 's potential susannah as a character is oh so nice , and for a woman in her 50 's , remarkably impetuous and self absorbed her husband joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing , and daughter chrissy , evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent , comes across as petulant and spoiled as so often happens with writers who turn out book after book , macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases \( e g , he wound his arm around her waist \) less than halfway through this story , its central mystery became transparently predictable , and in the final 30 pages , all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places
susannah nelson is n't happy she 's tired of teaching , frustrated with her daughter 's refusal to be more responsible about her life , worried about her aging mother , and now she 's having dreams about her high school boyfriend dreams she definitely ca n't share with her husband of twenty five years when she learns that her mother is having problems , she drops everything and heads from seattle to colville , in eastern washington only to find that her mother has lost weight , is having problems with her memory , and has been visited by her long dead husband
this book hits home for me as my mom has been in a nursing home for seven years ms macomber has hit the nail on the head as the role reversal scenes play themselves out i hope those who will be going through that phase of life will take notes and be prepared for it it 's not an easy task but it a rewarding one thank you , ms macomber
this book was easy enough to read , it just was n't what i expected from quindlen i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating , in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out the back and forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing , and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past , whereas the previous paragraph was present time although i got used to that writing style , i always found it annoying the storyline itself never sold me either a typical , young sew your wild oats boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the perfect father i just did not find such an occurrence likely and , as a mother myself , all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm anyway the whole story seemed far fetched and disjointed to me , and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many , many years
i too just loved this book ! i was n't expecting such beautiful prose from anna quindlan this is my first venture into her novels i am mostly familiar with her newsweek writings
in blessings , anna quindlen gives us a wonderful read it 's the story of two very different people , lydia blessing and skip cuddy lydia is a wealthy and difficult elderly woman who hires skip as a handyman on her estate she seems to have had it all , but actually her life has been filled with disappointments skip lives over the garage on the estate and is a hard worker mrs blessing constantly watches him as he moves around her property because she does n't really trust anyone , she uses binoculars to make sure he does his chores and keeps busy he is aware of her spying , but does n't hold it against her
loved it highly suggest it could n't put it down
blessings is one of those rare novels which takes a single word title into seven dimensions of meaning in a delightful story about family love
the book was very well writtem with great information on the amazing economy of china the book is a must read for anyone interested in business or economy fields
this book is similar to china shakes the world , although the latter is better written which is also why china shakes the world has won the 2006 ft goldman sachs business book of the year award
on this side of the pacific , we are seized every 20 years with a sublime terror , as we watch the rise of another monster in the east in the land of rising suns , tigers and dragons , the dragon is on the rise and , it seems , will remain so throughout the next century
for those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one , you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through the writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of china and its muscle power instead of branding china as a villain , we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains , china would n't be where it is now wal mart is covered in detail the writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing , it 's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when china has perfected its manufacturing bases just as japan and south korea had done before it then , there 's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located , and how china is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour china 's progress is n't simply detrimental to other countries on contrary , it benefits them as well for example , australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to china with increase of living standard in china , chinese needs more nutritious food as china could n't provide enough , united states particularly the middle states are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the middle kingdom then , there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping united states in check by siding with china , and also the love and hate relationship between usa and china of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in china and so forth whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided \( since china has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time \) , suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks yes , some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately , i think they are missing the points what 's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about china and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come highly recommended
this books offers a comprehensive overview of the china vs world \( western industrialized hemisphere \) dynamics fishman intentionally does not get into the guessing game of middle east india factors in the equation but offers global trends that are relevant to everyone who is curious about the business world around them what does it mean if a small fraction of chinese can , or are willing , to do x \? \( hint a small fraction of one billion , in absolute terms , is an exceptionally large number of people nonetheless ! \) how will adding over a billion of people to the commercial world around us affect our lives and our countries \? how can established companies make use of this new market \?
i have n't actually read the book , but the title says it all the author does n't understand economics !
mr fishman is straight forward in delivering the details about the rising economic giant no matter where you stand politically , socially or economically you are directly effected by current developments in china

jenny mccarthy is a truly gifted writer my sister gave me this book as a mothers day gift after having baby 2 jenny depicts the first year of mommyhood as realistic as you can get ! if you are expecting your first of fourth baby , you must read this book it 's so much fun and enjoyable , too
i bought this book for a friend not for me , a proud child free woman yet , i found myself unable to put it down jenny had me laughing so much , my stomach hurt ! while it may be coined as just a humor book , i think new moms may be able to learn a thing or two about their new role and what to expect during the first year of mommyhood
baby laughs is hysterical ! ! jenny has a fun way of looking at motherhood motherhood is a tough thing that people can be very critical about jenny 's laugh out loud view of motherhood helps moms not to take the criticism to heart great job jenny !
jenny mccarthy is so funny ! this is a must read book weather you are pregnant a new mom or have been one for years sometimes she 's so honest it 's scary but it deffintly does not freak you out about being a mom i highly recommend this book ! i 've just started reading life laughs by jenny mccarthy
i have never laughed out loud so much when reading a book i had to wipe away tears several times i was laughing so hard it is great for moms because we can relate to so much of what she writes
baby laughs was hilarious ! it 's comforting to know that even beautiful women such as mccarthy have those fat days and do n't always find the time to shave their legs my husband and i are expecting our first child in october so i 've been trying to get all the advice that i can i found this book to be a comic relief instead of the do n't do this and you ca n't do that 's , she weaves her experiences into hilarious images i laughed so hard i had tears
my mom just gave me this book for mother 's day and i read it with my husband we laughed to the point of tears ! this book is so much fun we are expecting our first child next month and of course have so many fears as first time parents i 've heard about giving birth , the suffering after birth , breastfeeding and your first few weeks of parenting from various people , but no one tells these stories like jenny you will be laughing throughout as it makes you feel more at ease and more excited about your little ones arrival this book makes a great gift
i love it so much that after high school i want to try bud s for myself to see i can do it i know it will be hard but i think i can make it
one of the things that reveals itself throughout the book is that dick 's writing style gets old if it was n't for the ongoing story in the warrior elite , i would have been bored with dick 's narrative in the finishing school , the pace is slackened due to the fact that the men are all bud s grads and have less to worry about it takes more patience to read and at times it feels like the pace is very slow another thing you 'll notice is that dick does n't reveal much about the details regarding finishing schools during bud s , people can actually see the candidates train in coronado and the suffering is no secret however , when they continue on , the training they get is much more classified this is understandable , but at that same time it feels like dick is talking much without revealing much for someone who wants the details , this was frustrating and took out a significant amount of my interest i have n't read the latest couch book on seals , but i hear it 's the same here 's an advice for mr couch do n't write a book that people will read for its details and not reveal anything better off waiting for several years and disclosing the info \( like haney 's delta force \) than beating around the bush on the other hand , you 'll get the big picture about what bud s grads do after bud s on their way to earn the trident
most of us have sipped our favorite adult beverage through one or two re runs of the tv programs documenting buds training
i am not going to repeat the strengths of the book which had been covered extensively by other reviewers i just want to add one more point on top of the details given by the author about how elite every seal \( only twelve sixteen man platoons of navy seals deployed around the world today \) and how tough the training are \( in particular the physical ones when you think of 500 push ups , 60 pull ups , 6 miles of running , all in a normal day , not to mention the 60 high attrition rate hell week that trainees , beside taking extra heavy duties , sleep only four to five hours for an entire week \) , the author , an ex seal , had emphasized throughout the book , insightfully , the soft elements that make up seals i also believe one of the strongest motivators is the desire to belong they want to be the best , and they want to serve with the best i also believe that success at bud s \( basic underwater demolition seal training \) , is based on intelligence the ability to think ahead and to clearly visualize one 's personal goals those who have a clear goal of where they are going , and know why they 're going there , are less likely to surrender mentally to the physical pain pg 19
if you 've read the warrior elite , you know what you 'll get in this book captain couch does a great job describing what happens from the day the bud s graduates are secure from coronado to the time they go on forward deployment with their seal platoons i especially liked that he offered details on both the officer and enlisted sides of things as a person hoping to secure an officer billet to bud s while maintaining a family , it was refreshing to see that others do it it also does justice to the modern seal and inadvertently dispels negative notions that the likes of marchinko and carracci have impressed on us the modern seal is above all a professional , like most of his processors , not a blood thirsty rambo like the previously mentioned would have you believe if you want to truly understand this world , read this book , if not go back to rouge warrior it 's pretty detailed and has a few pictures just like the last book on the negative side , i was left wanting more for the 25 00 hardcover price the 263 pages read more like 170 it 's worth the 5 stars i gave it , but i also felt it was not as complete a product as the warrior elite
anyone interested in learning about the navy seals should read couch 's works
most of the reviews that i have written for amazon are based on the books , the dvds , and the cds that i already own i occasionally buy a new product via amazon , but i mostly review the stuff that i already own
waiting for godot was dubbed a tragicomedy and there does n't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play the random and wandering personalities of vladimir and estragon , the main characters , lend an amusing air to the entire work however , their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy \( and irritation \) , though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you unless one goes into waiting for godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing , and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be knowing a little bit about beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable , but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own what i love the most about this book is beckett 's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality vladimir and estragon are most certainly not your average joe , but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous waiting for gogot is really what you make it , because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men , it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale go in looking for a meaning , and knowing how beckett means to get things across , and i think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold a short read , and worthwhile , i would say , at least for its originality and humor
samuel beckett 's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them is godot god \? are didi and gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive , or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering \?
some think waiting for godot is an argument for existentialism others believe it is about man 's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question neither seem correct
i'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with , but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work , however , is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel it 's akin to the random scribblings of a two year old or a mud splattered canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind , it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis , because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal though look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes and brilliant artistry of the play
waiting for godot is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork , in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value in this case , however , what is behind the artwork is a non concept , the impossibility of creating a masterpiece after the monumental impossibility of joyce 's finnegans wake , what remains for the serious artist \? waiting for godot is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world in that sense , this play is the last masterpiece of high art the torch has now passed to movies and popular forms
samuel beckett 's , soon to be classic , drama about two men , vlad and estro , transcends stage play drama beckett 's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic , literal story
many readers of 'waiting for godot' obsess about the identity of godot and whether he represents god or any other almighty being it is unlikely that beckett was referring to god as the man for whom the characters are waiting , as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in beckett 's theatre
waiting for godot , a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes , attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with it is a call to action this play is packed with nonsensical dialogue the plot does not exsist yet , once we realized that waiting for godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense at least in subtle ways much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality , but , that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century it 's enigmatic , a puzzle of words , poetry , and philosophy i recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge the play is short and does not take too much commitment take a quiet evening and give it a shot what are you waiting for
i work for a professional sports franchise \( but not baseball \) , and this book really helped me understand the issues surrounding a professional team this covers some major subjects , such as labor agreements , stadium financing , and broadcasting deals , by using major league baseball as an example anyone wanting to further their knowledge of how the economics of a professional sports league should grab this book
the information presented in this book is amazing the economics of baseball are hardly talked about there are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us do n't know about it was fascinating to find out about this , but it got to be too much for me to handle i ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why i gave it two stars i also disagree with some of zimbalist 's theories on how to reform baseball he is not open to any other ways , and i should know since i met him once for a seminar
i had read somewhere that the woman in white was the original mystery novel and was the classic to measure all later ones by after a slow start i became very engaged with the subtle clues and flowery vocabulary the book is a chance to experience a victorian past that adds a special touch to an interesting story
first serialized in 1859 , and then published as a novel in 1860 , the woman in white , by wilkie collins , tellingly , has never been out of print since the time of our civil war
this engaging mystery pits three idealistic young people in the traps of larcenous , black hearted villians a mysterious woman in white encournters walter hartright , a young drawing master on his way to a new commission in the country from then on , it seems that their fate and lives are tangled together , this woman in white , and walter and his pupils marian halcombe and laura fairlie at first it seemed like a lighthearted curiosity , that marian searches for in her mother 's letters , just a childhood acquaintance the first few months at limmeridge , the fairlie 's mansion , walter hartright , marian halcombe and laura fairlie spend a happy companionable season as drawing master and pupils , with not a worry in their heads but the beautiful nature scenes , walks in the gardens and contemplation of the blue sky that is , until laura 's impending marriage to sir percival glyde draws a gloomy end to their idyllic days from then on , the pace quickens as the woman in white first sends a letter of warning to laura , and then later , lurks around attempting to deliver a secret to laura , only to be foiled by the maneuverings of an elderly corpulent count who has allied himself with sir percival glyde
i read this book in one day , a day where no classes were attended , no phone calls were taken , and no visits made i cooked and ate my food with it in hand , and sometimes damned my inability to read faster , i was so eager to find out what was going to happen next
a great great novel ! catches you from the beginning and does n't let go you become obsessed and engrossed collins has the most gorgeous way of writing drawing you in and his descriptive ability is astounding
this advice for writing serial romances , alternately attributed to wilkie collins , charles dickens , and charles reade , is epitomized in this 1860 novel by collins , a story of thwarted love , a marriage of obligation , claims on inheritance , the victimization of women , and , most of all , engaging mystery collins , often credited as the father of the mystery genre , creates a fast paced story of victorian england , revealing much about victorian society and its values the role of women , the laws governing marriage and inheritance , the social institutions of the day , the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes , and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness
i enjoy reading mysteries and have read quite a few in my time , but i 've never before come across anything like the woman in white i'm always a little skeptical when i hear a book being described as a page turner but that description fits this novel to a tee i found it very hard to find a stopping place each evening and lost more than a few hours of sleep , but it was definitely worth every minute !
though the language is contemporary for its time \( 1860 \) , and it is written in the style of a serial \( thus in the author 's interest to make it extend out a bit \) , this is a good story the plot device is quite inventive , the story gets better in the second half , and the final chapters are quite entertaining
i really liked this book it had a romantic appeal and vivid , memorable characters the plot was also fantastic wilkie wrapped up everything quite nicely at the end i wo n't say anymore for those who have n't read it i did n't feel there were any unbelievable coincidences in the plot it was a little slow at first , but once i got into it , i could n't put it down some parts were hilarious this book has it all i would definitely recommend it
i think terry frei did a fantastic recounting events of something that happened 60 years ago clearly mr frei did a thorough job researching all the events and the many characters he references as for the reader , he she is taken on a journey about teenagers turning into young men during one of the most difficult times in american history frei goes into great detail about the wisconsin badger roster and characters that make it up at times , it does get confusing but i honestly do n't see how frei could have singled anyone out except for perhaps dave schreiner i will admit i skipped some of the middle of book when the author gives a recap of all the badger games from 1942 the second half of the book \( about the war \) is very well done in fact , the second half of the book is a real page tuner all in all , it is a good book about some fine people that i would have loved to have met
through exhaustive research and interviews with the remaining badgers , their families , and combat comrades , frei tells the story of this team of young men who became real life heroes by fulfilling a much greater calling in describing their experiences on the football field and in service to their country , frei makes it clear why the generation young men and women who came of age during the second world war have become known simply as the greatest
great job so good that i was brought to tears so good that i almost need to visit the cemetery in lancaster , wis , and say thanks to dave schreiner and mark hoskins thanks to you , terry , for the idea , the research , the writing i rank your book up there with flags of our fathers and you were correct in advising your readers to ask questions , and more questions , of their parents i look forward to terry 's next book and plan to read his previous one
third down and a war to go is a page turner which chronicles the 1942 university of wisconsin all star football team and its college years , heroic service in world war ii , and return to unsung ordinary lives it was a different era for college football players actually wanted an education the majority were less than six feet tall and weighed less than 200 pounds what scholarships they received were so meager that even the all americans washed dishes and waited table there was no question about them interrupting college and collegiate football to serve their country some selflessly gave their lives but most returned , played some more football , and contributed to america 's post war recovery as lawyers , teachers , real estate agents , and jerry frei , the author 's father , as a college and pro football coach most never discussed their war service and certainly did n't consider themselves the greatest generation
the author was inspired after talking to his dad , a guard for the badgers and later a pilot many of the players suited up for the badgers and later departed for the battlefields
this book appeals to readers from many different angles i bought one for the history lover in the family , and another for a friend who enjoys tales of war this is to say nothing about the football and human interest stories that are intertwined as well
admittedly , i'm biased , because the 1942 wisconsin badgers won the first football game i ever saw and what a way to get a kid started it was one of those times when , briefly , it all came together heartland guys who hailed from small towns and cities and who played an extraordinary game of football for the university of wisconsin in madison names like elroy hirsh , pat harder , dave schreiner still resonate sadly the war put an end to this magic , and tragically some of the guys never made it back to pick up where they 'd left off sportswriter terry frei , son of the late '42 badger jerry frei , has done a remarkable job of reporting the drama and the triumphs of the season and the dedication and inevitable heartbreak that marked the war years but despite the focus of this cleverly titled book , do n't be fooled this is an all america story
so many had raved about this to me , on the web and in the media i did n't know if it could live up to all of that it was even better than i expected the friendships , the campus atmosphere in the first year of the war , the great football season involving famous players \( crazy legs \) and a famous coach \( four horseman \) , and then the war experiences ! when you get to the battle climaxes , you 're both feeling proud and ready to cry in places , and you 're also staggered because of the amount of research that had to go into this to find all of it out not to ruin the story , but this also shows why a lot of us wisconsin fans think david schreiner should be honored on the facade of camp randall stadium if you have n't heard of dave schreiner , you should talk about what this country is all about ! he 's it
by the other reviews here , you 'd think this was a marvelous sports war book fullof interesting , endearing characters performing in extraordinary times in fact , the book reads like a story from a friendly uncle who carries on and on about people you do n't know who he has n't made you care about there 's little to bond you to the characters , and much of the book explains the not particularly interesting game by game season of a wisconsin football team in the preface the autor relates how his father 's life inspired the book , and this feels like something someone would write for the benefit of the narrow group of people who experienced it , not the general public
this book is a great book for beginners who have never done anything like drama , it has a lot of great ideas on remembering lines and games to help kids work and work together it would be a good book for kids to read also it they are wanting to do drama or theatre or even the movies
i used this book to teach a summer drama class for a local daycare to grades 1st 5th the kids could n't get enough ! i used this book the whole summer , and it taught them how to work togather , even with their age differences
i was actually looking for kids monologue and scene books , but this book caught my attention , because of the good reviews , and i ordered it as well it is fantastic ! ! some old favourite theatre games i 'd forgoten and lots of new fun ones ! ! also curriculum ideas for classes beyond theatre games i ca n't wait to teach my class today using these new tools ! i 'll be using this book for along time
great book well written , easy to follow exercises ! lisa bany winters has written a highly comprehensive and interactive book packed full of theater exercises with great tips for additions to each exercise this book is terrific for elementary school teachers , camp activity leaders , children 's parties and of course , children 's drama instructors i highly recommend this book to anyone who knows a wanna be star
this book had such a wide variety of games and alot of ones i had n't even seen before i do recommend this book
mrs bany winters writes a great book ! i 've tried all of the theatre games and they are all very fun to do even if you are n't into theatre ! i recommend this book to everyone try it at parties , try it by yourself , try with friends just try it
i teach theatre courses for all ages of kids , and this is the book that i turn to most often for quick ideas the illustrations and explanations are clear as day and the games themselves are alot of fun
i run the independent theatre workshop a theatre school for tots to teens in dublin , ireland and i am always on the lookout for material for my drama classes i found this book easy to read and easy to use many 'teaching' books are so long winded that you never get far into them this book follows a clear and logical path taking the young actor from the very basics , through to more complicated improvisations and short scripts in a fun and imaginative way i often pick up this book and open it at random to select a game or excercise there and then with great results ! the instructions are clear and reader friendly and although every game and activity has a specific 'lesson' to teach , they all without exception actually work with children a rare quality in this day and age when children know what they do and do n't like and are n't shy about letting you know it ! this is also the perfect book for the non drama teacher to use to introduce drama into the classroom excellent for use with all children from 7 12 years \( although my teens and young adults love the stuff too !
this book is a perfect introduction to volcanoes for k 2 level kids , and older kids or early readers may enjoy reading them alone it is easy to understand and the illustrations are clear and nice looking unlike some science books for kids , this series tends to be very readable , versus a drier text that may make some kids lose interest quickly
the book was very good my son just started second grade and he loves science the book kept him very interested throughout he has read it more than 5 times and continues to ask questions about the different new concepts that were introduced in the book
as always with an elie wiesel book , the topic of the holocaust and its aftershocks are explored in lyrical depth the forgotten is no different , as it explores the memories of elhanan rosenbaum , just as he struggles with losing his memory to an incurable disease he desperately tries to pass his memories onto his son so that they will never die , even if he does
the forgotten explores both the holocaust experiences of the aging father , and his new horror of losing his memory both are intensely moving , whether seen through his own eyes , or those of his son struggling to fulfill a difficult obligation like all of elie wiesel 's writings , this book stays with you and influences your own thinking on many topics a sad story , unforgettable
i first read this in high school , in a single afternoon in a friend 's car in the school parking lot i loved it then and it 's as good as i remember it knowles was a first rate writer he chose interesting subjects and fully developed his characters , and his command of the english language was second to no one i recommend this book to everyone who loves to read good writing
this was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said
i had to read this book once when i first saw the book , i wondered why we had to read this but now i feel as though i have missed out on a great work of literature
the year is 1943 war is raging across eastern europe and northern africa italy joins the battle , and so does japan peace seems improbable war is war , and its savage and horrific reality leaves tons of thousands of sodiers and civilians either dead or maimed for life
like many other readers and amazon reviewers , this book was assigned reading for me in high school i read it again recently when the kids got it and found it has not improved with age one wonders why generation after generation of teachers continues to tout this book as a classic when it 's really far from enjoyable
if this book was assigned to you as a high school student , you may have a tough time liking it your high school teacher either does n't like it but teaches it anyway , or else loves it so much that he she ca n't understand why you do n't
a separate peace is a tale of two friends at an elite prep school in new england during world war ii gene is an intelligent and studious boy with much ambition , while his friend phineas is more outgoing , athletic and charismatic gene feels jealous of finny which leads him to believe that finny does n't really like him and is just using him this insecure assertion leads to devastating results
having taught this book several times as an english teacher , i 've certainly had my exposure to it my view of the novel has certainly changed over time , as i 've come to regard the novel for all of its beauty i strike a single star from its score simply because i do n't believe the book has aged well it is not accessible and applicable to contemporary america like it was to the generation of adolescents who could still remember that there was such a thing as world war ii and that it was n't almost as long ago as noah 's flood to today 's teenagers , it comes across as cheesy this is truly a shame , suggesting we have reached a period in history in which the naivet of youth has been obliterated but then , that is what the novel is about , and perhaps it has grown even more meaningful today instead of reading this text as a commentary on individual maturation and the rites of passage associated with it , a separate peace must be viewed as a commentary on the development of modern america , a country that has grown much like gene , made mistakes like gene , and has come to realize a state of experience and worldliness that is a far cry from its origins
a separate peace has been read by many highschoolers , including myself over the years i have dread every book handed to me at school , they all just dragged on except for a separate peace , which has become my all time favorite school book the bond between two boys , named phineas and gene , at a boarding school in new hampshire during wwii captured me i ended up finishing it in four days \( which is fast for me \)
the brilliant author writer wordmaster pat conroy has always been my favorite all time author i love his style , his way with words , his storylines , dialogue , description , and masterful similes another conroy fan once e mailed me , asking if i knew anyone else who wrote as well as conroy well , i did a search and asked some of amazon 's top reviewers and they admitted they could n't find anyone comparable in style , etc
this was my first jodi picoult book and still my favorite i love her writing style the way she switches between characters keeps it interesting a real surprise ending , dont read the end and ruin it for yourself
what a very touching story that with stem cell research , could be true ! the author tells a gripping story through each characters' perspective this is a story that stays with you for a long , long time ! !
the emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable i found myself sobbing on more than one occasion terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment i identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared
a very interesting probe into a practice that is not too far from home any parent can identify with the pain of having a child with health problems , and the moral dilemna of having to choose one child over another is full of anguish well written and enjoyed by all i have shared this with
very well written , and presents ethical challenges of having one child to save another the emotional status of each family member in a family with a dying child is well represented these feelings and assigned roles took place in my own family so i can say with certainty the author hit the nail on the head in examining the individual impact
this was a fantastic book it really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness the story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister organ donor i really felt compelled to side with the well sister , but as a parent i could empathize with the parents as well this book will keep you up late until it 's finished a great read
makes you aware of some of the medical miracles happening in this country
very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor in the first story he explains his job as an elf at santaland and describes his daily life it is so funny , some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time
if you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you he may push it sometimes but is n't that what a good writer should do \? knowing he is half greek , so am i , i was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard unfortunately there was n't one santaland was my favorite
i generally like david sedaris in fact he 's one of my favorites but when his stories veer off into the death of children , almost gratuitously , i ca n't see the humor this is , please note , the first book of his that i have n't enjoyed but it 's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me
david sedaris was only famous for talking about christmas santaland diaries , heard on npr stations across the country , is what gave him his first fame this collection of stories came after his first book , barrel fever , and before the rest this is back when he was still writing short stories , which he is n't really known for anymore this book has a couple of short stories and , like the short stories in barrel fever , they 're not really accessible to a wider audience they 're dark baby murder dark definitely not something everyone can appreciate but pick it up , maybe you 'll like it if you 're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children 's holiday pageants bitterly , it 's worth a try
perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug , are n't i hilarious \? tone of this book note it is entirely possible that i am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book or even to identify the humor in the book
if you are looking for the literary equivalent of it 's a wonderful life this book is definitely not for you however , if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays , you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by david sedaris from jim timothy , the extortionist who preys upon a pentecostal church , to dinah , the christmas sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh even though you know clarence the angel would disapprove if you 've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats , curl up with this offering and you 'll find a kindred spirit in david sedaris
i was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if i was ok i was uncontrollably laughing even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure , it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds i was embarrassing myself again
david sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive all of his books make me laugh out loud embarrass myself in public places , when i bring his books along this one did not disappoint either funny holidays tales that make the season brighter , or even out of season give you a healthy hearty laugh
truly the author 's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas , parents , children , evangelical christians from kentucky , television , macy 's , the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war , and keeping up with the joneses
as i watched elie weisel on the oprah show i cried when ivbought his first book dawn i cried , and with every purchase i intend i will cry and say thank you god ! ! and mr weisel
1986 nobel prize peace winner elie wiesel is one of the great moral figures in the modern era his classic work 'night' perhaps more than any other work made horrifically clear the pain and suffering of the holocaust he has written over fifty works of literary and moral testimony , a number of which are not simply classics of literature but which changed the course of history one of those was his 'jews of silence' on the fate of russian jewry
sue grafton has created the best female detective bar none ! kinsey 's cases are realistic , and she is so real that you find yourself looking for her on the street there is no higher praise for an author
in this tale , our friend kinsey , is out to find who started a fire in the wood warren warehouse but somewhere in the investigating kinsey finds herself weaved into this horrible mess with her life and career on the line here kinsey stretches to desperate measures to not only find out who started the fire but also who committed murder its a rollercoaster ride till the end , but hop on , cause like i said e is for excellent and exciting
evidence is the key word in e is for evidence , from evidence planted to implement another , to lost evidence , etc grafton likes e words because there are lots of them in here to accompany evidence we have ex lovers , evasions , enemies , exoneration and endings
`e' is for evidence is the fifth in a series of sue grafton 's mystery novels about the loner ex cop private detective kinsey millhone in this episode , kinsey is framed for insurance fraud along with her high school friend 's brother , lance wood as she tries to clear her name , she gets caught up in the wood family politics and we get to see a softer side of kinsey than she would probably care to show grafton does a thorough job of developing her characters along with providing enough detail to allow the reader to feel as though he or she is actually in santa teresa , california the twists and turns that this story takes will keep you guessing until the end
usually people do n't complain about receiving money from an anonymous source , but investigator kinsey millhone knows that she needs to report the 5000 which has mysteriously appeared in her bank account no one seems to know where the money has come from and soon it is all part of a problem that involves kinsey as a suspect in an insurance fraud case as she delves into the investigation , she uncovers a prominent family 's secrets and continues to get into trouble herself as usual , kinsey 's investigation causes physical danger to her , until she hunts down the perpetrator this is another good read from sue grafton
this book is timeless in its content and most espescially in regard to dr yunus winning the nobel peace prize this year \( 2006 \) and grameen 's announcement of their open source software mifos initiative anyone who wants to truly understand how micro lending can be a powerful tool to battle poverty must read this book
this books makes you appreciate all of the advantages that one is afforded by simply being born into an advanced economy yunus does an great job of explaining his rational for how he developed his bank and what has made it successful he truly does deserve his nobel prize as i am sure his banking model will have an ever widening affect on the lives of millions for generations to come
i found banker to the poor to be an excellent , enjoyable read that provided me invaluable insights into poverty in third world countries , and educated me about effective market driven ways to allieviate poverty , empower the poor and transform poor women from victims to successful entrepreneurs well worth anyone 's time to read the author 's award of the nobel peace prize seems very deserving
yunus tells a great story about his bank and its battle against poverty outstanding business model for someone interested in micro lending
this was an absolutely amazing book it has given me renewed hope that poverty can be eliminated from this earth and will redirect my contribution dollars i am heartened by what one man could accomplish through his own initiatives a must read for all economists and humanitarians
in the 1970s professor mohammed yunus had a great idea on how to help the poor of bangladesh and he made it work he invented micro credit , or lending very small amounts to the poorest of the poor , without asking for collateral this , rather than simple handouts , would help the poor become self reliant enough so that they could lift themselves out of poverty he concentrated on women he relied on peer support to motivate repayment of the loans by making loans to one member of a group of women who would have access to credit only if the entire group had a good credit record \( when a group started , they were assumed to have good credit \) professor yunus 's organization , the grameen bank , is a cooperative owned mostly by its members and boasts a repayment rate over 98
founded in bangladesh by muhammad yunus in 1976 , the grameen bank is one of the most successful attempts ever to employ capitalist principles to achieve social goals by approaching poverty from a different tact , grameen seeks to reconcile the inequalities inherent in capitalism by mobilizing the informal sector of society the self employed poor by addressing the root cause of poverty \( i e lack of access to capital \) yunus has succeeded where many others have failed often , well intentioned governments fail to solve the issue of poverty because of misguided development policies and bloated bureaucracies similarly , many international financial institutions , such as the world bank , have failed because their heavy handed top down approach excludes those most in need of aid yunus writes , i have always believed that the elimination of poverty from the world is a matter of will \( 248 \) grameen succeeds where others fail because they appeal to the most downtrodden , the poorest of the poor the bottom 50 of those already below the poverty line
reader ,
this book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than i am but while i was reading , i kept asking myself , when 's he going to get to the point \? the first part of the book is all about why it 's good to be rich something i thought was unnecessary the bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle class and poor finally , in the last part of the book , he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy this was the only part of the book i was interested in to me , it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30 page book on investing and so kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with fluff however , even his advice is considered questionable by many experts i would say that the main idea i got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd i just wish i had n't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise
i think this is the best of the series it is real easy to read which i like because you can finish it fast it has some great lessons and makes some wonderful points about investing for future retirement anyone can learn something from this that they can put to good use
i do n't think you should read this book hoping to find how to retire young and retire rich as most people would think of the book does n't tell you that what the book does , is help you change your mind , the only thing i think that will really help you change your financial reality i do n't get tired of reading kiyosaki the more you read , the more you understand
this has to be my least favorite of my kiyosaki collection i will sum it up for you think and know the power of leverage , passive income is taxed at a lower rate than earned income , and you gotta buy assets ! there , you can continue shopping
retire young retire rich is split up into four sections the fourth section is simply and closing speaking to those who may need help keeping the wind in their sails after aquireing the knowledge to fuel their finacial journey the first three sections are the real meat and potatoes of the book they not only include a collection of all of the advice , tactics , and tricks kiyosaki 's rich dad taught him over the years , but it also contains kioysaki 's testimonials trajedy and triumph
numerous reviewers of this book are disappointed that kiyosaki does not present a detailed how to become wealthy
words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed i feel about buying this book
i read the first paragraph of this book in the bookstore and i knew i had to buy it it hits you right off the bat and does n't let up until the end i love all the contradictions this book has in store everything in this book is so far fetched but so funny go out and buy it its a must read for anyone who wants a good laugh
this is undoubtedly the strangest book i 've read in a long time
i love strangers with candy so when i saw that this book was written by the same people i just had to buy it i first got it for my best friend and he thought it was crazy but goo , so i gave it a try great book , crazy , but halarious if you like the show then this book has the same comedy style so give it a try
if you enjoy the cobert report with steven cobert , formerly of the daily show , you will surely enjoy his reading of this wigged out novel i love his malaprops , nonsequitors , puns , and insane logic jokes come in threes the set up , the set up , and the twisted jab to the funny bone perhaps , the people who do n't like this book need to have it read to them like a bedtime story then they would hear \( out loud \) the marvelously witty word play they could listen and hear the word paintings and crazy voices of the wigfield sheriffs and mayors and strippers there are at least three of each for reasons made clear in the book so , buy the cd version and play it while you drive \( try not to run off the road laughing \) and then when you read the book you wo n't have to move your lips to hear it as for me , i'm going to buy the book to see the funny photographs pure genius marketing strategy if you ask me if you ca n't read silently and understand the humor you have to buy the cd version , and then after you 've listened to the cd you have to buy the book version to see if the wigfield populace can possibly look as stupid as they sound
i guess i'm in the minority of talent family strangers with candy fans who loved this book it was so over the top and ridiculous , but that 's what makes it great like another reviewer said , the pictures alone make it worth the price of admission i checked this one out of the library , but would n't mind owning it , to go back and re read my favorite passages and crack up over the insane pictures
this would have been a good skit , or maybe a short story , but not an entire novel the book is tired like the town wigfield
sharp , quick whit if you like edgy comedy you will love this ! for all the bad reviews , it must have just been over their heads
i love david sedaris i like strangers with candy but this is the worst book i 've ever read all of the characters are exactly the same , and the entire book is a repetition of one joke save yourself valuable time and money and stay far , far away from wigfield
funny people have it bad when they 're actually making you laugh they 're fine when they 're failing to make you laugh they come off as desperate , flailing nerds i was a huge fan of stranger with candy whose writing was incisive and brutally funny less so with the book of liz , and even less so with this book sedaris , colbert dinello are funny people but this is an embarassment it 's abundantly clear now that they require a format \( ripe for a send up \) to shine was there a 2nd draft or was this a cash in for their agents \? every joke in this nervous to please dud is a throwaway a tiresome type of joke starts on page 1 by page 2 you 've detected the formula and by page 3 it 's just grating the plot is the flimsiest possible structure three smart asses can bounce bad puns jokes off of it quickly collapses i could not complete it but i suspect the book ends up being lightweight crap when you commit to nothing but your own funniness you never get around to questions of merit this is a desperately nerdy book , just as the posed funny pictures suggest \( i 've never seen less funny pictures \) who was the intended audience for this \? the dumbest person i know has a more sophisticated funny bone than this
really , i hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review , but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves you 'd think it 'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot you 'd think that , but you 'd be wrong instead you 'd be left saying , jon stewart , my man , you liked this \? seriously \? are you high \? no , wait do n't answer that , it 's all becoming abundantly clear to me now
i am reading the book right now and am enjoying all the little tid bits of information the book is easy to navigate through with it being set around days of the year though , it is easy to forget that the author is talking about a specific day being opening day for a movie , someone 's birthday , etc
this book is so much fun i love having something small to read daily some of the trivia is even new to me ! ! a great addition to any disney collectors library

i 've read only a few of hillerman 's previous leaphorn chee novels i 've enjoyed what i 've rtead , though they are an acquired taste , and i do n't indulge in them very often i tend to enjoy the earlier , more active years of joe leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi retired unofficial advisor to jim chee' phase
i had been a bit disappointed by the last couple of tony hillerman 's books this one was much more like the 'old' hillerman i am enchanted by how hillerman moves jim chee and joe leaphorn along the road of life , gives interesting insight into navajo and hopi culture , and still presents good solid mysteries hillerman is an outstanding writer with a relaxed and easy style like all of the earlier chee leaphorn novels this one leaves you a bit breathless and with a smile on your face really good stuff
i read this and could n't put it down i have a friend who reads him regularly so i thought i 'd give his book a chance
but the bones of the man attaced to a case of diamonds are the girl 's best friend , and she 's trying to find them to prove the bones match her dna this mystery features a scramble along the grand canyon to find the missing bones , deposited as a result of a legendary 1956 airplane crash an unscrupulous lawyer also wants the bones , to prevent the lady from making her claim to the billion dollar inheritance navaho and hopi policemen from hillerman 's many books get involved in the hunt too
after reading so many positive reviews , i decided to try skeleton man as my first hillerman novel unfortunately , i'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it
skeleton man is another masterpiece for tony hellerman only problem is he does n't write them fast enough
tony hillerman never disappoints me ! another in a long line of attention grabbing stories
the newest leaphorn chee sequel does not disappoint the reader the supporting characters were all present and the native \( spiritual \) customs were explained in their usual forthright manner if you are a follower of the leaphorn chee mystery series this book is a must read and if you are new to this series it wo n't matter because hillerman does enough character backgrounding to bring you up to date
skeleton man is another success for tony hillerman the usual well planned mystery to solve , and more about three of my favorite characters , joe , jim , and bernie who appreciate the desert so much

the decline of the west is the magnum opus of oswald spengler \( 1880 1936 \) , a german historian and philosopher in it , spengler rejects the idea that the future of the west \( or indeed of any culture \) is an open ended advance from the primitive past to an ever more glorious and expansive future instead , cultures \( including the west \) experience an almost organic history of spring , summer , autumn and winter
this postmodern chronicle of the western world by early 20th century german historian and philosopher , oswald spengler , offers a lot for today 's reader despite its flaws it 's an incredibly rich and complex analysis , attacking the causal factors of the development of western culture on many fronts simultaneously historically , scientifically , artistically , architecturally , ecclesiastically , and so much more this book is capable of describing many different aspects of western culture to many different readers , depending on who they happen to be and what their interest in western history is i will only mention three aspects of spengler 's work in my review , since these aspects are what grabbed my attention , bearing in mind that the book contains much more than what i touch on here
a poory written , racially charged work by a bitter , probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a key to historical development in addition to the cycle of history thesis , he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle , spengler points to a nation 's will and race as the key to a kultur 's success
quite simply the most important book of the twentieth century for several reasons
the theory of spengler is as follows historical comparison of cultural formation , of governments , of civilizations , of art , architecture and music , of mathematics , science , philosophy , revolutions and control , of formations , destructions and deteriorations of societies and cultures are thus interpreted to have a similarity with biological structure just as a sentient being is born , forms , grows , molds , progresses , digresses , deteriorates , ages , decays and dies , so it is with cultures and civilizations in this case , a culture in its childlike creative ability solidifies into non creative matter , stagnant , authoritarian and brittle and then dies
this is the last book in the dark elf trilogy that tells the tale of how drizzt fares in the surface world i think its a great follow up to exile , and really puts into perspective the challenges a dark elf faces in the eyes of surface dwellers that do not want to accept him once again , salvatore creates memorable characters that heavily influence drizzt 's life he learns and gains much wisdom in this book and i think its a necessary bridge to icewind dale
the 2nd best book in my opinion of the trilogy puts drizzt finding his home in the surface world what makes this book so great is the fact he knows nothing about the surface and its surroundings , seeing him as he develops and learns the processes of weather conditions or how he learns to build a fire to survive those harsh conditions is intriguing in this book he befriends a old and blind ranger called mooshie , and he teaches him a little bit of everything , including the human tongue , how to follow the ways of the goddess meliki and alot of other philosophy stuff to soothe his burden
this has got to be one of my all time favorite books if you 're a big fantasy buff , and have read any other works of r a salvatore , this is a must read a lot of people really enjoyed the character drizzt from the icewind dale trilogies , and this three part epic compiles everything that ever happened to him before you first met him in the earlier book the characters beside drizzt are amazing and dynamic , bringing their own unique touch to the story this book is suitable for anyone over the age of ten , yet is n't a kid 's novel the world salvatore creates in the dark elf trilogies is fantastic , and quite immense also ranging from the delving caverns of the underdark to the over world , the setting plays a major role in the story , just like in other fantasy books , except more so in this one this book is loaded with detail , and the plot will be sure to keep the reader wondering what 's going to happen next some parts may seem a bit predictable , but they are n't as important as the major events overall , this has got to be one of the best fantasy books i have ever read , and i personally enjoy it more than the lord of the rings and other epics i definitely recommend to anyone interested in the fantasy genre to read this book , otherwise you 'll be missing out on a great opportunity
god , this book was awful ! not just the story , it was the construction that turned me off the storyline is weak and the writing immature characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier there is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events i can go on but i guess i need to be more concrete
i had never heard of r a salvatore before i picked up homeland , instantly within a few pages of reading i was hooked on what was the best trilogy of books i have read since the lord fo the rings , in my own opinion he managed to captivate my mind by exploring a world of complete darkness , but with such intricate detail i sometimes forgot that i had been reading for a few hours its a great story about finding your own path in life no matter who stands in your way a story about love , even if its completely useless where you come from drizzt do'urden is character that will forever live within , and prove what a true author can do
sojourn is the conclusion of the dark elf trilogy which began with homeland , continued in exile and ends here if you 've not read the first two books then i suggest you do so now because the third book is a direct continuation of the other books and you 'll be missing out quite a lot by starting here
the book was on good condition and quickly delivere
i'm the director of a christian environmental website , and i 've read dozens of christian books on ecology and the environment this is one of my all time favorites i love this book ! it may very well be the best book on the biblical basis for environmental stewardship ! buy it for yourself , or buy it as a textbook for environmental study outstanding ! what makes it particularly unique and special is that it is written by 4 biologists ! my only complaint is that there is little or no mention of the great christian conservationist , john paul ii it 's still very much worth a read
the boston based author , dennis lehane , wrote a great detective story with a social background so great , it is almost more important than the plot mystic river differs from lehane 's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer
what 's wrong with all you amamzon reviewers \?
three childhood friends from a boston working class neighborhood , who lost their innocence through a tragic shared occurrence , are forced together again as adults when one of their daughters is murdered each is wrapped tightly into the investigation , but each must also unwrap themselves in order come to terms with this latest tragedy and its conclusion
this is a brilliant novel that i ca n't recommend highly enough
it 's a crime novel it 's human drama it 's gritty eloquent and literary there are few other writers to whom to compare lehane he has a style all his own and a beautiful way of weaving old fashioned crime fiction into a tapestry of moral drama and psychological examination
wow ! an intense read at time the subject matter can be difficult to handle , but the story is amazing the movie does not do the novel justice
when i bought the book i did not know that they already made a movie out of it but i learned about it later on so i was really excited when i started to read it also because other comments were really good
this book is very touching you get caught up with daves character this book pulls you in and keeps you on the edge waiting and wondering what would happen next it takes a turning point when one of the friends gets kidnapped by two man claiming to be officers during that time they fall apart at lease one of them does they lose there friendship after the incident and become friends again but not to the same strenght they did before until another problem occurs then all of them come back into contact with each other again it makes you think how far does friendship go \? alot of people that had friends when they where younger dont anymore so i ask my self a question how strong is a friendship after a traggic situation this book tells more info then the movie did and i like that i feel bad for one of the friends cause after all that happened to him he was different
i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we 're supposed to believe that the haunted , passive , timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school \? the book had a great premise and good beginning , but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character
dennis lehane 's mystic river is a suspenseful , mind teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more one of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child , but manages to escape four days later twenty five years after that , the friends have grown apart , and one of the men 's daughters has been mysteriously murdered this tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten i would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery
i accidentally bumped into this book when i was in my 20s had no idea where it would lead me read it practically in one sitting i was amazed that i understood what cabell was driving at even tho i could not have explained it coherently to anyone
i have finished jurgen a great and beautiful book , and the saddest book i ever read i do n't know why , exactly the book hurts me tears me to small pieces but somehow it sets me free it says the word that i 've been trying to pronounce for so long it tells me everything i am , and have been , and may be , unsparingly i do n't know why i cry over it so much it 's too something or other to stand i 've been sitting here tonight , reading it aloud , with the tears streaming down my face deems taylor , in a letter dated december 12 , 1920
i read this 1921 book because h l mencken , my guide when it comes to literature , thought so highly of it it is perhaps most difficult to read because it is a fable and fables of course , do not consist of characters and actions which are based in reality the book is a little hard to follow at the beginning it is rather hard to explain what the story is about
than the memory of some temptation we resisted
other reviews have given the outline of the narrative , but a good way to convey the strength and variety of the writing not always cynical , as some suggest is to follow the example of the reviewer who quoted the first line as a touchstone \( sell the apples by offering a free bite \) in that respect , here are a few more snippets
james branch cabell was once the most celebrated figure of american literature he was the favourite author of mark twain , and was also praised by other renowned writers , including sinclair lewis this book , jurgen , is among cabell 's very finest \( all his work is fine \) , a book that was long closest to cabell 's heart , and the one that has the centre of his philosophy , the eternal search for beauty , his one ideal , as the main subject matter
any guy , especially one over forty , who does n't adore this book , and does n't have at least a dozen cabell books on his shelf , including at least one signed first edition , is a savage if you do n't understand the heart rending chapter , dorothy who did not understand , you have n't lived
perhaps the finest fantasy ever written by an american writer it will change your life every time you read it cabell was brilliant and heinlein copied him more than once \( compare job a comedy of justice \) cabell was sexy , ironic , consistant even asimov , in his final works attempted to equal the history of dom manuel by combining the robots and foundation into a single cosmology
magically recovering his youth , jurgen , a poet cum pawn broker of medaeval france , begins an erotic odyssey , in which he beds king arthur 's bride to be , a love goddess in her realm of pleasure , a tree nymph , the queen of philistines , a vampire in hell he also gets to talk to god , satan and the mysterious katschei , creator of all things as they are full of puns , word play , references to obscure myths and legends of various cultures , and americanizing the tradition of the picaresque epic , jurgen is a delight for the mensa set and ordinary readers alike this edition reproduces the delightful illustrations cut for the first british publication of the work
this work is more of a 'textbook' than a simple 'cookbook ' it should be approached methodically , and with a goal of mastering the details of processes , rather than just creating something tasty for dinner while that is still certainly the outcome it is a masterpiece as a culinary educational tool
i ordered this classic book for my step sister for her birthday she is a gourmet cook and had always wanted this book by ms child it was on her wish list created at amazon com she was elated to receive this volume one and so my review is based on her exhuberant response
i got this book recently and i am super pleased with it the writing is very enjoyable and the directions on the recipes and added cultural information are superb this classic belongs in every kitchen , so do n't hesitate to purchase it if your still not convinced here 's some good reasons for you to get it
full of information , and still relevant for todays cooks , these books should never be out of print
i have always enjoyed cooking , but had never read this book i thought that traditional french cooking would be difficult to master , high in fat and unnecessarily time consuming also i'm an italian american i thought that hazan was the last word in cooking boy , was i wrong
this is the cookbook that formed the foundation for julia child 's famous series the french chef some parts of this edition recognize the new appliances available since the book was published 25 years before , like the food processor the recipes , however , are still classics although julia apologizes in the foreword for being neither french nor a trained chef , it is this well written , comprehensive cookbook that helped to change the way americans eat although some of the recipes are a bit intimidating like entirely boning a chicken or duck , most are attainable for the best quiche you 've ever made buy the crust if you ca n't bake make julia 's recipe for this lorraine classic
this is one of two books to get , to kick you from
twenty five years ago i developed a taste for cooking just out of the marines , i picked up the julia child set after seeing and enjoying her show on pbs this set is a personal treasure and one that got me started on my collection of more than 100 cookbooks today
first , i cannot cook other then basic heat and serve
yes it is true , if you can read you can cook french julia and frendshave made it most easy to cook the french way and enjoy it
i wanted a book that would cover a wide array of reviews and struck gold with this one though now that i think of it , maybe i should have held out for one that included non american writers in it i'm such a dunce , i did n't see until too late that , on the title page , clearly marked , it reads , a special publication of the library of america no wonder it 's so america centric , but i picked up the book and opened it by happenstance to penelope gilliatt 's scintillating review of fassbinder 's petra von kant , and naturally i took the book to be more international in scope than it actually is in what universe do people think of gilliatt as a us writer \? it does n't really matter because what remains deserves four stars
i was surprised , first of all , that the book was available it had been published the day before i was also surprised at how fast it came only about 3 days and , of course , the price was terrific
a popular entertainment that sometimes aspires to and occasionally achieves the status of art criticism has always been a stressed and intricate exercise , something that few reviewers manage to excel at and those who do may come to regret it \( just ask a few of ammie 's top reviewers \)
any collection strong in entertainment and movie history , especially college level holdings , will want to have american movie critics an anthology from the silents until now in their collection it 's the first anthology to categorize , define and explore movie reviewing as a discipline of its own chapters blend a history of the rose of movies with a concurrent survey of the rise of movie critics and reviewing methods , tracking changes in methods , contributions of notable critics over the decades , and including quotes and samples from some of today 's best over a hundred fifty pieces by nearly eighty contributors span nearly a hundred years

james rollins has followed up map of bones with another thought provoking action novel the nazi obsession with the occult and their research into quantum technology proves a very interesting centerpiece for this book also , rollins has also taken further steps to develop the characters that make up the sigma force hopefully he will continue the sigma force series for years to come
it was good read , indeed very good , but the writer needs to know that fiona is not a pakistani name , and pakistanis are light brown colored but not dark brown or balck and no pakistani can be mistaken for an african like he described in fiona 's disguise another thing that i felt was that except for monk 's bald head and prosthetic hand , all 3 sigma operatives including gray , crowe and monk felt like the same person in terms of character building
gripping from the first pages do n't start this until you have a pretty good chunk of time available you wo n't want to need to put the book down elaine garret
i did n't bargain on getting a complete understanding of quantum physics from a great work of fiction , but that is what i got you can be in two places at once this work of art is the most enjoyable book i have read in years rollins is to be commended for outstanding writing , research , plot development and overall hyper speed fun
very interesting topic and fun to read i could n't wait to crawl into bed every night and find out what was going to happen next
the one caveat about reading a james rollins book is that it takes patience to get through it the storyline is usually a multi threaded complexity that sweeps you from one country , in one chapter , to the other side of the world , in the next chapter and pulls you into a fascinating plot that blends historical fact with science fiction
an exciting , fun book it keeps your interest with a fast pace and riveting adventure
rollins' book is an unfortunate combination of the generic and the pretentious there 's nothing wrong with a generic thriller , as other reviews have pointed out but if the author wishes to float a seemingly serious argument about evolution v intelligent design , it would behoove him to provide a moderately sturdy frame the material from quantum physics does hark back to jurassic park , while the nazi involvement moves us into the neighborhood of the boys from brazil or the assassini even the surprise ending evident from about 200 pages away is lifted straight from the genesis code by john case but those conspiracy theory classics \( well , case 's is n't a classic , but it 's a good read \) are anchored by well developed characters and minimal dependency on the crutch of coincidence
james rollins is quickly becoming one of the best thrill writers in america black order is an exciting story dealing with nazis and quantum evolution in an action packed trip reaching to the far corners of the world
i got black order without knowing the author or hearing anything about the book i have to give props to a book that makes me seek out more by that author , which is exactly what happened after reading this one since then , i 've only read an earlier rollins book \( amazonia \) but i can already see that in later books , he 's willing to inject a little more humor black order 's fiona is one of my favorite characters i 've encountered in a long time she 's fiesty , hilarious and so cool the writing is more colorful , the way he frames the stories is more skillful in this book than amazonia and it 's got enough meat for the smart set lots of history , travel , nature , philosophy i heard the audiobook version and it did drag a little when the science got too heavy but there was enough fast paced action to balance it all rollins has to be a fan of the james bond and indiana jones b c you definitely see elements of those in his work that 's all fine with me because i say bring on more sigma force !
this book is more a bon bon than anything substantial but if you like dogs , you 'll find this book a hoot the premise is simple dogs have had an impact on history
this is an excellent and well researched book describing how humans and dogs have interacted through history it includes a wealth of interesting information about both individual and societal attitudes towards dogs and how those attitudes impacted events although the book is about the role of dogs in history , the stories humanize historical events by showing how compassion towards or fear of dogs affected individual people and societies great book
dogs are my passion , in this wonderfully written book i 've found that i am in great company it was well written , some of the stories could have been shorter but it made me laugh and cry , and after almost every chapter i was amazed at what i did n't know about the people in the chapter the research was extensive for this book so if you love dogs and you love history you will really love this book
this interesting book discusses the relationships between several noteable people and their dogs at least one cynical washington d c politician said that if you want someone to love you in this town , buy a dog , and you will find he was not the first one to conjure up that thought the author shows how people such as florence nightingale , frederick the great , robert burns , and sigmund freud were all warmly touched by the positive side of their dogs these people , who somehow seemed so intensely boring in history class , never seemed so human as when interacting with their dogs dogs have served as companions for many others who needed a consistent friend , and they often served as inspirations for those who enriched our artistic and aesthetic lives \( perhaps because they were so cheerful and so honest \) oh , by the way , the author gives us some pretty interesting lessons in history and the arts , too , so this story is not just about the canids if you are looking for a good book to curl up with , and read to , your animal companions , give this one a try
this is a wonderful book it is fun to read about mary manheim 's childhood and her career and the cases she has worked on the short chapters focus on particular cases she has helped solve it is sprinkled through out with stories of life in louisiana
do n't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there this book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases i guess it lives up to its subtitle of life as a forensic anthropologist in that she usually presents only her part in each case with little presentation of the entire case the forensic cases are not really the star of this book , the author is i was frustrated with the lack of depth instead , read the body farm by bill bass excellent storytelling there ! he gives you personal stories , but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated
i found this book quite tedious , since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work there is almost no information on forensic anthropology her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them , rather than what the actual details were from the cover and the blurbs i expected actual case histories the book does n't deliver the book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally
i read this book with my bookclub it sounded witty and fun it was not it was very boring and a big let down most of the stories went like this we found a dead body , this is what we did , then we went home
i found this book to be very interesting and an enjoyable , light read as a real life csi with an interest in skeletal remains , i am very much interested in forensic related books , both fiction and non fiction i had skipped the first chapter , which is an autobiography , wanting to get to the meat of the anthopology cases , but found myself developing an interest in the modest , likeable author halfway through the book , i went back and read the first chapter
several years ago , i had the great opportunity to have mary manhein as a teacher in a beginning anthropology class at louisiana state university i have a great time and she had a great impact on me i did make the mistake at the time of not going into anthropology at the time but right now i am trying to rectify that boo boo this is a great book and i highly recommend it
in this thorough grand history of africa since independence every story is told , every nation explained and everything from economics to politics fully laid out in a region by region view all the great and tragic stories of africa since 1950 are told , from idi amin ot hastings banda to aparthied to the war in angola and the death of lumumba no stone is left unturned from nasser to de klerk to the biafran war , to rwanda and sudan this is an eminently fair account , unbiased and accurate , a giant tour of the continent of despair and hope although a massive read the author writes with skill and interest , thoroughly researched with obscure primary sources and based on new material available from archives this book is a wonderful account of modern africa
like steven gilbar 's the book book \( see my review \) , this is a great item to just pick up and open you 're sure to find something interesting in it no matter what page you choose though not marketed as such , it will prove most interesting to parents of children from grade school through high school age , and may indeed be used as a compendium of reading lists by homeschoolers besides allusions , quotations , and definitions , the bulk of the book , as with gilbar , is given over to lists of books everything from best selling books to 1990s literature from around the world there 's no reason an intelligent teen ca n't take a taste of everything strouf lists serious minded ones may also want to check out list 9 \( influential writers from around the world \) , 14 \( literary criticism \) , and 16 \( u s british irish critics \) for ideas on where to go next but above all , buy it for sections 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 \( books for all ages , genres for every taste , drama , themes , and literary periods \) and the titles and authors in section 4 \( poetry \) it 's true that there are a few rather glaring typos that would have been caught by an editor who knew his books , but by searching under both author and title you should still be able to find all the items listed then get yourself a used copy of gilbar \( get his great books too \) and the prentice hall good reading guide , and you 'll have a treasure trove worthy of the fabled indies to search and sample
this book would 've been a find if i were in my early teens , but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile , this book is just too lightweight yes , it is about books and literature , but the coverage is extremely shallow i would consider this to be something like the reader 's digest condensed books form of benet 's reader 's encyclopedia buy that work instead of you 're looking for a good reference work on literature

here goes my laymen 's attempt at paraphrasing matthew 22 vs 34 thru 3 love god with all that you have in you , is the most important commandment says jesus , yet right along side \( as on the other side of the same coin , or as two wings on a plane \) is love your neighbor as much as you love yourself and all of what the prophets say and all of the other commandments are built upon these 2 things that jesus said labeled the greatest commandment that indicates the importance of it
i purchased this for my grandson' birthday and read it before i gave it to him i am not very sports minded but it was a well written biography of a spectacular human being who is doing a good job of showing young men what makes a great man in god 's eyes
a must read for all public and private school athletic coaches this excellent book epitomizes the characteristics deemed necessary to assist and mold america 's young people
i played college football and pro baseball i have very vivid memories of my coaches since childhood i had a coach in high school , larry book , who made a big impression on me he was great and i remember him fondly , though i liked him more after i left than i did when i played for him as good as he was , we never talked about life things , real important things joe ehrman 's coaching style i 've never really heard of or come across he explains what it means to be a man , to love , to give , in words that i never really heard before , certainly not from a football coach even if you 've never played football , this true story is one you 'll want to read and share with others i have multiple copies
this was a great book and very easy to read i liked it so much i sent a copy to about ten friends and family members jeffrey marx learns what is important in life , something we all have to decide at some point or another
i'm fortunate enough to live in the baltimore area and have heard joe ehrmann speak and preach knowing he is a thoroughly captivating speaker , i was eager to see if the book would stand up on its own it more than does jeffrey marx is an extremely talented and gifted author and captures not only the detail of the story , but also puts into words the emotions of his own journey the book takes you on a season long journey with a high school football team and how they are taught to love one another , first and foremost i was extremely curious how this would be taught within the physicality of football this is a must read for all coaches , regardless of sport i have been able to discuss some of the principles in the book with my 8 year old son and 7 year old daughter and i can already see the change in their thinking and behaviors
this is an excellent book filled with many messages on what it means to be a man many of my friends and i are so inspired by this book that we have invited the author to our community to speak with our school administrators , teachers , coaches , and teenage boys buy it for every father coach you know you wo n't regret it
i grew up idolizing sports heros stumbling on to a job as ball boy for the colts like marx did would have been my wildest dream come true that put me in his shoes right away what really gripped me though is having an 11 year old son to teach about becoming a good man
first , full disclosure , i am a gilman alumnus from the 80 's there is no question that gilman is an elite school built by and for the wealthy of baltimore however , thanks in large part to a previous headmaster , the school began integrating early in the 60 's and strove to have a diverse student body i will guarantee right now that the school is far more diverse , in every sense than 99 of schools out there the few examples given of underprivileged kids going to gilman only scratch the surface , and do n't include those who were not recruited for athletics , but rather academics some as young as 5 years old , long before any athletic talent becomes apparent charleyhart 's comments are only partially founded in the reality of the school indeed , long before joe ehrman , the majority of gilman men believed that in an ideal world places like gilman would be available to all children many of us , a higher proportion , than the general public , have gone into service , whether as teachers in the poorest of neighborhoods , or as health professionals , advocates etc i agree that gilman students by and large are extremely privileged , simply by attending the school however , for those that are from wealthy families , the lessons that they learn at gilman aid them in aiding society through politics , philanthropy , and service i will always be proud stand shoulder to shoulder with my brethren and anyone else who believes that all children deserve the gilman experience i understand that in order to make this a reality , those with power must be taught to understand the realities of the world gilman does that , and has always emphasized this charleyhart 's review does not reflect this reality i'm sure that he and i agree that all children should have this experience and like all gilman men , will strive in whatever ways we can to make it so
aldon morris writes the history of the civil rights movement as the gradual organization of black communities in the south in response to jim crow morris' account begins with early protests in north carolina , tennessee and other peripheral states that multiplied and culminated in the more well known actions in alabama and georiga throughout the account , morris emphasizes the indigenous nature of the movement black communities organizing around black institutions \( the black church \) with their own financial and infrastructural resources
articulate and provocative , aldon morris' study of the american civil rights movement is a comprehensive and comprehensible analysis of a strategic struggle for human survival and essential dignity emphasizing that african americans have rarely accepted the subordinate position forced upon them , that the civil rights movement was carefully orchestrated rather than a series of random events , and that women played a critical role in the organization and implementation of the movement , morris incisively resurrects and dismantles official discourses in the tradition of john hope franklin 's from slavery to freedom , lerone bennett 's forced into glory , and ivan van sertima 's they came before columbus , morris reconstructs history with a fresh perspective morris' extensive use of the interview technique enables the reader to probe the minds of the makers and shakers of the movement , as we hear them speak in their own words somewhat academic in its approach , yet eminently readable , origins of the civil rights movement can be understood and appreciated by middle school students , academicians , and history buffs alike it is a must read for those interested in a complete understanding of american history in general and of african american history in particular
mcdonald 's is one of the great symbols of america , and most countries around the world absolutely love mcdonald 's if you want to know the history of the mega giant corporation , this is a good starting place we are capitalists in america we love making money , and that can only be considered a good thing mcdonald 's embodies much of the american spirit and american dream sure , the food is n't healthy as if that 's a newflash for anyone these days but eating it in moderation is not harmful in any way oh , and westcoaster \( below \) did n't actually read this book prior to reviewing it that person just has a problem with successful business people earning money if you do n't have that problem , read the book and marvel at the entrepreneurial spirit and to hades with the naysayers come to think of it , i'm outta here gotta grab a quarter pounder with cheese , baby
funny how people always vote a review to be not helpful when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter does n't like
this is a great bio of a great company though it is somewhat dated , this book will set the standard for every deep inquiry into how mcdonald 's operates it is simply a remarkable story
you know how there have been some searing indictments of mcdonald 's in the last few years , ranging from fast food nation to that movie supersize me \?
the book is fantasticly well researched and shares with you the full story of how ray kroc built the restaurant chain i must say that especially now during the times of obecedy and the atkins diet i got to respect the hamburger guys \( again \) the concept and strategy of mcdonalds and the execution of the strategy is an amazing study on how to run a business
this is an incredible history and in depth anaylsis of mcdonalds well written , easy to read and extremely well researched i 've re read it at least 20 times and purchased several copies for friends
i have read this book two times , once as a teenager and now 40 years later it is a great book and easy to read i was amazed as a teen ager , and now , how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around america in a camper and write about it he can do more than write well about things , he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him
i was n't too into this one i'm a big fan of steinbeck 's fiction , but this memoir is rather dull i was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of america at the time he wrote it but as an older man \( as he even admits \) he is n't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths the ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he does n't have too much to say
favorite memories of this book come from years ago when i could not put the book down as i read of steinbecks travels with his poodle for those whose minds wander and wonder about the roads , towns and people of the u s , i highly recommend this book i am purchasing it to read again
this book is vital and interesting , even across the gulf of the 40 odd years since it was written steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60 's generation gap and even the far side of post world war ii industrialization and urbanization
first i must admit to a certain bias here i travel a lot , i travel with a dog as a companion and i enjoy reading this particular author i was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date i can relate to this work ! that being said , this is one of those books that i have reread several times over the years , and year after year , i find that steinbeck 's observations contunue to be relevant this is a very easy reading book i do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though , that this is not a novel \( despite what his son said \) ! it is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author 's eyes it is interpreted through the author 's past expierences and how he preceives the world i am sure that any ten \( or one hundred \) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten \( or one hundred \) different stories and interpretations of those stories i shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations others i did not that is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read , or better yet , talk to others , and agree or disagree , enjoy their views i certainly cannot fault the author 's usage of language , syntax and organization it is all good solid steinbeck this is one of those books that can be read on several levels you can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in america , or , as i do , you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author as a side note i do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring i can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies , t v etc of this day and age i might suggest though , that you give it another read in a few years perhaps you will look at it differently i know i have expierence that with other works by different authors all in all , recommend this one highly
i first read this book at about age 12 that period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man 's best friend , so i was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup , took his dog , and drove around the united states it did n't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an old guy he shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill you want to grab a sleeping bag , some grub , and hit the road at that time , i was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in steinbeck 's camper it would be a few years before i saw the movies of mice and men and the grapes of wrath , which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who john steinbeck was and what he was about in travels with charley the reader does n't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of steinbeck 's fiction in this book steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man , like andy rooney now that i'm getting kind of old myself , i find myself experiencing the changes in the world steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book when he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer , you get the willies along with steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea , manned by the very young , protecting us , yet at the same time menacing the first time i read his description of the waitress in the diner in maine , so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy , i had never met that kind of person before since then i have worked with many just like her my favorite part was when steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in maine also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous top 40 songs on the radio , last generation 's castoffs as today 's antiques , and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place steinbeck got road weary halfway through the book , his dog got sick , and everything seemed wrong he witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s the badlands and the south creeped him out , and he could n't wait to get back home is n't that just the way a real trip works \?
i love steinbeck , so i try to read what ever he has written this book was a total surprise , it is so diferent from his other books i think this would appeal to people who are not steinbeck fans for the loyal reader it is a surprise to see his veiw of a country on the bring of the interstate revolution he observation of trailor park life is great , and i hear you can see the truck that he drove at the steinbeck museum in california
steinbeck 's novels are some of the most powerful statements about american culture available on the planet but who knows the writer \? travels with charley lets readers get to know john steinbeck , how he thinks , what he believes in , all with great wit and intimacy steinbeck is a very funny man i even learned a new respect for poodles what else could you want in a book
this is one of the best , most enjoyable books ever written , in my opinion it is a combination history \( of a now by gone america \) , essay \( on what it means to be american , on the coming modern world , on racism , on travel , even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking \) , memoir , history , travelogue and poem steinbeck sets off with his dog charley in a glorified pickup truck to see america in 1960 he explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states he meets people , he offers opinions , he converses with his pal charley , and he offers a comment on america past , present , and future i find this a fascinating , thoroughly enjoyable \( and i 'd even say classic \) read and i would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on america and travel with charley and the great author who drove him around for those familiar with john steinbeck only as a writer of fiction , this book reveals a new side , and one i think you will enjoy
why are the three most powerful forces in our world evolution , democracy and capitalism so controversial \? hundreds \( in the case of democracy , thousands \) of years after they were first understood , we still ca n't quite believe these three phenomena work socialist europe resists capitalism , the religious right in america questions evolution and the middle east makes a mockery of democracy when you think about it , it 's easy to understand why all three are radically counterintuitive one person , one vote \? what if they vote wrong \?
the first half of the book is simply as good as it gets each kelly pronouncement reads like a mantra from on high the second half of the book is merely brilliant , but mr kelly gives you a pretty good run for your money at 500 pages there 's only a couple of people even close to kevin kelly in the futuristic field , ray kurzweil , howard bloom , and thomas l friedman alvin toffler may have pioneered in a field that h g wells started , but the new mavens like robert d kaplan , mike davis , and kevin kelly , achieve levels of literacy as beautiful as a dali there are about ten must read human futures , out of control is one of them
this is kevin kelly 's own summary of his bottom line conclusions
out of control is packed full of thought provoking ideas and ways of thinking wired magazine readers will find greatly expanded versions of articles included in this book a must read for forward thinking technologists do n't confuse this book with some fluffy marketing rant because it is n't
it is always useful to revisit the future predictions of some time ago what used to be a long time has changed now , five yers is a long time while time has show the truth of the book , the questions and difficulties have changed new difficulties of inclusio
a well though out , easy to understand overview of complexity theory kelly highlights several of the top researchers in the field \( at the time \) and gives countless real examples from the natural and artificial worlds from prairie fields to robotics , biosphere 2 to genetic algorithms the ideas in out of control will make you think
this book was published in 1994 ! we are just beginning to feel the changes things are changing rapidly , but not randomly there is order to the crazy times we 're in the book offers rules to live by in these changing times
kevin kelly 's book , written a decade ago , is , for the most part , still relevant today anyone interested in the subject matter is encouraged to read it , with the exception of those already well informed on the workings of mobs and virtual evolution it is worth noting that kevin kelly 's book is available online at his website
as reviewed
john mccain 's book is verywell written i found the advanced vocabulary outstanding the way the book is put together is very hitorically orientated he starts with his grandpa and the impacts he made on john 's life , then about his own father and the sacrafices that helped shape his faith how he did in the navy and being shot down finally he tells you about his struggles in 'nam and how his hardships there helped make him a better man a really good biography and tribute , john mccain for president god bless pow mia not forgotte
mccain et al write very well and i was impressed by his style the writing was not the only style with which i became familiar but the style of the man himself , john mccain this was a truthful , revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less than honorable profession we can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father i believe this read is one to add to one 's readings of autobiographies biographies
i usually stay away from bios of politicians , especially reads on living politicians who frequently write to exonerate excuse justify blame etc this book is a great read sice mccain 's political life is purposely avoided sen mccain , obviously and justifiably proud of his heritage , spends a good deal of time delving into his family tree coupled with naval and military history , this potion of the book is interesting , though i felt a little too detailed his war time experiences are horrific and inspiring the bravado i expected to accompany his experiences was not there he is a man who had a job to do and he did it he suffered greatly , and he explained his weaknesses he is straighforward and shows a personal and vulnerable side not shown in his political discussions highly recommended for anyone who wants to appreciate true hardships the power of the human spirit to shine
john mccain 's autobiography is a stirring account of perseverance and family values that is ultimately a tribute to the will of humanity to prevail if only more fathers would give their sons the lessons that john sr instilled in john , our world would be a better place if only more men had the unwavering self confidence that john had as a pow , we could all live inspired john mccain shows us that we can grow as people if we learn to do what 's right in the end after all , he was n't perfect , but he learned to hold his head high and make his life as perfect as it could be with what he had outstanding , altogether
this is not the type of book i usually read however , i am so glad i dispensed with my usual fare to read this book john mccain 's account of his family , his years at the naval academy and how those years molded him , his funny , entertaining and low key style are wonderful his matter of fact recounting of his appalling six year captivity as a pow of the north vietnamese is sickening and shocking he writes about his captors , whose beatings , starvation and abuse were a way of life for him and other american prisoners , with amused comtempt , not bitterness or rancor since i hated them about three pages into his story of his years in prison , i find that remarkable probably helped him keep his sanity
ok , i ca n't really say what i thought of the book , as i bought it as a gift for my dad i knew he would enjoy this book without reading it myself and i was right he thoroughly enjoyed it and read it very quickly i would give it 5 stars , but since i did n't actually read it and am only going by what my dad said , it gets 4 solid stars
'faith of my fathers' is the story of three men the grandfather and father of john mccain , who created a legacy of a life in service for mccain \( the third man \) to follow it is their legacies that led the young john mccain to the naval academy and to a career in the navy yet the legacy of these two men is wrapped up in morals , values and patriotism exactly what makes john mccain the great leader that he is
autobiography that starts two generations ago those readers accustomed to the usual self serving political memoir will be plesantly surprised mccain 's book begins with mini bios of both his father and his grandfather , hence the title while the early third of the book dealing with his family tree may be a bit slow going once he gets into his own bio in the middle third , the book really starts to heat up

what a terrible story , was unable to finish it , stuart woods was at one time a very good author , but when he started with holly and stone , he in effect quit writing , this is about a militant band of right wingers robbing banks and oh by the way just had to kill holly 's intended just an hour before the wedding which did n't seem to break holly up all that much as she still has her best friend , her dog and her father which she has conversations with regarding three somes and their sex lives in general , signet books and stuart woods should both be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market
after an impressive debut in orchid beach , we meet holly barker on her wedding day a day that is destined to become a fateful day instead of a happy one woods paints a picture of a heroine who seems more interesting in solving the bank robbery than mourning the loss of the man she supposedly wanted to spend the rest of her life with in a painfully dreadful narrative , woods presents us with another variation on the extremist group of fanatics who want to make the us better by getting rid of anyone who is n't white been done so many times before , that it 's redundant in this tepid story woods does n't offer us anything new and the pacing is so slow , it becomes sleep inducing woods also makes the mistake of having ham , holly 's tough father , carry the weight of the book while ham 's an okay guy , he comes across as a dirk pitt or superman in this one , and it just did n't work for me the ending is also pretty lame , and even the inclusion of stone barrington , makes little narrative sense a real disappointment is the third any better \? \?
good read , enjoyable , but i have to complain on two points
i 've been enjoying the stuart woods series of books lately been reading more stone barrington novels , but i wanted to pick up and see what holly barker was up to in her sophomore effort
holly barker is the cities police chief and is accompanied by her best friend daisy , her doberman pincher the book starts with holly waking up on the morning of her wedding day however , her day takes a sharp downturn when her fianc s murdered during a bank robbery that turned violent holly leads the official investigation with the aid of her friend in the fbi the investigation leads her to a town that is not shown on any maps the inhabitants are white supremacists who recruit holly 's dad ham into joining their organization ham pretends to join this group and is quickly given a key role within it his infiltration of the group enables the law enforcment agencies involved to learn that ham is selected to assassinate a vip , but no one knows whom the intended victim is unless they can learn the identity of the target , someone will die
orchid blues is not a heavy , deep , dark mystery now that that 's out of the way , the book is a good read if you 've read orchid beach you are already familiar with the characters and the writing the hook is holly 's fianc \? being killed in cold blood at the beginning of the story the real star in this story is ham he is able to infiltrate the group of underground militia that murdered holly 's fianc \? yes there are several lucky breaks , but you know what this is a work of fiction
stuart wood 's orchid blues is a fast read his chapters are short , making you want to read on amp on having only read one of sutart 's books \( orchid blues \) , i am definitely going to read more of them you know there 's violence you know there 's mystery you know there 's accuracy i read it so fast , i did n't even look at the back to see how it ended ! now that 's a good mystery ! and no swearing i am now going to read blood orchid and since holly meets up with stone , i will then go on to read the series of crime scenes he 's involved in thank you , stuart woods
if you want to understand iraq , or war in the modern age in general , i think you must read this book most wars are simply unwinnable as that term is commonly misunderstood in hollywood terms wwi and wwii were the exceptions not the rule where an when you must fight an unwinnable war , it must be by necessity and with a clearly defined objective and exit strategy this book illustrates these lessons vividly through the life , courage and devotion of a little known and less understood and altogether mystifying and facinating true american hero even if you are not so interested in the politics and the present day relevance , it 's still one great read
again , i read this book for insight into the ferocity of the asian warriors in modern times since the book of revelation prophesies of a gaint world war iii with asia in the tribuation from which we are not far
it 's generally accepted that vietnam was the first real television war , where images from the front lines were constantly bombarding the senses of the american people this means vietnam in all likelihood started the complex and convoluted mind games that governments have been required to play since in order to meet your aims , as a government , you need to convince your public that the ends justify the means showing dead children on television makes that a difficult message to swallow enter the age of flak
subtitled john paul vann and america in vietnam , this 1988 non fiction book won the pulitzer prize and the national book award and i can well understand why i'm an avid reader of books about vietnam however , this 790 page epic , with an additional 70 pages of acknowledgments , footnotes and indexes , makes all those other books seem lightweight sixteen years in the writing , every word has been scrupulously researched not only are there detailed descriptions of the battles , however the reader is given the opportunity of looking at the really big picture of the politics of the time i'm not talking just about the national politics though there were politics inside the military and between the americans and the south vietnamese we read about real people and the human disaster and the interwoven complexities of waging this war and , central to the book , we learn about of lt colonel john paul vann whose opinions of how the war could be won often differed from those of his superiors but we learn more than just about his military expertise we learn about the man himself we never really like the man and yet , we do come to understand him with all his warts and demons
john paul vann was deceitful , manipulative , selfishly ambitious , driven by inferiority to crave leadership positions , selfish , a sex addict , a serial adulterer , a horrible husband , a lousy father but , john paul vann was also courageous , resourceful , a natural leader , a shrewd judge of others , intelligent , an original thinker , a warrior for freedom , tireless , energetic , and confident
historical events occur twice , one wooly philosopher claimed his follower added , the first time as tragedy , the second as farce not true , america 's wars suggest it 's tragedy all along , and that 's why you need to read or re read this book now
seventeen years after publication , sheehan 's book , imho , remains the best single volume about the war i wo n't heap even more praise upon it in light of what many others have already written , but i plead with the publisher to bring out an abridged volume i 'd assign it to my college classes if it were half the length of its nearly 800 pages
if i were stranded on a desert island with only one book to read about the vietnam war , sheehan 's a bright and shining lie would undoubtedly be it the book is not a linear history of the vietnam war but instead tells the tale from one of its most important players and critics , john paul vann , who served as an in different capacities from the advisory period under kennedy in 1962 to just after the 1972 north vienamese easter offensive , when he was killed in a helicopter crash
had it not been for the movie it was the basis for , i would never have learned a big slice of the truth about vietnam , and i'm thankful i found a softbound copy of this for just the equivalent of us 4 95 in philippine pesos last year
what an exciting and most interesting book ! carol oja takes us back to a transitional period in the cultural history of new york city \( and america \) the 1920s it is n't that book does n't talk about anything outside of those years , but that the stuff before leads into that decade and the stuff after discusses how it flowed from those times probably the best place to start reading this book is the fascinating appendix that lists the programs of modern music societies in new york from 1920 31 it gives you a flavor for the decade and the material the book is going to cover
this is the best selection to buy of hawthorne 's short stories because it is not a selection , it is complete and , if you believe the editor , it 's actually more accurate in its assessment of what is and is not a hawthorne story than some complete collections because he did not include here some stories that his co editors on the hawthorne centenary edition did want to include \( hawthorne spent much of his career as an underpaid and unsung magazine writer and some of his work went with no byline and without reprinting at his own choice , so what he wrote is no easy matter to decide \) the stories are , you probably know if you 're looking up this book , stark and wonderful but some of them are also twee and a little fanciful and not so wonderful that too is instructive one very useful thing about this volume is that it includes a listing of when each story first saw print in magazine form and when in book form in that way the reader can chart hawthorne 's development as a magazine writer and a professional which in every possible sense of the word he determined to become and despite some difficult odds finally was some of the most beautiful and terrifying stories in the language and a beautiful object to hold in your hand expensive , but if you can get it this is the one to buy
i love the womens murder club books i 've read them all in the past month now , i ca n't wait for the 6th to come ou
exciting and well written easy to read keeps your attention
the women 's murder club , introduced to legions of new fans in 1st to die and continued to wonderful effect in 2nd chance , is an intelligent , plausible , modern idea whose time has come lindsay boxer , a police lieutenant in charge of san francisco 's homicide division , cindy thomas , lead crime reporter for the san francisco chronicle , jill bernhardt , assistant da and claire washburn , chief medical examiner , are four sharp , rising professionals in the field of law enforcement who have broken the proverbial male glass ceiling and have discovered the synergy of brainstorming their way to a solution of their mutual problems
no one would argue that this thriller is great literature but if you are looking for something good to read on the beach or a long airplane flight , this is just the ticket \( so to speak \)
i found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend 's house i asked my friend if shed read it and she said , not yet , but it 's a patterson , so it must be good wrong er words were never spoken
this book reads like it was written at top speed by patterson and gross on speed \( just kidding , guys , do n't sue me \) and that 's the way i read it , too i do n't think i drew a breath until the last page
once again james patterson wrote a great book i love this series with the women 's murder club the character are great i read this one in one day
when i first heard that a member of the women 's murder club was going to die , i knew it would n't be lindsay but i always knew who it would be from the beginning of the book and no i am not going to tell you the story centers around a terrorist like cell that is killing upstanding citizens , calling themselves august spies with a few red herrings here and there , the women 's murder club has their work cut out then cindy starts recieving emails from one of the cell detailing when and where they will strike next then in a twist one of the club is killed leading the investigation in a whole new direction the end is sweet with love on the horizon for lindsay all and all it is basic james patterson fare
in 3rd degree james patterson not only produces great thrills and fantastic characters he also provides a very profound message that is surprisngly scary this book is fiction but something like this could very well happen one day considering the story focuses alot around protestors the august spies bomb this house in the first two chapters and as lindasy and the womens murder club delve deeper they realize a surprising motive which leads to sadly , one of the women from the club to be murdered like with pattersons last two murder club series there are those classic little twists and an even better ending that makes you feel satisifed but unlike the last two this one delt more with politics and was very confusing at times there was also more characters than usual and it was very confusing because alot of the characters had aliases which made it very confusing because you could n't figure out which character from the august spies was which the way this book ends may for some people like me , send a chill down your back even though there is a typical happy ending but the message is very surprisng once again patterson proves why he is one of the best if not the best at writng thrillers
richard middleton convincingly argues in this well written book that the influence of pitt during the war has been hyped pitt showed no system for winning the war and his descents on the french coast were political expedients to avoid sending troops to germany pitt was not prime minister as the office did not exist instead he worked as one of two secretaries of state , who , along with the treasury , made up the ministry the book focuses on the politics and administration of the war , and not on the battles and campaigns themselves interestingly , the author shows how historians before the early 1900s were sloppy , and how modern historians often rely on their work without doing their own proper investigation
i loved this book ! it was such a fast read i ca n't wait to get another one
sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian this book is awful the storyline is weak and predictable , the dialogue is excruciatingly lame , and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry there is virtually no romance , which is the reason to read sparks' books i ca n't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said , the way the dog seems to be human , and the predictability of the plot this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it if you want a good plot with romance mixed in , read message in a bottle or a walk to remember if you want suspense , read mary higgins clark or agatha christie they do a far better job with it than sparks does
i love nicholas sparks books i really love the notebook because it reminds me of one of my loves the guardian was great , like many others , i could n't put the book down i hope he does a lot more stories with mystery involved , after reading one of the reviews , it just goes to show that you can not tell a book by its cover come on , nicholas , more , more , more keep up the good wor
i absolutely love all of nicholas sparks' books i have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you get your kleenex 's ready you ca n't go wrong here
i really love this story ! i'm used to the romantic stories that he write but this one sparks included mistery unresolved mistery , , , oh my i really ca n't put it down !
i have only read a few nicholas sparks books \( the notebook the wedding \) , so i was eagerly anticipating beginning the guardian , which had been recommended by me i absolutely love sparks' style of writing , and he did not disappoint with the guardian from the very first chapter , i was captivated i felt like i was right there with julie and singer during all that ensues throughout the book \( i do n't want to spoil anything ! \) i laughed , i cried i think i went through every emotion by the time i finished this book that , to me , is the mark of a great book ! i definitely recommend this book it 's a quick read and a great story that will not disappoint
i loved sparks book the notebook and added most of his books to my must read list i really liked this book , he kept it interesting , but the notebook was much better

this book has been passed around and passed around in my family between family memembers and friends everyone who i know that read this book fell in love with the characters especially the hereo in this book you ca n't help but cry when reading it i am a nicholas sparks fan from all of his books this is one of my favorite and would recommend anyone who has ever had a bet that was as close as a family member read this book you will fall in love
only one other city is so steaped in architecture history than chicago and this guide does a commendable job of highlighting the most important chicago buildings , the synopsis on each building is susinct , the only qualm i have is that there are not more pictures , i also wish the authors had ventured more into the suburbs and commented on some of the great houses in lake forest and highland park , but that omission does not mar the overall enjoyment of this scholarly guide if you are interested in architecture at all , i recommend you pick up this book , chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples
i could n't bring myself to give five stars to a book which is just a review of fifty \( plus \) other books review books seem like a great idea , but the problem with many of them is that they are , frankly , boring ! this one is different whilst giving an accurate overview of each book , the author brings his own style and intelligent commentary into the review , such that the reader really does go away knowing which of the books he or she does want to make time to read from cover to cover we business executives are frantically busy trying to manage the new economy and few of us have time to get to all the background reading we know we should do writing the new economy gives us a genuine shortcut , and is the kind of easy read we can pick up on a train or plane trip , and gain real personal value \( well , i did ! \) and it 's bang up to date at least it will be for a few months before the next tranche of e books hits the streets ! this one is a make time to save time book , and i for one am glad i made time for it
the content of the book was a great resource for me in developing advanced strategies as a business systems analysis it provides clear cut details that can be applied effectively and economically
business systems engineering is an excellent resource for anyone interested in creating a world class organization the tools of business systems engineering allows you to transform a company into a learning organization capable of strategic change and excellence the emphasis on adult learning theory and its role in reengineering the work process is particularly refreshing because strategic change and leadership begins with learning , the emphasis on the work performed by cross functional teams of employees is essential to creating a learning organization that can successfully respond to challenges in the marketplace case studies emphasize organizational learning and looking outside the box , and demonstrate the use of benchmarking to identify the best business practices and applying them to creating a competetive advantage watson 's holistic view of business systems as open systems that are capable of improvement , easily promotes the integration of tqm principles and the use of information technology the result of this synthesis is the business system engineering model the model allows you to transform your organization without sacrificing your focus on quality or the customer , and is adaptable to any business it also helps you to realize the value of employee training to support change initiatives for profit if a change in your organization 's culture is the prescription , then business systems engineering is the treatment
i found this book incredibly helpful as a novice pet owner of a stubborn new puppy the book is written with the necessary instructions for training , but also with humor to keep you interested and engaged the book is so entertaining , i have even recommended it to friends who do not even own pets
we have the most adorable golden retriever , jake however , jake is rambunctious and without kathy santo 's dog sense , he would still be tackling kids behind the knees in over excited play
kathy santo 's book is sure to be a helpful aid to anyone with a dog and if you 're considering adding that adorable puppy to your family , bring the book home first ! the book is written clearly with some humor and the child that says please can we have a dog , i 'll take care of it will gain much knowledge from this book as well
this very informative book certainly helped me train my golden puppy when all other attempts failed the book is concise , informative and written with a delightful sense of humor it would have been so much easier training over the years had i known about kathy santo 's technique everything she says makes so much sense and is applicable to all dogs i'm giving the book to all my dog loving friends for an x mas present this year dog sense certainly makes sense
i have 2 dogs who are so different from one another this is the first book that takes each dogs' personality into consideration when training your dog the book is definitely the best i 've read on dog training and i 've read alot on this topic !
i bought kathy santo 's dog sense at the same time i bought a bernese mountain dog puppy this puppy was my first large dog , and kathy santo 's book gave me the confidence i needed to train her properly from day one i had it by my side during the first months of my puppy 's life , and , a year later , i still refer to it for useful advice and ideas i highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a no nonsense approach to establishing a lasting relationship with their dog
this book has great insight into understanding who your dog is and how to get your dog to behave in many situations the book is written clearly so you can easily train your dog on your own it has been a big help to me and both of my dogs

kathy may have been doing dog training for 20 years but she is n't staying current with what 's happening in dog training sure she implies that she is using positive training because she 's using food , but she 's also telling people how to correctly leash pop their dog even with the food training she 's using 'okay' as a release word which means that anytime that your dog hears this word in a conversation around it , it is ok for it to break from whatever behavior it was currently doing
kathy santo gives good , well thought out advice for training dogs it would have been nice if she went into more depth on the subject of problem behaviors
the book was definitely interesting , and i learned many things about myself that i did not know however , the secret to happiness was not found in here not sure if i went in looking for too much , but it seemed to me like just when he might have been going somewhere , it ended
this book by social psychologist jonathan haidt is a great read even if there is nothing exactly new in it its strength lies in its breadth and consolidation of information
i have written three happiness books in finnish thus i know how hard it is to write something which is not too simple or too difficult there are many books that promise too much , but this is not one of them what i especially like is the tight story everything hangs nicely together i am able to compare the books written by academic psychologists , because i have all the major happiness books this is really on top it covers the major areas , is very well written and does not promise too much i want to warn you about the books whose title is something like happiness now or how to be happy it is extremely difficult to raise your happiness level

a fantastic , wonderful book ! as a journalist researching my own book at the moment , i read it with yellow hi liter in hand i practically drained the thing dry , highlighting illuminating paragraph upon paragraph dr haidt is a positively engaging writer , you have a sense of who he is personally in addition to what he has to teach you and i noticed one of the earlier reviewers complaining that some of the research haidt cited is 30 years old well , so what \? some of the research is even more ancient than that , if you count his quoting buddha , john donne and confucius the happiness hypothesis is fresh , it 's smart , it sparkles and it 's right up there on my bookshelf along with diane ackerman 's fantastic books \( the alchemy of mind is a similar gem \) the category darn ! here 's another book i wish i had written
this is a collection of often old studies that the author has collected \( i learned about the harlow monkey experiments in college 30 yaers ago \) his earth shattering conclusions include that we should strike a middle way between spirituality and materialism , and that often after people have bought something that they always wanted they are dissappointed at the climax of the book he states that in order to be happy we need loving meaningful relationships and a job that provides us with satisfaction what a shocka ! ! ! !
the happiness hypothesis is an extraordinary book i 've read many books on happiness , and this is by far the best it addresses ten issues concerning happiness \( e g , does adversity make us stronger \? is a virtuous life likely to be a happy life \? \) in a lively , very readable style author haidt gives just the right level of detail , and brings together a wonderfully entertaining combination of psychology and philosophy he makes reference to most major religions , but the book can still be enjoyed regardless of one 's personal beliefs \( except for someone who does n't want to read about any faith but his her own \) haidt 's references to psychological research can be easily understood by laymen \( like me \) and seem to be quite up to date i highly recommend this book
if ever you wanted to know what direction to take your life , you have found it it will keep you on the narrow path and give you all the data to weigh the important decisions you make in your life this book is now a staple gift i give
bits of wisdom fly at us constantly from fortune cookies and the like perhaps because of this , you may only rarely stop to savor a great idea and make it your own author jonathan haidt provides a remedy to modern habits of superficial thinking with this accessible update on 10 great ancient philosophical themes , examined within a scientific framework of positive psychology he demonstrates that the questions of the ages are still worth kicking around we recommend this book to those who want to know why change is so difficult and happiness so elusive it will give you plenty to think about and possibly change your life at the least , it will point you in a positive direction
when i was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis my rheumatologist told me that my only option was to go on heavy medication with way too many side effects being pretty much a health nut this news caused serious panic to say the least after a year of searching for alternatives and taking this awful medication i found this book i am so happy to see that there are other options that are successful i am not better yet , but working closely with my naturopath and using this book as a resource i am making steps to my recovery i encourage anyone going through any autoimmune disorder or anyone truly interested in what they are consuming and how it can effect one 's health , to read this book
i suffer from both ra and ankylosing spondolitis i found out through this program that i cannot eat wheat , milk or dairy products , eggs , sugar or coffee when i'm good at sticking to it , i'm almost in complete remission when i cheat , i pay for it within 20 minutes of consuming one of the above items , my fingers begin to swell and get stiff , and by the next morning i'm in a lot of pain i have been able to stop taking the methatrexate and lodin which were very hard on the liver and destroyed my immune system this is a really great program and it works if you have the discipline and self motivation to go through it and stick it out if you are completely lazy and looking for an easy fix , this may not be for you it 's hard ! it has been hard for me to give up coffee , lucky charms for breakfast , hot chocolate , cookies and some other comfort foods but in the end i have a lot of new favorites , my inflamation and pain have disappeared , i 've lost weight and my skin looks fabulous to boot god bless barbara allan ! she 's an angel
maybe i'm being shortshighted , but i feel as if the many concessions i already have to make with this disease are hard enough to incorporate into my daily life , without also including such intense dietary changes i work full time , including travel and client entertainment making it very difficult to always control every morsel i consume also , do n't share the author 's background and early diagnosis symptoms mine are coming more slowly and i am entrusting my treatment and long term care to my rheumy sort of wish i had spent the money on a good yoga or meditation tape instead
there are a number of books about food intolerances that are invaluable to people who have chronic health problems without knowing the cause of their problems since physicians are often ignorant in the area of type iii or delayed onset food intolerance , these books are often the only hope for people to regain their good health and in many cases their lives barbara allen in her book conquering arthritis contributes detailed information to the topic that i have not seen in any other book her own story is inspiring and her systematic approach to solving her personal health crisis mystery is a blueprint for others to find their personal way back to good health to her credit she did not only fight and win her own battle with ignorance , pain and deteriorating health but had the drive and compassion to get the message out there to help all of us with her excellent research and conclusions i was diagnosed with ibs and fibromyalgia and arthritis and insomnia and chronic fatigue and cts and was offered lots of prescription drugs , some of which i took for a while , but nothing helped like avoiding the foods to which i am allergic barbara allen made me aware of hidden additives in foods and vitamins that i needed to stop eating but that i would not have suspected thanks for sharing , barbara allen ! !
fantastic book ! a must buy for anyone with any type of inflammation problem , food allergies , or anyone that just wants to be healthier and feel better
outstanding if you have rheumatoid arthritis get this book practice it and your life will change barbara has done an excellent job of combining personal experience , reviewing the scientific literature and inspiring the reader , to produce a life changing book she goes through extraordinary lengths to find answers to the disease that once haunted her and comes up a winner and you can get the benefit of her vast experiences and research for the cost of a book
what happened to the other 34 reviews of this book you used to have posted
i cannot express what a blessing this book is in our lives my husband 's arthritis began at only 22 years of age and it was progressing fast no one in my family has this disease and i did not know where to turn except a specialist we saw a specialist for a few years , and i always asked was there nothing more we could do to cure the arthritis \? i could not believe that he would have to be on medication for the rest of his life since he was in his early twenties , this would mean years and years of constant , daily medication of course this would eventually mean problems with other parts of his body due to medication intake i still did not know where to go to find a cure rather than just an immune supressant then , he came home one day after an appointment with his doctor involving a new set of x rays he was now being told that his bones were starting to be eaten away and bones in his left hand had most likely fused together he was still only 27 at this point ! i could not imagine what permanent consequences would come over the next years and i could see him not being able to play with our little boy or do anything with his hands in the future this pushed me to stop at nothing to find the cure i knew it had to be out there , but where \? after tons of research and reading , i found the cure ! ! ! i cannot begin to express my thanks to the author and her research and her sharing with the world i just ca n't understand why the medical community does not know , or if they know , why they do n't share the knowledge my husband is in college and this very night was studying rheumatoid arthritis in his anatomy class they have no information on how diet and food sensitivities can cause ra and they state they know of no cure or really good medications it just blows me away that millions of people suffer when the cure is out there , available , and really not difficult if you or someone you know has ra , please get a hold of this book ! i was unsure about the cost , but boy am i glad i tried it out anyhow ! we found that corn is his sensitivity , which makes cooking a little more tricky at first , but once we figured out what he can and cannot eat , we are doing great ! it took a little effort in the beginning to find the ingredients that will work , and we had to adjust recipes , but he eats totally normal in fact , we all eat more healthy now and i do n't mean bran and tasteless food we eat everything we ate before , but now it is fresh and from scratch he has been off all medication for almost 6 months now and we are on our way to complete recovery his right hand is totally normal now , and we are soon going to try the recommended trigger point method to fix his fusion the info here works ! ! ! ! ! ! it takes dedication and a short lifestyle adjustment , but what a blessing everything in this book has been an answer to many prayers ! thank you ! !
barbara allan 's story of how she regained her health is truly inspiring every time i read it , i find another bit of information that i can try or pass on to my mother who has severe osteoarthritis we found the chapters on exercise and diet particularly helpful to us both ms allan has provided a well researched and clearly written book that should be read by all those suffering from severe arthritis as well as those who are experiencing some of the early symptoms thank you , barbara
like catherine maurice , i have two children that were diagnosed with autism at age two one in 1994 and the other in 1996 i am a registered nurse and a long time autism advocate my kids are at opposite ends of the spectrum at this point but both were very severe at diagnosis i cannot help but wonder what field ms albert is in perhaps a restaurant reviewer \? she appears to have so little basic knowledge of autism , its symptoms and effective evidence based treatments do you have or know any children with autism ms albert \? the maurice kids displayed very classic signs of autism and the doctors that diagnosed them and later published a study detailing their descent into autism and recovery are some of the most respected autism experts in the country to question their credibility and the reality of her children 's diagnosis just makes ms albert look foolish and to actually endorse martha welch 's holding therapy , which borders on child abuse , along with other useless or unproven treatments just adds to the absurdity of her claims
as a special ed teacher of an autistic classroom , i found this book very interesting it was written at a time when aba treatment for autism was a little known and cutting edge treatment , whereas now you can barely google the word 'autism' without countless aba references as a result , ms maurice describes a journey through a world of therapy options that have fallen by the wayside in today 's treatment world play therapy , holding therapy , and the like this book is famous because it helped , in part , to make aba the widely used therapy it is today
first the good points
i'm a speech therapist and have given this book to families to encourage them to get intensive early intervention it 's been a great tool as far as that is concerned , in showing families an 'up close and personal' account of what intervention can do i read the book myself a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it most of the reviews here are from people who have an autistic child in their lives , however , i would recommend it to anyone as an autobiography it really flows and the emotional involvement you feel with the family is made stronger by knowing these are real people , not fictional characters
this book touched both my husband and me as parents of a little boy that is 2 1 2 and severly affected by asd i emotionally connected with the author , and was so glad to hear a story of hope i know realistically that outcomes vary , but as a mom , it is therapeutic to hear an uplifting experience like the author 's
a must have in this field for parents and professionals alike
this book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with asd
i 've read some of the other reviews of this book and overall agree with some of the issues raised \( hours of very strict aba to make an autistic child 'normal' at all costs , dismissing special interests as 'perseverations' , etc \) but i want to point out that this book was first written years ago first published in 1993 , and at that point the author is looking back in time by several years , so the actual events probably took place in the mid to late eighties at that point in time there were n't the online support groups , the various autism organizations , the plethora of well known therapies from floortime to affective based language to rdi , or in general much awareness of what autism was at all parents were left to their own devices to do the best they could and , even if i disagree on some points , who out there could start from square one like that and still manage to come up with every answer , something we still have n't managed today \?
i thought this book was all over the place , but maybe that was because i only read it before i went to bed there were flashbacks and flash forwards and i thought the author was trying to be overly clever none of the characters were really that interesting to me it was sad that jean did n't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one wow ! i hope i do n't end up like that when i am her age how could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things what a miserable life ! i am glad this book was short or i would have put it down sooner
once in a while a book comes along that just fits perfectly into one 's life for that particular moment the last odd day is certainly that book for me right now even the clever title , which notes that the date 11 19 99 is the last odd day until the next millennium , leads the reader to be assured that he is in for an amazing journey navigated by a very brilliant mind
i loved this sparse tale about letting go of that which really does n't matter and grabbing hold of that which makes all the difference in our lives
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer , imho it has romance , treasure hunting , and a little magic really great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down i read it several years ago
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters , and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep sea diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed , maybe because i did not want it to end ! also , i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state , the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree , the blue green water , the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read , however i am an avid jd robb reader
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her , it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet , romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book , whether you like romance novels or not
first , let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books , more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read , her stories tend to be very formulaic , and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's , for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before , my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books , this one went against convention in many ways , while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship , but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain , but the love story was touching as other readers have said , i liked how she spread it out over the years , which made it slightly more realistic , and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short , if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan , give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered , but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men , and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream
i realize this is an old title , i 've not had a chance to get to all of the back list , i only first read hiaasen a couple years ago
the mystery of why every single carl hiaasen book has n't been made into a movie has finally been solved suffice it to say that mr hiaasen should be allowed to slap demi moore until her head falls off , and his readers should have the right to go skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was strip tease the movie
i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character , erin , to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i , as a woman , just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did
hiaasen and dave barry in the same office how did anything ever get done at the miami herald \?
i just finished reading strip tease by carl hiaasen i found his writing to be typical hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected , sarcastic and witty in this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past
i would give it an 11 if i could this book is flawless from the first page , i was hooked the characters were the best i had ever read in a novel hiaasen 's humor was incredible i found myself laughing often even though the movie did n't cover as much ground as the book , i think the movie was much better than most people have let on read this book you will love it i have gone through 3 copies , i 've read it so much
i , too , have complained in this forum about the constant delays in the publication dates of this book but when it finally came out , i decided to get it and i'm glad i did
friends , allow me to eat a little crow some of you may recognize me as one of the smart alecks in the amazon discussions forums below many of us were extremely annoyed that this book \( which had been pre purchased over a year ago \) , failed to materialize , even after several postponed publication dates by the publisher some of us grew so disgusted with the delays , we canceled our pre orders i was one of those people but today , guess what the book fairy brought me \? to make a long story short , i 'd forgotten that months ago , in my zeal , i had pre ordered this book from two different places to see which would ship it first , and i only remembered to cancel one of those orders i'm actually very glad i did because in my opinion , this book was worth the wait should you buy it \? read on
wendy wasserstein 's untimely death in the winter of 2006 , at the young age of 55 , robs us of what should have been decades more of her witty , generous spirited but sharp , wise feminst humor these essays are a delight , giving us much over which to ponder and chuckle , even in our sadness , knowing as we do that the mind and spirit creating them have left us read them to savor baby boom feminism in mid life , and to honor the memory of a great woman of letters
wendy wasserstein has won pulitzer prizes and it shows in this book ! of course it 's just chick lit but still very well written , well thought out chick lit that 's a cut above the rest in my opinion it 's not as good as the sex and the city series on tv , that is but heading in that direction !
wendy wasserstein , the acerbic , often hilarious pulitzer prize winning playwright , brings her trademark dry humor to this sweet collection of essays ms wasserstein writes what she knows about theatre , new york city , looking for love , trying to lose weight , friends , and making the decision to have her first child at the age of 48
quick read that 's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children , and how that impacts the adult lives of those children
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good maybe better at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes \? of course not ! why , then , would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books , or a patterson and a connelly , or two thomas harris books my apologies , greg iles , but for a simple , formulaic serial killer book , blood memory was just way too long the book has two co plots one involves a serial killer who murders older men , the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting , but at least two thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles or his editor had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 3o , 40 or even 50 pages , but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera speak , meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths , these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream , taking showers , and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on , greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange , exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before \? just as some people love to hear themselves talk , i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good , blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
if you 're interested in forensics , chances are you 'll like this book the book also manages to tie in sexual abuse , repressed memories , miss , vietnam , ptsd , and a little romance it even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long i was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book 's plot and discussions as intricate as they are
based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes iles is a better writer than grisham , i picked up this book i do n't know if iles can outwrite grisham , but he is definitely a contender i found blood memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists but , it is on the grim side the main character pursues solving two mysteries , one a serial killer on the loose , and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie in the end the two mysteries are related , though i think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first 100 pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it
i guess it 's high praise for mr iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child free diving , drinking , valium , baths in scalding water
one of the boldest of the bold kudos to mr iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists nambla has been put on notice this is work of pure satisfaction , from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero , cat another worthy pile of words from mr iles , despite his ignorance regarding black people the dialog is downright embarrassing , but keep trying mr iles if you hang out with african americans rather than watch them on tv , perhaps you 'll get 5 stars next time
this is the first book i 've read by greg iles however , it will not be the last ! this book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues
as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse i found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person this book will stick with me a long time and i hope even though it is long , readers will give it the chance it deserves i thought this work by mr iles to be very insightful
a pretty decent book and a good read while i do not agree with all of the topics in the book , \( some are a little out of date \) there are some very interesting topics , i especially like the piece about the illusion of free third level education and what the authors purpose instead overall i see the book as an attack on central government and the vast amounts of money they consume in promoting so called good ideas

freedman is the best economist of the 20th century , and this book is the most important book of the last 100 years it is impossible to exaggerate the influence this book has had \( it kick started the free market revolution under reagan and thatcher \) i re read it often i wish all college students read this book , we would have to hear a lot less rubbish , if they did
as time goes by , i have less and less respect for anything milton friedman has to say
i 've read a handful of books that have changed how i think about the world this book is at the top of that small stack
twenty five years after its original publication as the book companion to a pbs series , milton and rose friedman 's free to choose \( ftc \) remains a highly relevant , easy to read , classic tome expounding the virtues of free market capitalism and the flaws and dangers of socialism and government control of the economy
i was a democrat before i read this book i now lean libertarian this book cannot but change at least some of your views on public policy

i am among those who describe j d salinger as america 's least heard from , most missed author
to be truthful , i had never been a big fan of salinger 's before i read this book personally , i found catcher in the rye to be overly dramatic and very cold two story killing traits that are not found in nine stories
before he became a curmudgeonly hermit on the level of a b traven or a thomas pynchon , salinger was a close and sympathetic observer of youth and life amongst the new york upper middle classes the short stories he wrote from the early 40s through the late 50s placed him among the ranks of the best practitioners of the art in all , salinger wrote approximately two dozen short stories , most of which appeared within the pages of the newyorker , along with those of his contemporary john cheever , who was exploring the same territory but with a different emphasis salinger specialized in quirky , high quality tales spiced with equal amounts humor , philosophy , yearning , and sadness , and the far too few stories in this volume are a good representative of his work the emotional trauma of wwii something which affected him personally and perhaps contributed to the man he is now is depicted in differing ways in such stories as uncle wiggily in connecticut , for esme with love and squalor , and a perfect day for bananafish pretty mouth and green my eyes is written almost entirely as dialogue , the laughing man takes as its theme the magic of story telling , while down at the dinghy and teddy illustrate salinger 's famous empathy with children it 's a pity and a mystery that salinger only included nine of his many wonderful stories in this volume apparently , to this day he refuses to allow any of his stories to be reprinted in anthologies , and has withdrawn permission to keep his stories in new editions of such older anthologies as short story masterpieces or fifty great short stories it 's as if salinger the artist for the last forty years has practiced a type of zen self abnegation , erasing not just his present but his past why write if you do n't want to be read \? what purpose , other than self therapy , does art serve without an audience \? \( but do n't despair if you surf the samizdat of the net carefully , you 'll find other stories by salinger \)

one of the books i 've returned to several times , often to just one or two of the stories that i know i can count for a good time despite having such a limited output , i can say without hesitation that salinger is one of my favorites i especially appreciate the glass family stories i love the way the mundane becomes so real and interesting , and often funny check it out ! , even if you 're not a fan of short stories
i absolutely love salinger 's work this collection of short stories is definitely one of the best i know of it shows you the deeply spiritual side of salinger with stories like teddy other stories are so touching i ca n't say enough about them
classic j d salinger at his cynical , crass , sarcastic best loved it
if one would look up the definition of page turner in the dictionary they would not find j d salinger 's 9 short stories among those listed however , if one looked up the definition of a true modern classic \( yes , an oxymoron if ever there was one \) salinger 's collection of short stories would be at the top of the list in bold
salinger was obviously a great storyteller , but the endings to most of his stories are too glamorously shocking to be shocking at all a much better book of short stories would be nine stories minus all the endings despite the ending , teddy is perhaps the best short story i have ever read
nine stories is a collection of stories written by j d salinger , that were published in other media before he made his mark in literature collected in this popular book , we see hints of what makes salinger 's writing an american treasure
history at its most compelling , a well written account that both illuminates the past and provides lessons for the future in the spirit of rick atkinson 's an army at dawn , it ennobles the participants even while exposing their human flaws and foibles i 've read quite a bit of pacific war naval history , and this book does a singularly impressive job of exploring and explaining the japanese mindset to a western reader \( and vice versa , i 'd imagine \)
evan thomas presents an outstanding , extraordinarily researched , and easy to read narrative of one of the pacific 's greatest sea battles in `sea of thunder four commanders and the last great naval campaign 1941 1945' uniquely , and most interesting is the balanced research it is clear thomas completed in order to share a vivid picture of the mind set of the combatants at sear the u s navy appeared to have a view that the japanese navy was not up to their combat ready level , and the japanese navy viewed the u s navy as being made of individuals not willing to sacrifice for their beliefs obviously both perspectives were wrong thomas gives understanding of actions based upon these perspectives in a manner never told before
tony hillerman once again created a fresh and involving entry in his long running series about the navajo tribal police leaphorn has retired in this one , at loose ends after the death of his beloved wife emma chee is the acting lieutinent but may not want it to become permanent there is a little less of the navajo mysticism in this one but the vast territory covered by the navajo tribal police is given its due as always
the disappearance of a scientist and the murder of a navajo tribal police officer coincide , and a hopi is blamed for the murder meanwhile , several navajo have died from bubonic plague \( something they still die from , seriously \) is there a connection \? yes in this one , leaphorn is now a private citizen and chee is acting lieutenant their roles almost seem reversed but they 're still the same old characters i do n't think they had to have janet pete in this one again , i think he should just dump the b
i love the southwest having grown up in salt lake city , california , and visiting my grandparents in mesa , arizona hillerman has created his own unique genre because there is no one who deals with native americans and their own problems this book especially was good because a few years ago they had many young people die from the hantavirus \( hillerman adds the bubonic plague but the hantavirus is the main concern down there with too much water , the pinion trees produce too muchand encourages the population growth of mice and rats who live under the homes of the native americans when their fecal matter dries out , it aerosolizes and exposes the lungs to the virus in the fecal matter the center for disease control had their hands full with that one
i 've read a lot of the books in the series , and hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers , but i have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries my main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author his well crafted mysteries almost always hold water , but not this one i whole heartedly recommend most of hillerman 's other jim chee joe leaphorn novels , but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill , this is not the book to pick up
my mother is japanese and moved to the u s fifty or more years ago she read this book and savored it , rereading passages over and over she delighted in recalling the symbolism and rituals of long forgotten traditions that were explained in this book after hearing her delight in the story and its characters , i could not wait to read it she gave the book to me with the promise that i would return it so she could continue to re read it it was a quick and captivating read for me my only disappointment was reaching the end of the novel and wanting more
i cannot say enough about this book i fell in love with the characters i'm not sure if it 's because my mother is japanese and being stationed in japan that i felt a connection
i loved this book ! i became a fan of gail tsukiyama after reading women of the silk and i continue to be a fan at the end of this book it is so purely and sweetly written there is not a character that i didnt enjoy the customs of old japan was fascinating too she really captured the aches and the longing of these long suffering people , but it was n't written with sadness , but hope this would make a great book club selection
i think i would have liked this book if i had read it when i was 14 or 15 sweet , dreamy , simplistic but i am much older and i was struck by the inconsistencies the young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later i lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel \( in 1938 \? \? \) then there was the secretive , silent , and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked
this is one of the most beautifully written books i have ever read it 's a little too slow paced but the quiet elegance with which tsukiyama describes the characters and their respective love stories is breathtaking
i really loved this book i loved it so much that i bought copies for family members to read i was really touched by the theme of inner strength and hidden strength the devolopment of the characters has grace and beauty to it the idea that beauty is not on the outside , but on the inside is an important theme in literature i would recommend this book to any person who wants to think about the meaning of life and the values we place on beauty and accomplishment in the world
one of my favorite epithets is the child is father to the man , referring not to the obvious persistence of personality , but to the profound impact of child rearing on adult character this is the theme of gail tsukiyama 's wonderful novel , the samurai 's garden
this book was written at a different time a time when segregation for illnesses was the vogue i find that we embrace the same things today it had charm and interest as other cultures attend to their daily lives a charming read
i really enjoy reading historical fiction my librarian reccomended the samurai 's garden to me and i really liked it i did n't like it as much as some books i read on japan but i think it is a worthwhile read i prefer this one to women of the silk , also by gail tsukiyama
i agree with nancy katz 's review , i thought the samurai 's garden was a book to be savored it was such a delightful read , it was powerful , yet at the same time slow moving
i love christiane northrup 's holistic view of our bodies , minds and spirits as someone who has felt alone and crazy at 47 , i am grateful to feel validated and reassured not all things in the book apply to me at this time , but were very interesting and i am glad to learn new information about what is coming this book is great for anyone who is ready to believe in the power they have to manage thier own health
do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish there is factual information here , but it is buried in gushy self absorption i bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause , but i 'd be embarrassed to lend it out
the wisdom of menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman 's body during and after ovarian failure \( menopause \) this book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause \( ovarian failure \) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace i do n't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail , instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer
dr northrup gives us a lot of not only emotional insight but , more importantly and why i bought her book , she gives so much factual information that doctors are too busy to give their patients \( it would take hours to relay half of this information ! \) the information is even more valuable with all of the references and notes she has printed in the back of the book i have ordered the saliva and urine tests she suggested and will see if i learn anything new but , even if i do n't , i feel better about taking responsibility in educating myself about my own health ! a tremendous education even if you want to supplement it with other informational sources
this is the first time i have read something so enlightening concerning menopause dr northrup has a way with words i love the way she writes i thought i knew all there was to know about menopause , and some how she makes me feel more normal
i was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by christiane northrup in this jumble of a book at a time when i needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body i turned to christian northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause a wonderful combination if northrup had chosen to focus on menopause instead she is all over the map , taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life if i wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers , husbands , and daughters i could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life instead , i sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock , as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life if you are a middle aged woman who has stuffed your feelings all your life , and need help speaking up for your youself this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice but if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured , this book will shock you with its pettiness i am quite new age and believe in all the woo woo stuff mentioned in this book but when i turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue that 's what i expect i can only hope that northrup will re read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication i was embarrassed for her and returned it i just do n't buy it in more ways then one
i admit , i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards , interest in astrology and angels granted , i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !
some of the medical information is very helpful my recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35 , it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy , nor is it for someone who has young children at home her hormonal theory , that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families , and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age do i think that my total hysterectomy at 34 \( and the obvious onset of menopause \) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children \? of course not that 's ridiculous , and if i think about it too much , it 's actually offensive
when you think you 're falling apart , by dr kathleen wilson was loaded with current information i could use about myself i think it will be as important as the wisdom of menopause in teaching women how their bodies work , how to keep themselves healthy , how to reduce stress , and how to manage in the medical system
if ever there was a book that belongs in the waiting room of doctors across the nation , this is it ! i am a yoga teacher whose classes are filled with women who begin yoga at a time when they are experiencing the symptoms of menopause i keep this book in plain view and tell my students that one of the most empowering things they can do for themselves is to be familiar with the information in this book to me , christiane northrup is the goddess of menopause , giving all us women in transition a wake up call ! she reminds us that , at midlife our job is to learn how to take care of ourselves instead of everybody else if we do n't learn how to do this , we soon learn that no one will do this for us thank you , dr northrup , for helping us celebrate this liberating , crowning , glorious stage of life !

this book contained a lot of good material concerning the interaction of carly fiorina and her highest level executives however , burrows' coverage of her impact on lower level managers in critical positions was inadequate the failures of such managers can have major impacts on hp for potentially decades and thus deserve scrutiny a good example prior to the fiorina era was when hp lost over 60 points of market share in the technical workstation market in the 1980s which also led over time to a weakened server market position , due to lost technical and financial leverage the current value of this loss may be as high as 10 billion dollars in revenue yearly
peter burrows offers insights into high level business , where personality matters more than economics , as he explores the mammoth hp compaq merger most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised synergies so , he asks , why other than ego do ceos pursue them \? though stylistically somewhat trite , this book successfully explores the hp board 's decision to approve the merger , with walter b hewlett 's vote in favor , and his subsequent lonely , ultimately quixotic battle against it the most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here shareholder rights and value vs ceo power employee oriented cultures vs re engineering corporate integrity vs sharp practice and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless , hard headed female ceo pitted against a sensitive , cello playing man the author says hewlett packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in business week , so there is an inevitable walter hewlett bias we found this to be a very good read , even a must read , for corporate warriors
jean i young 's translation of selections from the prose edda of snorri sturluson tales from norse mythology , with an introduction by the distinguished icelandic scholar sigurdhur nordal , was originally issued in 1954 by bowes bowes publishers ltd , cambridge , with an american edition from the university of california press i have a 1964 hardcover printing of the latter version
i was required to read this text for a college class that i was taking i found the text to be very informative , but confusing to understand at time i still reference this text for the mythology classes i teach , and occasionally i will read parts of it to my students newer translations of this work are easier to understand and a much better read , but this is still one of the orginal texts for norse mythology
tkam is not the finest piece of prose though it does have some terrific \( sometimes humorous , sometimes heartbreaking \) stretches nor is it the most compelling story but it is a story well told , well voiced \( by its very young narrator \) , and well paced above all , it is a story whose themes addressed to the best and the worst in human nature endure , themes that \( one alternately hopes and is greatly saddened to think \) will endure forever for this reason , in spite of its quaint anachronistic feel , tkam is a novel for the ages , and a particularly important read for children i had the special pleasure of listening to tkam narrated by sissy spacek , the perfect voice for scout
i never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend i hesitated to read it , not thinking i would like it , and to my surprise i loved the book not only is it a great read but harper lee is a masterful storyteller whose prose and craft are exceptional i think i may need to reread it in the future
read , re read and re read if you 've read this book more than 10 years ago , you 'll be amazed at its artistry and timeliness if you read it now
i think i was suppsoed to read this book in high school and i either did n't or i watched the movie instead either way , i am glad i finally did this book is one of the best ever written it makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it harper lee was ahead of her time in so many ways buy this book read it now go
this book was simply wonderful and a must read
this is another of those books that everyone tells you how wonderful and incredible it is i read it , and okay it 's a book and a not bad one at that but is it amazing \? is it the greatest , most thought provoking book of all times \? is it truly just overrated \?
this book is really good on many levels theres really 2 stories going on 1 is how these 3 kids spent thier summer this one time , which is its more endearing side and the other story about this chick that got raped and how a racist town wants to pin it on this black dude then theres this creepy boo radley guy and all in all its a great book one of those you have to have read to call yourself educated about literature
i highly recommend this book he starts out examining old societies that failed and why they failed , then slowly moves to modern times however , reading the environmental issues of the day one comes to quickly realize we are not much different from those collapsed societies of the past there is hope , in that by realizing and learning from man 's past mistakes we may be able to protect our world for future generations to enjoy 5 stars
i liked this book although i suspect it will get very mixed reviews diamond gives examples from history of different societies' reactions to environmental problems , including societies that have succeeded and those that have failed then he makes comparisons to contemporary society
another great book by jared diamond he discusses the rise and fall of civilizations including mayans , aztecs , easter islanders , anasazi , etc the environmental , social and cultural factors responsible for the demise of mass civilizations are discussed and integrated this is a fascinating book that will change your view of history and ancient civilizations actually , it 's pretty scary when jd compares the parallels between ancient civilizations that crumbled and our own contemporary civilizations very enlightening and stimulating material ! !
this book shows the various reasons for societies' collapse or success
in his magnum opus , 1984 , george orwell famously wrote , who controls the past , controls the future and who controls the present controls the past this is a lesson that jared diamond has obviously learned well
arrived on time and in terrific shape ! thanks
the book was a very good book i wounder if the high gas prices in parts of europe like holland and other places have anything to do with their chances of seeing december 31 , 2100 \? it makes you realize that the peoples who have at least 10 chance of not seeing 2100 as an intact people are not all primative hunters and gathers , some of such peoples have reached the post industrial level of sophication some of those peoples could easily be the finaciers of all threatened peoples including themselves some examples of state socities that might not be around in 2100 are beglium , the neatherlands , and the small island nations as well as others it just to shows you that maybe we need include the dutch and some others on the list of threatened peoples , which inludes the tribes of the amazon and others , to wake people up on global warming
this is an important book about why societies , ancient and modern , collapse given professor diamond 's background in the environmental movement , it 's no surprise that he sees the reasons as ultimately environmental that is , people in a culture have to choose how they will respond to their environment , and it they choose poorly , they may pay with their lives and the lives of everyone else
jameson thottam with a raising review of collapse
best case book around sixteen stories that are short enough to keep you interested without weighing you down in medical jargon great stories that scan the world , proving that murder and stupid criminals are everywhere
the book was very interesting \( especailly since i am currently studying criminal justice and forensic science \) i found the short stories to be very convenient in allowing me to pick up the book and put it down again with my busy schedule however , i must admit the numerous spelling errors did get on my nerves overall the content was good and i would say the book was worth the read
i read another book by this author , friendship cake , which i really enjoyed and passed around to several friends so i picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read luckily , it only took me about an hour and a half to read it , since that 's about as long as i 'll remember it
this book really fell flat lynne hinton 's first book friendship cake what such a good read i was sincerely disappointed in her second work she had a good beginning , but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant , and a little dull there was some hope of a good plot , but something was definitly missing try again lynne , you have talent maybe try a sequel to friendship cake the characters that you developed in that book are really good
this is not the sort of novel i usually read , but i bought it because malachy mccourt recommended it , and i was n't disappointed it is , indeed , a beautifully written , sweet , sad coming of age story , with a lot of local color thank you , malachy , for recommending this delightful tale
lynne hinton 's the things i know best is set in north carolina , where a home which has housed generations of the ivy women is affected by a special gift which sparks changes and tragedy a twin sister 's experiences and predictions spark conflict and love
it is interesting that out of the many books that i have read this one does not hit me across the head however with that said , i re looked at the book before writing this note and i did mark a lot of text that i found highly useful i particularly liked the solid recommendations for implementing personal and community change at the end of each chapter maybe the fact that the authors do not try wow you with their brilliance but provide solid and easy to follow recommendations is why this book is so valuable the structure also lends itself to a study group within your management team helping to drive implementation of the principles introduced
in this wonderful book , quinn challenges us to confront our own hypocrisy and make a choice between deep change or slow death that is to say between commitment or disengagement it 's actually not an easy choice to make most of us have taken the easy path and chosen not to speak out when w 've known what needed to be changed or , we 've run from a difficult work situation , leaving the problems behind for someone else to clean up , not admitting our part in the failure or taking responsibility for changing ourselves
this is probably the best book i have seen that tackles the theory behind how groups or corporations grow and change over time i found it particularly helpful in seeing our church from an organic point of view the writing is more metaphysical than i like at the beginning , but by working through it , i was better able to understand the remainder of the book
this book is for readers who are ready to look inside themselves in order to change their organizations it is n't a book for novices you need a fair amount of business experience to have the perspective to understand author robert e quinn 's message likewise , you need to have enough invested in your current organization to care if it changes quinn offers some theoretical analysis , but leavens it with ample practical examples and exercises if you have a job , rather than a career , or if you are committed to staying in a narrow , technical field or just waiting for your retirement , skip this book however , if you 're willing to engage in extended self examination , we suggest this to you however , be warned that that many of quinn 's drills are emotionally challenging , such as identifying how you resist change or pegging which elements of your organization are more committed to the status quo than to success but , then , whoever said change was easy
i had read this book at the office \( after reading the newer one building the bridge \) and had to get my own copy i 've begun to do the exercises at the end of the chapter and find that it offers an opportunity for profound reflection on personal and workplace issues this book has challenged me to read my own integrity meter and do the work to move in the right direction
this is one of perhaps four or five of the best books i own that deal with personal business improvement and growth it is obvious that quinn has spent years developing his approach his personal concern for helping organizations businesses individuals change is also evident i would recommend this book to anyone interested in fresh ideas and clear thinking
somehow in ordering the book on your system , i wound up ordering two books one from amazon and one from a used book supplier i was able to resell the second book but very confused how i mistakenly ordered the two copies
while this book has been around for a while , it is a good treament of a valuable concept how we interact with our colleagues depends in many respects on how we and they see the world deep change gives a simple , yet effective framework for that understanding and builds from there the federal emergency management agency uses this book in one of their leadership courses , and i imagine numerous private organizations also use it
the lilting prose and alternating black and white and colorful illustrations make this one of my favorite books to read to my little one there is a reason this book is a classic
this , with goodnight moon by the same authors , is a classic children 's book , and with good reason it 's a nice story with a repeating structure and pattern that children enjoy and beautiful , colorful , two page spread pictures that catch even the eyes of my 5 week old son
this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it it is warm and comforting a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what
i love the runaway bunny and my kids love the runaway bunny it makes us laugh , brings us closer together , and helps reinforce the most important lesson my children can learn a mother 's love has no limits we laughed at the young bunny 's frustration , marveled at the mother bunny 's persistence , and discussed the love and commitment that strengthens our own family the runaway bunny has been a useful tool in reinforcing my dedication to my children as young children enjoyed the pictures it 's small and simple , but the lesson is profound
this book is probably one of my all time favorites
classic book is great in dribble proof format with good reproductions of the original illustrations lots of squirming and hugging while reading this one
i wept the first time i read this to my infant daughter now she 's a toddler and we read it together several times a day it 's a sweet book with wonderful illustrations look for the picture that 's of the same room featured in goodnight moon
i liked it , but i got this with several other books as a set for a very low price so for me , it 's worth the money i think kids would love to read this out loud
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the pre five in a row w our preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother w borderline personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's what so ever \( if i need a break away , she hunts down my poor husband , all my relatives and friends ugh \) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality
i had never read any of dr schlessinger 's books until about a month ago when i read her book the proper care and feeding of husbands it was a magnificent read and prompted me to pick up this one , 10 stupid things couples do to mess up their relationships the problem is , i should have read this book first , and here is why proper care was such a masterpiece that i expected as much from this one , and though it is a wonderful dissertation and full of valuable advice , it does n't come close to being in the same category as proper care had i read this book first , my expectations would not have been as high and i probably would have rated this one higher
dr laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment
self proclamation does not a doctor make dr laura 's credential 's are not within the field of psychotherapy she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness , has been estranged from her own family for years she who points the finger has also had the finger pointed at her posing nude , living with a man without the benefit of marriage , having an affair , becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage , have all been written about dr laura schlessinger and made public noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite , unless of course , they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent
like most reviewers , i found this brief book to be a highly believable warning of the coming huge depression how can you argue with a thesis that accounts for the us economy 's ups and downs in detail for nearly a century ! ! unlike the few , \( like special k below \) , who completely miss the key message , it is demographics that controls everything any economist will tell you that 70 of gdp is simply us \( we are the demographics \) spending our paychecks and , as arnold points out , it 's more like 90 when we add the government 's spending of our taxes which they take from our paychecks arnold 's thesis is a better developed version of noted economist dent 's theory that specific demographics always control where the economy is going it 's not really theory anymore it 's plain commonsense , which is what comes out in arnold 's book dent also predicts a massive mother of all depressions starting around 2010 special k and his ilk , who are quite happy i'm sure to \( correctly \) attribute the coming social security crisis solely to demographics but want to insist that the economy in general cannot possibly be , are the ones that are going to lose everything in what 's coming go read arnold to understand \( concisely without 200 extra pages of added irrelevant fluff \) that demographics is really all that counts and why my god , he even shows how the japanese near depression from 1990 to 2003 was caused by exactly the same demographic data within japan what more do you want \? read it
i was skeptical when i saw the length of the book at just over 50 pages , and with good cause if you are going to present an argument for a depression in the works , you should at least present detail of all of the main issues and present sufficient data to back up your claims merely using demographics as the main argument is not only insufficient , but irresponsible something as major as a depression is very complex and is only triggered from the right sequence of economic , financial and social consequences falling into place finally , this book is outdated and does not address the effects of free trade , the healthcare crisis , social security , underfunded pensions , and many other issues although its under 10 , you would be better off spending more and getting a whole lot more rather than something that should be more appropriately submited as a high school essay
very short , \( 55 pages \) , and to the point , yet , with all of the information packed into the book , it should still take a couple of nights to read if you can put it down mr arnold has a message to get out , and he gets it said
although i agree with mr arnold 's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful , it should be apparent now that the increase in the djia , which the author asserted must happen , has not materialized
while i was expecting to hear a complex tale of economic indicators , the author , daniel arnold , instead took a very simple argument that gdp is driven primarily by 49 54 year olds \( with regards to consumer spending \) and backs this argument up with the day to day djia \( dow jones industrial average \) and population data it is unclear just how accurate his data really is , especially with regards to turn of the century data , but he does go in depth to explain how he obtained it , and how he made it as accurate as he possibly could
this book , if you can call it that , is a waste of money it would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it instead , i would recommend harry s dent jr 's book , the next great bubble boom both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn , but the dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it
this book is short and to the point mr arnold states his theory and then backs it up with research he describes the problem that is comming then he tells you what you should do
the general theory is the main work of keynes and his theory , which is was written to distinguish himself from the classical theory the style is fairly hard to read , as the language is not easy and the contents obviously very advanced nevertheless , reading this book is worth the efforts , as the theory \( so often very badly taught at schools and universities \) becomes crystal clear at the same time , it is a book that should ideally be read by someone who has at least got some basics in economics , as otherwise the book may seem too hard
sitting here is baghdad , one hears often a simple solution to the counter insurgency problem usually it 's some combination of winning hearts and minds and killing terrorists the solution may be closer to burying money in the sand that idea came from john maynard keynes who faced far larger problems than the war in iraq it 's been 21 years since i read keynes' general theory , eighty years since it was first published \( my econ department believed in teaching both major economic choices of the day capitalism and communism so i got some look at both \) what sold me on keynes was his general theory what turned me against marxism were my visits to eastern block countries where i could see its effect on the economy and on humanity there is a heart inside keynes book , the general theory , the same heart that wrote the economic consequences of the peace keynes does get blamed for failed economic policies of those keynesians of the sixties and seventies who believed they could tinker the economy into perfection mistrust developed in keynes general theory but when i read his book , from start to finish , i came to the conclusion that people just did n't finish the book they must have skipped over the second half to believe you could just spend your way to prosperity or reverse bad times with clever monetary policy his theory has worked for 80 years the book may not be for you , but it is a masterpiece , something to be savored as the seminal work which transformed classical economics at a time when the world needed saving , when the alternative , marxism , which stole the heart of half the globe , but would prove capable only of impoverishing and dehumanizing the world owes more the keynes than it acknowledges if you love the history of ideas , it 's a must read or at least it adds a credibility to your library which a select few can appreciate
you can waste your time reading this book , sure go ahead or , you can pick up henry hazlitt 's the failure of the new economics an analysis of the keynesian fallacies and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys keynes and his faulty logic not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable keynes , he shows the reader multiple instances where keynes simply contradicts himself , yet keeps right on chuggin' \( savings investments somehow in his general theory , keynes manages to both prove and disprove this \) he explains in lucid terms that keynes general theory is n't general at all in fact , it can only be applied correctly in static situations in most cases it ca n't account at all for dynamics do n't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage
there is no doubt that john maynard keynes 's the general theory was the most important book about economics of the 20th century hayek and friedman \( and maybe ludwig von mises \) may be thought of as the great minds among academics and professional economists , but when the economy heads southward and these academics and professionals have to advise politicians , they all mysteriously become keynesians reagan and george w being the two greatest examples of this hypocrisy , as both presidents and their economic advisors were keynes bashers , yet both have been the most keynesian presidents in american history
most of the reviews above are political diatribes against keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes the key to understanding keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle , an economy can become over productive \( or under consumptive \) and thus , a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand thus , full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria if an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium , something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment this something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions , it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick , direct way to restore full employment while at the same time , redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over production in the first place although difficult to read , this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics far from being destructive , it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930 's i recommend you read this book
first , let 's write down the core of the classical and or neoclassical theory keynes criticized in the general theory let p equal the price level , w equal the money wage , mpl equal the marginal product of labor , mpc equal the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods , mpi equal the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods \( capital or producer goods like machinery , equipment or factories \) and mps equal the marginal propensity to save for the classical neoclassical theory , the economy is at an optimal state on the boundary of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontiers if the following equilibrium condition holds for the aggregate labor market w p mpl for keynes the condition is w p mpl \( mpc mpi \) neoclassical theory is a special case where mpc mpi 1 keynes 's gt is mpc mpi or 1 mpc mpi is or to mpc mps 1 neoclassical theory is the special case of an econony always operating on the boundaries of both ppf 's under resource scarcity so that there is an inverse relationship between consumption goods and investment goods only in this special case will classical neoclassical theory be operational in a statistical sense , classical neo theory assumes that on average the economy is on its boundary the business cycle would consist of minor inflationary deflationary gaps which would be self correcting through business inventory adjustment alone none of this is operational if the economy is operating in the interior of either ppf 's given the stability of the consumption function , keynes came to the conclusion that the problem was insufficient long run investment due to a highly volatile and unstable mpi in the private sector the result is an investment gap keynes 's solution is not deficit finance but having the public sector borrow the inactive private financial funds at existing very low rates of interest to spend as a special capital account on a continuing series of infrastructure projects which will more than pay for themselves over time if this policy is opposed then keynes would be willing to copy the wasteful policy of the egyptian pharaohs and build a series of pyramids over time although wasteful , such a policy would close the investment gap and lead back to the boundary of the static and or dynamic production possibilities frontier classical neo theory would then be operational as long as the mpi 's unstable behavior was continually offset by increased public sector public goods infrastructure spending
keynes was no doubt an influential economist his theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post new deal economic policies of the united states and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like imf however , his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the u s particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation \( an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to keynesism \) we have keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government read planning for freedom or socialism by ludwig von mises instead
master of the senate is the payoff for the previous two volumes , just as johnson 's senate career is his payoff for almost 30 years of politicking we see him in a political institution whose potential has gone unexploited we see him understand the structure of the place better than anyone alive at the time or , possibly , alive before him we see him take the job of majority whip when no one wanted it , because no one understood the power that was available from that position , and watch him mercilessly exercise that power on those around him it is , i suggest , impossible for anyone or at least any male to read caro 's books and root against johnson it 's the story of a man harnessing power , spiced up every now and again by stories about the sex that that power bought him in particular with alice glass , whom many people in the books describe as the most beautiful woman they have ever seen which male could resist smiling and feeling envious \? \( an exception i think it would be very hard for anyone , male or female , to support johnson against coke stevenson while reading means of ascent \)
i took up master of the senate on the recommendation of a state senate majority leader i began the book with some skepticism because i did not like johnson when he was president and i feel that his reputation has deteriorated since then long before completing this book i was very grateful for the recommendation in it , author robert a caro treats the reader to a work equally great as biography and history he does an excellent job in revealing johnson 's character and accomplishments in the context of the history in which he lived
robert caro is just flat out a great writer i marvelled at half page paragraphs in which he would paint the most intricate and vivid picture about some minor point such economy and elegance i loved it overall , his work on lbj is just awesome
absolutely one of the best biographies i have ever read fascinating , insightful and brilliantly written ! as i finished reading it , i found myself longing for the next installment about the vice presidency and the presidency i will be reading it as soon as it comes out
robert caro has produced another , long masterpiece with the continuation of his biography of lyndon b johnson this is the second caro book i have read and the first lbj book \( the other book was the power broker , his epic about robert moses \)
masterful story of the master of the senate make sure you read vol s one and two they are as good having no interest in lbj before i started the series i ca n't get enough ! look forward to the final chapter this book covers his years in the senate and wow what an interesting man he was a horrible individual who was blind with ambition truely an american legend
i think our current senate would do themselves some good by taking turns reading robert a caro 's master of the senate into the senate record a few times this book is not only a great history of the senate but also of the man who largely shaped the senate into what it is today , lyndon b johnson after reading this book , i must say that johnson is probably one of the best politicians of the 20th century in terms of power , influence , counting votes , and his grasp of the issues johnson is still the youngest majority leader to date and largely defined what being majority leader meant \( before him the position had no power \) after reading this book i ca n't help but laugh at our current senate they seem like a bunch of spineless jellyfish in comparison to the people profiled in this book be it richard russell \( who was definitely wrong on civil rights \) , paul douglas , or johnson himself this book definitely provides a behind the scenes glimpse of senatorial power struggles and back door senate deal making as caro points out amply , johnson truly was a master parlimentarian overall , great prose , great read , and filled with lots of manageable information easy to see how this book won the pulitzer ! and as a side note , the senate freshman of 1948 truly shaped 20th century politics \( johnson , kennedy , and nixon \)
boy is my brain stuffed
there is no way around it this book requires a very real investment of time but what a payoff ! in addition to having a really thick book to put on your shelf to impress your friends , this is one of the greatest biographies over written
flowery verbose rambling compound sentence upon compound sentence this book was unreadable for me i quit
a great improvisation is an involving take on franklin 's years in france during america 's revolutionary era schiff meticulously sets the stage of 18th century paris , a political free for all run on gossip and intrigue , and onto it drops ersatz diplomat and international superstar benjamin franklin
ben franklin is my hero , i have 12 biographies on him , this was the worst i first started collecting franklin biographies forty years ago , van doren , fay , issacson , brands , wood and a half a dozen others at first glance , and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different a new take that concentrated on france well it was new , and very different it put me to sleep in my chair several times i eventually gave up and shelved it with the others what a shame boring
i'm giving up on this book it reads like a first draft sentences like the following on page 71 abound when you hear not so often as you wish , remember , our silence means our safety , the committee of secret correspondence now doing business as the committee for foreign affairs , although franklin , who had never mastered the original name , was not to know for months soothed the envoys , whom they understood to be starved for news
in her book , a great improvisation , pulitzer prize biographer stacy schiff once again sets the standard by which all biographies should be measured in our times somehow , and this is the magic , she combines research and accuracy worthy of the term scholarship with a novelist 's ability to create a world into which readers completely lose themselves as you read , you magically fall into another era , to a time before ubiquitous technology , and when information \( did this word even have the same meaning then \? \) was delayed , imperfect , and unverifiable \( no google \) i could actually feel the noise of all the technology to which we have become accustomed fall away to create a stillness that is then filled with personalities and , benjamin franklin is personality that could fill a room , span an ocean , and make a country
the brilliantly insightful stacy schiff proves yet again that she is , without a doubt , one of america 's most gifted biographers benjamin franklin springs to life here in all his complexity schiff 's elegant prose renders his seven year stay in france utterly fascinating the nuanced portrait of franklin that emerges in these pages will be of great interest to anyone at all intrigued by this endlessly complicated figure and his role in american history i would venture to say that a great improvisation is as compelling as the very best novels the sort that once you 've begun , you simply ca n't put down and this , i believe , is in no small part due to schiff 's prose , which is as lucid as it is graceful qualities much sought after but not often found by discriminating readers one would expect nothing less from this pulitzer prize winning author
schiff 's understanding of the french is the key to this book that plus her lively writing style , wonderful wit , and the sheer craftsmanship of her phrasing and her story telling the book is a romp , through a trying and tedious time in the life of one of america 's and the 18th century 's most trying but least tedious characters
this book provides a fascinating look at the gay and lesbian movement through the lens of politics and society i was intrigued by the quality of the work , the research , and the practicality of the content a must read
this guy sure knows what he is talking about and everyone should read this book three cheers to the author thank you stephen for an honest look at this time perio
i love this book ! being the only vegetarian in my family \( and also being a 'kid' \) makes it really hard to find things to eat that are healthy that i still like the teen 's vegetarian cookbook is the best cookbook i 've ever used the format is fantastic , the instructions are really simple to follow , the recipes do n't usually include strange things or anything that no one would actually eat if you 're vegan , there are lots of really good recipes that do n't contain any animal products at all this book is n't just for vegetarians , though ! i got my whole family eating some of it they added meat to theirs , but they still love the pizza dough i even make the chocolate coma pie for a party and everyone ate it and enjoyed it whether you 're a teen , a parent , someone hoping to eat more healthy but still delicious food , or you were just dared to be vegetarian for a week , this book is the ultimate !
i got this book for my eleven year old daughter ever since we have been enjoying great meals , such as thai coconut curry , on sunday nights when it 's her turn to cook the recipes are easy enough for her to follow without much help , yet hard enough for a challange she is sure to grow up to be a great cook and not someone who is afraid of any recipe with more than five ingrediants
i received this book when i first became a vegetarian as a young teenager i loved it then for its easy to make recipes and easy to find ingredients i love it now because the recipes actually taste better than my fancy veggie cookbooks i recommend this book for vegetarians \( and non vegetarians ! \) of all ages
the teen 's vegetarian cookbook is a wealth of recipes and tips for new vegetarians the recipes are split into chapters by meals breakfast , lunch and dinner and there are also chapters for soups , desserts and college cuisine the recipes can all be made vegan or vegetarian depending on the teens choice the recipes include new and different things letting teens explore thai and indian cuisine , but the cookbook also includes classic favorites like vegetarian egg salad and vegetarian blt 's interspersed throughout the recipes is information about vegetarianism and vegans and tips for teens , for example telling them to add ingredients to their parents shopping list and choose a saturday or sunday to make dinner for the family the book also stresses that teens should respect others lifestyle choices and understand that not all vegetarians have the same level of commitment
i chose to get this book because alot of vegetarian books make being vegetarian a complicated thing i'm not a teen but i just wanted to get to the point and this book does great reciepes ! !
this is not just a cookbook ! it is excellent for a teen , or anyone staring out as a vegetarian in a nonvegetarian society it gives great advice on foods , their prices and easy preparation tips there is also great incite included throughout from experienced vegetarian teens almost all of the recipes can be done very quickly and the ingredients are flavorful and common
i bought this for my teenage daughter after she borrowed it from the library time after time she is the only vegetarian in our home she loves this book it inspires her and helps her stay aware of balancing her diet
the teens vegetarian cookbook , arranged by judy krizmanic , includes commentaries from dozens of vegetarian and vegan teens on how they like to prepare their food and little tips like that applesauce tastes good with french toast , or what kinds of toppings taste good on a cheese less pizza there are even detailed instructions on how to cook spaghetti for neophytes of the kitchen ! i particularly like the section in the back on vegetarian survival in college as i will be heading off there myself in a couple years there are handy lists and charts too , like how to mix and match to make a variety of pasta salads or a sort of shopping list on the kinds of foods a vegetarian might want to stock their pantry with
everything in this cookbook is easy , practical , good , and creative it gives helpful tips , and a big variety of vegetarian recipes the recipes also appeal to my non vegetarian family this is definetly my favorite cookbook
i really enjoyed this one as i do most of patterson 's work
i greatly enjoyed this book it is not the best one written by james patterson but it was very good i would recommend it
it was an easy read and went quick i liked the big font and short chapters
i enjoy reading james patterson 's books , and this one was no different i highly recommend it
james comes through again a real page turner andrew gross picked a winner to collab with
i wont go over plot or characters because you can get that in other reviews , what i will say is this book is a great read i finished this one in about 5hrs , i did not want to put it down patterson has a great knack for characters and real dialogue between the characters nothing is too overtop or unreal in this story
palm beach lifeguard ned kelly has the perfect life then he meets seductive and very beautiful tess mcauliffe they go out and she 's the one as far as he 's concerned , however she 's tres classy and lives way above his lifestyle so he decides to throw in with four childhood friends , mickey , bobby , dee and barney , who have come up with a nice little score that will set them up for life
i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away , it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places , like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world
i really liked this book , it was a great fast read the only thing was the main character was very emotional , a little more than i'm used to in a male character , he seemed to cried a lot other than that i thoroughly enjoyed it
life guard satisfied my desire to be entertained as well as to stimulate my intellect this novel really does cover the gamut exhilarating action , stunning twists , genuine love , beautiful settings , ethical dilemmas , desire for riches , mysterious murders , detective investigations , false accusations , and self vindication yet somehow , it emerges as neither contrived nor unbelievable
contrary to popular opinion on this website , i found this book to be boring , repetitive and badly written it was so boring i struggled to finish it during a journey where i had little else to do this book summarizes a few events that were significant to intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled being an engineer , and not a manager , i found this to be vague and rambling however i do agree with the book 's title only the paranoid survive i think this outlook is useful for everyone , and not just business types
i picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it
this a good book based on facts andrew grove goes on describing how intel managed to shift from a semiconductor to the microprocessor company while he was the ceo \( now it is shifting again under paul otellini \)
intel was one of the pioneers of silicon valley , one of a handful of household brand name companies that helped to create , and constantly reshape , the information technology landscape in the us , and the rest of the high tech world andrew grove was at the center of this company from its inception , and this is his story in his own words
this book could have been one chapter , but i guess that 's hard to sell ! i have no idea why this has such a high rating it 's repetitive , internally inconsistent , and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving if you want a hopelessly out of date book about a ceo patting himself on the back , go for it bonus tons of boring anecdotes ! \( gotta fill up the pages somehow !
andy grove helped to build intel into the behemoth it has become on the other hand , he did n't sell ibm on the x86 which was the critical moment nor resolve all the manufacturing processes they had in different fabs \( craig b 's watch did that \)

a book which has been conceptualized well and organized well the author brought up some good experiences to justify his points the experiences are a well mix of good and bad it has been very well described on how one can steer clear even when there is enough obstruction particularly , the chapters where he described how intel has evolved to a microprocessor company from a memory company how the risc cisc confusion resolved are superb the author also nicely explained his inidividual take on how to intercept the right message from the noise

complacency is one of the biggest enemies of any organization , but especially for successful ones like intel only the paranoid survive provides two powerful observations that will help anyone who reads this book \( 1 \) that changes are lurking out there that need immediate attention inside your organization and \( 2 \) that you must be constantly vigilant for large discontinuous changes \( such as those driven by microprocessors , intel 's main product \) having the perspective of someone who has been both the beneficiary and the target of discontinuous change , dr grove 's lessons become all the more real at first , i thought this book was a little overdone but upon reflection , i feel that complacency is probably best overcome by paranoia in the absence of the management process to locate , anticipate , create and adapt to externally driven discontinuous changes i often cite this book in our writings about how to be more successful , because i believe it is an important work please read this book , and take its lessons seriously but have fun while you are being paranoid
one of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use , which is to say it all depends i note for example , in the introductory chaper , page 1 , overgeneralization , there are a couple major overgeneralizations that 's why they needed to invent math and science , where nothing is real except precise definitions , and logic works wonderfully using reason with actual real things takes more than logic
despite the typographical errors , i think this book is absolutely wonderful the author is informative and funny enough to make me smile and want to continue reading
bernard patten has done it again he has written another compelling book , truth , knowledge , or just plain bull how to tell the difference it is not only a pleasure to read , but an excellent manual for life 's daily challenges he has a sense of humor that is and always has been superb it is no wonder that his courses at rice university are always a sellout his advice is valuable and regularly usable , and one should place this paperback in one 's must read list in cinematic terms , i give it a two thumbs up
intellectually challenging content my thinking was engrossed and put to the test at its maximum limits
since eve took the first bite of the apple from the tree of knowledge truth in its purity has become a weapon through distortions and promises costing those seeking promised peace great expense and in some cases even the highest prices of all the lives of our loved ones
this book has to be a classic because everytime i reread it i get more out of it and i should know , i have reread it at least ten times not only is it right on target on how to improve your modes of thinking , it is fun and funny ! just the right thing for the up coming presidential election where separating fact from fiction seems to be the major issue
i have to say i agree with most of the other reviews kay hooper is one of a verrrry few authors i buy in hardback i was dissapionted in the book where were the agents with their psychic abilities it was hard to follow where riley was going the ending seems a bit thrown together i mean her and ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a hummer i like what she tried to do with the book but i think she fell short it seems to me kay hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all i sure hope the next book is better i think i will wait for it in paperback
kay hooper writes a series featuring different operatives in noah bishop 's special crimes unit what sets this unit apart from others is that the operatives all have some form of paranormal powers including bishop and his wife \( who were featured earlier in the series \) this story features former army officer , riley crane who is blessed with spidy powers unfortunately , she wakes up in bed , covered in blood with most of her short term memory missing along with her paranormal powers she had been helping on an occult case on tiny opal island the case takes a nasty turn with what seems like an occult related death riley warily navigates the waters with a spotty memory and evil stalking her
the newest release in the fear trilogy by hooper , with the psychic fbi special force `unofficially' investigating a series of supposed black magic satanist rituals , until the agent , riley cane , awakens covered in blood and no memory of how she got where she is for the past three weeks even more disturbing , she can use her psychic abilities something she 's never had happen before relying on her instincts she wades back in to the situation to find out what happened to her , and to the decapitated body found in the nearby woods in an apparent satanic ritual while riley does n't know who to trust , she treads carefully through the clues and crime scenes to find out what happened i was frustrated with unanswered questions , though , after i finished reading
great addition to the scu series new and old characters great story keeps you guessing until she is ready to reveal who done it
i did like this story the amnesia angle was written perfectly i enjoyed how the story played out very much i was learning things at the same time as riley and found it to be very interesting i thought that was fun and refreshing and hooper did a fantastic job with that aspect
i'm actually quite surprised over the negative comments sleeping with fear has garnered i , for one , love the bishop fbi scu stories , and thought this book was an excellent addition to the series
i'm a big fan of hooper 's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series however , a fbi agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what i was expecting from a kay hooper book it was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided , and i found the satan cult slant boring i think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books
this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is \( there is n't a single clue at any point in time \) the heroine keeps loosing her memory , so you do n't even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine \( since she ca n't even remember much about herself , much less him \) if you like kay go ahead and read it , but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard
in kay hooper 's latest novel of romantic suspense , sleeping with fear , the heroine is thirty two year old riley crane , an ex army officer and federal agent assigned to the special crimes unit she is an expert on the occult as well as a clairvoyant with psychic abilities that come in handy in her line of work as the novel opens , riley is vacationing in a beachfront cottage on opal island , south carolina one afternoon , she wakes up covered in dried blood , with no memory of the last three weeks of her life in addition , her psychic powers appear to be out of commission her boss , noah bishop , chief of the fbi special crimes unit , wants riley to return to quantico immediately however , she convinces bishop to allow her to stay on the island in order reconstruct her memory and figure out who messed with her mind and why
this concept has great truth and power in it if we could remember the basic concept we would make better choices and therefore our lives would be better we are what we think , no new idea , but we must be reminded dyer is one of the great teachers , no doubt

i read this a few years back when i thought i had reached the 'zenith' of spiritual development i do n't know why i felt this way , i guess i just thought i was 'pretty hot stuff' and i did n't think i needed to know anything else very naive on my part but this book blew open the doors to new levels of spiritual awareness it made me realize at an even deeper level that nothing in our lives is ever by accident everything has a meaning and a purpose and a reason no matter what it looks like is this always easy to put into practice \? of course not , but like everything that requires some degree of effort , it is well worth it
it is an excellent book my husband really enjoyed it and is starting all over again because it is so full of new ideas i am also reading it and find it exceedling worthwhile
wayne dyer shares a way of seeing life that is self empowering the way you experience life is indeed a reflection of the way you look at life it took me years to see the truth of this in my own life and although , i share this same message with others in my book , i praise the depth of wayne 's clarity and eloquence one path
i bought this book in 1990 i carried it around in my purse for over a year reading and re reading it it helped launch me in the career of my dreams whenever i felt afraid , i would read this book whenever i felt i would n't make it , i read this book i will give my daughter a copy when she graduates high school dr dyer shares personal experiences and practical examples to help guide you he has been ahead on the road of happy transformation and he shares insights that are rock solid if i was stranded on a desert island , i 'd take this book i have the audio cassette version as well , and am buying the cd version , too
this book is abound with breathtaking insights , i had a look at it and liked the title as i was beginning a study on prosperity , because in my life there was a lot of financial uncertainties and believed a lot of rubbish about succeding , from this book i learned to affirm myself and the world around me , as i realised that prosperity is not about who raised you , what your career and level is , but upon the level of faith and spiritual savvy which is easily obtainable if one only asked for it
dr wayne dyer has crafted yet another amazing book on personal transformation in 'you 'll see it when you believe it' he gives a detailed account of how to change not only the way you perceive reality , but reality itself he shows how to bring your reality to a higher and more enlightened level which will necessarily include manifesting good , being internally driven , heightening the power of coincidence and connection , getting in the flow of the universe , achieving a greater sense of serenity , being in the moment , and being free of negative and fruitless emotions it 's the sort of book that makes you want to highlight passages and ideas the text is filled with personal stories , examples and anecdotes to teach and inspire it 's ideal for those needing a little nudge \( or a big jolt \) in life and it 's ideal fuel for change
series of unfortunate events book 2 the reptile room
in the series of unfortunate events there are three regular children
i 've only read books 1 through 3 at this point 'point' being a word which here means 'until now , ' and by 'now' i of course mean 'then , ' at which point i wrote this review , but then i remember that anything written is suspended in present tense , so i suppose my point is moot
i like this book because the author has obvious connected with dragon they have been much maligned in historical fiction what with stories of captured maidens and stealing gold and so forth one might wonder why dragon , with no use for such things , would go to the bother of stealing them but of course , people tend to not wonder , do they \? those stories are entirely fictional and , of course , do not really represent dragon at all what are dragons , then \? they are highly spiritually evolved beings who chose not to continue to incarnate on this earth in order to help us and guide us from the spirit world they are some people who are lucky enough to be born especially dear to a dragon , and they have a lifelong dragon guide from birth for others it happens differently regardless , an actual dragon spirit is not common as they were earth beings and so , obviously , limited in number and whether we learn to connect with dragon energy or we become able to connect with an actual dragon spirit , dragon is a loving , fiercly protective energy and being and should always be treated with respect and honor d j conway understands that , and so i recommend this book it is a beginners' book , but there is always something for the advanced to learn in these books no one person knows it all
this book has several problems which keep me from recommending it to anyone it book presents most , if not all , dragons as wise and helpful to humans it is we humans \( especially christians \) who make dragons into evil monsters many of the facts about dragons presented are sugar coated , if not outright wrong i have to wonder how wise this is if you are planning to go summoning otherworldly entities in ritual for example , fafnir is supposeldey the ruler of dragons of the south , roughly analogous to the guardian of the watchtowers of the south there is also a description of fafnir 's mythology , which describes how fafnir is slain by the germanic hero sigurd fafnir , while dying , warns sigurd that sigurd 's treacherous friend regin is about to kill him however , any other book of germanic or european mythology will tell you a more complete version of the story fafnir and regin were human brothers , who killed their father for his hoard of treasure , among it the cursed ring andvarinaut fafnir then took all of the treasure for himself , changing himself into a dragon to protect his twice stolen hoard not exactly the sugar 'n' spice version of dragons presented in this book , and somthing to seriously consider before you invite him to be invoved with your rituals come to think of it , many of the dragons presented here are not many are simply large serpents or other mythical beings labelled as dragons the illustration of the goddess tiamat clearly has a , and is called in mesopotamian mythology books an imdugud , or lion eagle
just this last fall my guardian dragon was revealed to me through meditation , before i found this book this book has helped me to understand and connect with my guardian better it is the only one i have seen that deals with dragons as real beings , able to manifest in our world they want to , or when they are needed i am very grateful to d j conway for having the guts to write and publish this book it has been a revelation for me
an excellent introduction to the astral realm of dragons this book includes many powerful and effective rituals and spells magickal coresspondences are all accurate descriptions of various dragons are very descriptive and interesting \( mountains , desert , dark and light etc \) this book takes the practitioner and seeker by the hand and guides them step by step through the dragon realms the only thing this book lacked were creative visualizations i also did not like how conway required so many tools that were unattainable for rituals \( ie sword , staff , wand \) , although it may help to focus energy and create the 'mood' you do not really need all these tools , for dragon magick , they can be easily substituted in addition , just a reminder that you do not earn a dragon 's trust with fancy tools
take basic baby wicca add dragon images stir it all together like paint or a bad mocha end of book
terrible , absolutely terrible ! dancing with dragons is more like a dungeons dragons manuel with magickal references to the king arthur move excalibur all you need to do is add some cultural references , info on elements and various eclectic wicca rituals and voila you have a fluffy book with little substance and relation to occult studies or magical workings oh my goodness i think i will write a poofty wicca book ! i think i could absolutely do it ! seriously though students and seekers and those experienced in magickal systems , paganisim , wicca or what ever my advice is run away just run away unless of course you desire a good chuckle
i loved the book ! lots of information provided , historical , background , contact info , how to info , ceremonial info , benefits , dangers , and everything between
if i had the option to , i would permanently ban conway from ever writing another book she gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics , from basic wicca to ceremonial magick , to history and mythology , and the list goes on and on if this book were shelved under fiction , it would be better , but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot , with no historical references cited
there is certainly some good stuff in this book , but it was n't as good as i hoped
no surprise that orhan pamuk won the nobel prize my name is red is an amazing tale , told by multiple characters \( and inanimate illustrations as well \) , and deals with love , loss , envy , hatred , and the intracacies of art and its creators breathtaking prose is alive on every page due to the author 's magnificent imagination i intend to read more of pamuk 's work , and hope it has the same effect
the plot for this is quite similar to pamuk 's snow , though they are set in different times a man returns to turkey and visits a former teacher who asks him to create the text for an illuminated book being created in the western style to impress venice with the power of the ottoman sultan just before his return , a gilder who works on the project is killed , and soon after he returns , his former teacher is killed all this is different from snow the similarity is that he visits his former teacher in order to catch a glimpse of the teacher 's daughter , an old flame who he has heard has been widowed she says she will marry him if he can find out who the killer is and another , dangerous man wants her too so the love story is similar to snow 's how much you like this will depend on how much you prefer contemporary over historical fiction i felt this one was slowed down too much by long debates over the value of western vs islamic painting rather than creating suspense these delays left me yawning despite their tangential relevance to the recent danish cartoon controversy
i read the book in its original language and it was fun i was in the 16th century istanbul for about a week \( well , of course the author 's perception of 16th century istanbul \) , while reading this book i do n't recall what the details were , but it was interesting in the sense that objects like colors etc were telling the story in each chapter i had never seen that in a novel before
one of the best i have ever read also red his other book snow but this one is i think is one of the best reads i had highly recomended
this is not a review but a congratulory salutation to mr pamuk for being
a murder mystery set in 1500s istanbul , one of the most exotic cities in the world each chapter is a first person narrative from a different character , the very first from the man who has just been killed , catching your attention immediately the murderer has 2 voices , one his real identity not revealed as the culprit , and one as the killer dogs , trees , paintings and the devil all have a chapter or two as well making the story move along in a strong quick fascinating way , like going down a path of stepping stones towards the finish there is a love story , and a story of the forces of traditional islamic art facing the beginning of an invasion of western art ideals \( the angst and reactions of the characters is insight into some aspects of the depth and manner of the religion of islam \) this book is operating on many levels , all of them great a unusual style and a great multi level story , as if the dense intricate beautiful tile work of the ottomans became literature highest recommendations
i learned so much about islamic art from this book and the different techniques that are applied and valued in eastern versus western art learning about 16th century istanbul was fascinating and entertaining , especially because of esther , the clothier wonderful mystery romance and mini history lesson in one
my name is red is a huge and densely composed novel set in late 16th century istanbul among the small closed circle of miniature painters , who work their whole lives until \( and even after \) they go blind , illustrating books which may never been seen again by any other than their rich patrons though clearly a masterpiece \( there has been talk about pamuk as a potential nobelist \) , it is by no means an easy read
i started reading orhan pamuk 's my name is red in 2003 when a friend lent to me while abroad it was right after i had taken a course in islamic art so a lot of the information about the popularity of persian painting was fresh in my mind when i finally got around to reading the whole book it was several years later , the art history information was less fresh in my brain , but that did not diminish the perfect wonder that is in this book
i finished orhan pamuk 's my name is red just over an hour ago , and the pleasant euphoria of having finished a truly great book is just beginning to wear off in short read it
this book is a great , fun to read biography on diane france it would be a very good book to read if you are intrested in science it is very well written and it explains diane france 's life , her career , and what a forensic anthropologist is
as an adult , i have relished many well written biographies as a veteran middle school teacher , i have a bone to pick with the counteless boring , repetative children 's biographies my students and i have endured finally , a biography that is engaging , interesting , human and educational bone detective is a breath of fresh air in my classroom students love the photos that give the book a scrapbook feel sidebar photos and diagrams clearly explain complicated science concepts the writing style has grabed my 6th students' attention and held it suspenseful , humorous and thought provoking the forensics topic could n't be more timely diane france is presented as a real human , in a real science job in a way that my students are really relating to
this book is a must for anyone who loves dogs the book is a permanent reminder of beautiful animals that are put to death everyday across the us the pictures in this book will move you to tears the stories of these beautiful animals will tear at your heart well written but you can only wish the book was double it 's size because it leaves you wanting to see and read more
this is a great book with many wonderful pictures along with many happy and sad outcomes a must have for a dog lover
this book was really touching the photos are beautiful and most of the dogs you can just feel their soul and personality right through the pages
this is such a beautiful book about the sad state of 'disposal pets'
this is a beautiful book for both the animal lover or photographer , if you are both than this is a must have traer scott 's photos are amazing portraits of some of the unlucky dogs that make it into shelters each year some find new homes and some do not this book makes me proud to say i am a shelter dog owner and always will be
the photography in this book is beautiful ms scott captures the innate beauty and emotions of every dog she photographs just by looking at these dog faces , one can get a sense of the hardship , the longing , and the hope of these canines the stories behind each dog gives them such depth and character of course , these stories leave the reader viewer filled with emotions including sadness and joy , but most importantly , they provide a reminder of just how precious shelter dogs are and just how much they want and deserve to be loved
this is a collection of photographs of dogs from various shelters , each with a short description of their situation these dogs are the unlucky and unwanted , sometimes abondoned by their best friend , and some are picked up as strays the photos capture the character of these dogs , and some have such sad looks it is heartbreaking to read that some of these dogs in this book were euthanized , sometimes simply due to the lack of space in shelters in those cases , these photos are the only remaining evidence of their short existance recommended for anyone who loves dogs a percentage of proceeds from sales go to shelters
traer scott has done an extraordinary job the photos of these dogs are mesmerizing a must have for dog lovers , and especially those of us who have walked into a shelter and fallen in love with a furry stranger who then becomes our best friend on the ride home
for a long , long time , i was afraid that we would never hear from briar , sandry , daja , and tris again i thought we would , but the time lag between shatterglass and will of the empress deadened the expectation or so i thought
the four young mages are grown but their time apart seems to have created a rift between them each one has a secret they are unwilling to tell the others one fears letting the others see the true horrors of a fruitless war another fears being rejected out of jealousy for powers they do not all share the betrayal of a hero and his death torments one mages soul and finally , the last mage does not want to share the memory of a violent execution these secrets kept them from each others minds
i 've read alot of books , harry potter series , the hobbit , lotr , series of unfortunate events , flyte magik , his golden materials the list goes on i love the circle series , and the will of the empress is it 's best addition yet i ca n't wait for more additions to the circle reforged this book shows more of the characters personalities and how they are growing up how they thought they lost one another at childhood only to find a stonger bond i would recommend this book to anyone that likes magic , comedy , friendship and adventure
the will of the empress \( 2005 \) is the ninth volume in the circle series these novels relate the stories of four young ambient mages sandrilene fa toren , daja kisubo , trisana chandler and briar moss in the circle of magic quartet , these youngsters were rescued from distressing situations by the great mage niklaren goldeye , who recognized their talents and arranged for them to be trained at winding circle living together in discipline cottage , they learned to control and apply their inherent magics and developed very close relationships these mages were granted their medallions at the most unusual age of thirteen
i have read all of the circle books , actually all of tamora pierce 's books this is defintely a good one it is for an older audience which was excellent for me \( i started reading these books when i was 12 and am now 19 \) with this book you find out so many new things about the 4 of them you really get to know their personalities more and who they are as adults you now see them grow from children to young adults and all they have seen in their short life it is amusing how they can show up the most experienced mages in the world all because they work together , so this also is a good lesson for children , even though this book has more adult content in it than the other ones but if you have read the other 8 books in the series you will love this book the only frusterating part is how they wo n't let the other ones in their lives in the begining but of course everything works out all in all read this book , you will love it ! i only hope she writes more about the 4 mages
you can pretend that i wrote 4 1 2 stars
as others have indicated , this book features the reunion between the four young mages previously seen in the circle of magic and the circle opens books it deals with how the four friends have grown apart , and sandry 's required trip to visit her cousin , the empress of namorn
the late laurie colwin was masterful at creating stories about relationships never sentimental but always deeply moving , shine on is the story of a young widow and her brother in law you 'll never forget this story or olive and patrick a beautifully romantic story
i ordered my calendar and the company i recieved it from was prompt in
this is a great book for anyone interested in personal development i wish i would have read it long ago
this book is worth to read you will find plenty of interesting ideas and things u can use in u life , even if u are not manager and is not planning to be u can advance to some level by reviewing and using some clear techniques
in modern times perhaps no one has clarified the distinction between leadership \( an influence relationship \) and management \( an authority relationship \) better than the seminal work of the university of san diego 's joseph c rost with both fresh perspective and renewed vigor , though , daniel goleman and his colleagues have once again put a face on leadership as if it actually has something to do with human relations !
best selling author daniel goleman , who popularized a theory of emotional intelligence \( ei \) via his 1995 bestseller emotional intelligence why it can matter more than iq , has teamed up with colleague ei researchers , richard boyatzis and annie mckee to advance a new leadership concept primal leadership the authors focus on the four ei domains \( self awareness , self management , social awareness , and relationship management \) , and link them to leadership success that affected several organizations' bottom lines positively by bringing out the best in people , a concept called resonance it is revealed that ei domains or competencies create leadership styles that reinforce resonance as well as those that create dissonance drawing from a decade of the authors' collective research and the real life experience of leaders in the trenches , a connection is made where leadership demands more than conventionally recognized intelligence , but emotional intelligence as well the key to this is to use emotion to balance the reality of work and organization demands without unduly upsetting people to impact staff results in a twist , the authors find that the encouragement to use ei originates internally furthermore , they offer a learning plan as a mechanism to sustain transformation rather than a performance outcome model in the end , the book correlates its concepts to the organization as a whole to create the desired outcome of an organization with resonance that favorably influences the bottom line of the organization
the authors of this clearly written book draw on deep research and numerous studies of psychology and neurology to show that great leadership is primarily and essentially a matter of emotional intelligence notwithstanding the extensive support and the documentation from academic literature , daniel goleman , richard boyatzis and annie mckee have written an intelligent , lucid , easily accessible presentation they contend that , with practice , you can develop the critical leadership competencies of self awareness , self management and social relationship skills although the authors may understate the difficulty of developing these abilities , we find their arguments reasonable , persuasive and useful
this is a book about emotional intelligence which does not consider the reader 's emotions it 's very insipid and lacks the depth if you have already read the emotional intelligence by the same author , i would n't suggest this book
with the goal of helping people become more effective leaders , primal leadership authors goleman , boyatzis and mckee identify six styles of leadership , four domains of emotional intelligence , and five steps towards learning leadership skills
this book is much more useful than his first two books on ei it does a nice job of defining and describing the various leadership styles
in many ways this audio cd is better than the book it is based on goleman 's writing style can be stodgy , but his audio presentation is very good and it is great to hear the author emphasising the lessons that he thinks are important buy this if you use ei in business
this dolf de roos book is no different from his other books , owning one is the same as owning all writes about same topics and ideas good author , trying to sell more books by using different titles
making money in real estate , by dolf de roos diane kennedy
i first learned of dolf de roos a few years ago from reading one of his first books that was released through the rich dad , poor dad series i have read every one of his books and find his comments about real estate to be right on the money he shows you why real estate is the best place to invest and also how you can increase your profits by looking for unique situations very valid advice and a very good read i highly recommend this book
i purchased both this title and the insider 's guide to real estate investing loopholes \( same authors \)
i was a little disappointed in this book there is n't much new information that i did n't know already the information presented was n't in depth enough it 's good for people who are getting introduced to real estate
of all the real estate books that i have read or checked out and of all the real estate gurus that i have checked out , dolf is the best
i loved her first book , through a glass darkly , i read it at least four more times ! ! her sequel , now face to face , was closure to the first , but not as exciting or sad i cried every time i read the first one ! dark angels deals with the young alice , the grand old grandmother in through a glass darkly she 's just as feisy and clever in this prequel , but i still liked through a glass darkly the best out of the three if you want to read any of the books by this author , i suggest you start with that one
finally another book by in koen 's 17th century europe series , worth the wait i loved this preque
of late there seems to be quite a few books being released about charles ii of england and restoration england this i do n't mind at all , since i'm always on the look out for a good read , fiction or otherwise and author karleen koen certainly knows how to craft a good story , filled with plenty of details , dark deeds , and romance having written two previous novels , through a mirror darkly and now face to face , she takes one of the major characters from the previous works , and gives new depth and understandstanding to alice verney in dark angels
it has intrigue , suspense , love , betrayal , and twists on every hand , everything that makes a good book great starting with a princess coming home accompanied by her entourage , welcomed by a king and his entourage , and the welcome home party that soon ensued i absolutely could not put it down the only drawback was the lifestyle of some of the players and their unnatural affections toward others this played a minor role , however , and although it made me a bit squeamish to read , it was quickly passed over and the story progressed thus the less than perfect rating
although i loved through a glass darkly and now face to face , i was n't aware of dark angels until i happened upon it in an airport bookshop it is one of those rare books that is so engaging i was able to tune out all the miseries of flying and just read and in this case , reading was pure joy i loved the depth of the characters and details of the setting koen 's characters are flawed , but in ways that make them seem real this book is an example of how historical fiction should be done
i pre ordered this book , and could hardly stand the wait how much i had loved the first book by this author thru a glass and the 2nd was almost as good now face to ms koen has taken her story writing skills to a new and even better peak this is the best of the 3 now , i have to reread the other two since it has been so long i just hope she will not wait this long for a 4th book or , maybe , even do a book on something else do n't do a jean auel
this prequel to through a glass darkly does not disappoint if you like charles ii and the period of the restoration , you 'll love this book the character of alice verney is intelligent , charming , controlling , manipulative and sympathetic she is fiercely loyal to those she loves and unforgiving to many through her story the reader learns a great deal about the personal and political history of king charles the tragedy , the whimsy and the fascinating people that orbit his sphere great book highly recommended
i say it fell short only because when i got this book i hoped it would delve further into alice 's life , and beyond that , into diana 's life after reading tagd , which is one of my all time favorite novels , ms koen hinted strongly at an interesting history for alice and diana , and i just knew that a prequel had to come at some point years later , it is here , and while i loved the book , i was dissapointed in that it only spanned a couple of years \( if that \) and then ended abruptly at the most interesting time \( i wo n't divulge so that non readers wo n't be spoiled \) and not one hint of diana so i am wondering if there is such a thing as a second prequel \? \? ms koen simply must go further into alice 's life after this book ended and definitely introduce us to diana when she was younger ! ! i want more ! !
what a read ! like miss koen 's other historical novels , i could n't put dark angels down 'til i reached page 530 i was so totally immersed in the court life of charles ii and the story of alice , his portuguese queen catherine 's lady in waiting , i barely came up for air trying to speed read was impossible because every paragraph was filled with details and action that was not to be missed court life was so different from our lives today , the book makes for fascinating reading and not a little history in the passing , fictional or non but i might say that at the last , it 's as though the author got tired of writing her novel and decided to zip it up the story came to a sudden and predictable ending , leaving many questions of what happened to could this have been koen 's way of setting up for a sequel \? let 's hope so
congo by michael chrichton further shows what a great author chrichton really is the story is fast paced , scientifically accurate , and well researched the only drawback to this story is that it is not as close to home as some of his other stories \( excluding eaters of the dead \)
this was another great novel by michael crichton this book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members , then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language the gorilla will help them out in the end they will find some other stuff that they did n't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members
since i loved jurassic park and the andromeda strain \( way back in high school \) i happily picked up congo at the airport what an enormous disappointment the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half nonsensical details are never explained \( what 's with the gray gorillas and the paddles \? the gorillas were trained by the zing ites , back in the day , to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it \? this is never made clear \) , the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up , and the characters are ridiculously one dimensional this is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you 're sol the plot is not going to come together , and you 're not going to be satisfied that , plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology , left me entirely cold this book hit the airport trash can the minute i debarked
like jurassic park , this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters
diamonds have held man 's fascination from antiquity though its brilliance and hardness are widely known , its electrical properties are not michael crichton uses a quest for blue diamonds to unleash an action packed piece
this was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day this was also my first crichton , and i have to say i enjoyed it to the fullest easy to read adventure novel
this is the story of paul vincent galvin , who at the time of his death in 1959 was chairman of the board of motorola , inc and one of the most dynamic leaders on the american business scene the founders touch is also the exciting account af a vast business buit from scratch , and the story of a man whose life reflected the changing world of the twentieth century
i found it inspiring and at the same time intimidating to contemplate the brilliant , hardworking people who inhabit this book all of them committed their lives , talents , and fortunes to tackle seemingly endemic and chronic social problems , starting small and eventually spreading their good works throughout their nations and even globally i recommend the book for anyone trying to improve their communities' health and welfare
this account of one man 's efforts to revise the defintion of entrepreneur demonstrates the capacity of what can be achieved from small beginnings bill drayton has created a consulting firm that girdles the world creator and promoter of ashoka , a foundation dedicated to social change , drayton uses a highly selective arrangement to locate and encourage people desiring social change their efforts , rarely , if ever , depicted in either mainstream media or even specialty publications , are here explained and endorsed as is drayton 's unorthodox methods yet those methods , and the people adapting them to local conditions , have been demonstrably successful they need further study and application
this book has 15 or so case studies on how people , all ashoka fellows , made significant social impacts on their part of the world it also spends a significant numbers of pages describing the ashoka program itself it is kind of a cheerleader for ashoka which is less interesting than the case studies the case studies are very detailed and give uninformed readers like me an understanding of how other people have created successful social programs that benefitted their society if that is what you are looking for , i highly recommend this book
this book has a great title , but somewhat lackluster content the book is really not so much about changing the world , and more about one organization in particular in addition to focusing on an organization , i find that the stories of the people in the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they 've found who have made or are making a difference in the world it 's not necessarily bad there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you it just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often
david bornstein captures the spirit , determination and passion of social entrepreneurs from all around the globe
this book is an easy read great book with stories about people who are having a major impact in the world unfortunately we do n't read about them often enough in the newspaper and periodicals very inspiring enjoy
is there hope \? can we change the world \? is globalization a benefit to the world or a curse \? the western world look at globalization as a curse \( the loss of wealth and power status \) while the rest of the world looks at it as hope for life and quality of life social entrepreneurs have these and many other issues to contend with this a good book and highly recommended also , stop working by rohan hall which deals with globalization and entrepreneurship is an excellent companion book that also deals with these challenges
the how to in the title is deceptive this is n't yet another book that advises you to conserve electricity in your home , or to donate to charities , or to volunteer at local homeless shelters this is effectively a collection of short nonfiction stories telling about many personal accounts of social entrepreneurs the sort of people who devote their entire lives to actually go out there to make changes happen , who create organizations , not people who just support organizations these are stories about people who actually went out and helped construct solar panels to bring electricity to rural brazil , people who actually run a street youth safety hotline in india these are in a very different league from things like conserving water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth these are n't things that anybody can just do in their spare time a lot of the cases of social entrepreneurship described in this book are things i have n't even heard of before there are grayscale photos of the people and events there 's a lot of statistics both defeats and victories are described this seems to be a college textbook , not light reading at the back are extensive lists of reference websites
how to change the world is a fantastic book ! i founded projectchild net and this book has provided me so so so much insight and excitement david , has out done himself , thank you harry for gifting me this book ! i will gift this book to all my social entrepreneurial friends
this book is great ! there are some parts in the book that had me crying i was laughing so hard ! my dog even came over to see what was wrong with me ! \) so i definately recommend this book
another funny girly story from sophie kinsella the heroine is a work obsessed , intelligent , perfectionist , go getter career gal a female archetype that i could totally relate to \( smile ! \) she makes an \( apparently \) fatal mistake which sends her into a tailspin she lands herself in a bizarre and funny predicament i liked this book because it shows how we women can transform ourselves into whatever we set our minds to
the author of the shopaholic series features a workaholic in this hysterically funny book
fantastic , fantastic , fantastic i bought this book to read on a flight from the uk to australia and it had me laughing so loud i was quite an embarrassment ! i'm not a 'chick lit' kind of girl but this was a real exception as an author myself i really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh pure escapism , very charming and such good fun , and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life this should be compulsory reading for every workaholic and certainly every lawyer enjoy
i love every book that sophie kinsella has written her books are entertaining and engaging her character development in this book \( as well as all of her other books \) is excellent i feel like the main character is a good friend of mine becasue i know her so well i highly recommend this book
i never thought that i would read a book with a title like this but after i started reading it , i just could n't put it down ! i laughed out loud a lot when reading this i would recommed this book to any woman i know
samantha seems a lot like becky a young woman whose life is very out of balance and does n't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions instead of staying at the firm and working out her mistake , she runs away this is just like becky hiding her bills and then she gets a totally implausible job , because she ca n't tell the truth again like becky samantha does n't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to
i picked this off the new nonfiction shelf at the library to see what a writer might have to say about the stage of life i'm in too as others have said atlas remains , i think , too wrapped up in the expectations of his privileged class envying classmates who made more money , while living in manhattan , sending his kids to private schools and maintaining a home in vermont methinks he doth kvetch too much

having been a contemporary of atlas 's at harvard nearly 40 years ago , i was pulled back to that time when we spent hours in the womblike campus setting priviliged to fantasize about where we were headed in the blink of an eye , here we are , still trying to make sense of our lives but now dealing with all these losses of opportunities , loved ones , energy , dreams and illusions atlas hits all the big issues death of parents , loss of job , stiffening joints , anxieties about money and marriage and status amongst peers it 's poignant and provocative and , as atlas has himself done many times , i , too , teared up facing up to the reality that there 's likely a lot more living behind me than ahead all in all , a wonderful collection of thoughtful , poignant , sweet , and revealing musings on the beginning of the endgame from a guy who writes about the kind of stuff we 'd prefer to ignore , but know we need to reflect on
i enjoyed this book it is well written , literate in its allusions , sometimes amusing and always modest yet it disappoints because ultimately it is no more nourishing or exciting than comfort food for those of us who are mired in middle age and welcome any reassurance that on issues of money , sex , health , and personal loss we are little different from others in our feelings of insecurity and diminished expectations there is little drama or development in this book it also would have been improved had the author been willing to delve deeper , to be less coy and a little more concrete thus , by way of small example , atlas might have informed the reader that he went to college at harvard and not forced the reader to deduce it from his many references to cambridge and the 25th reunion report this might have begun to explain some of his initial delusions of grandeur and his subsequent disappointments
sharp , and witty while at the same time casting a warm and gentle gaze at the daily trials and tribulations of our baby boomer generation , james atlas captures the essence of what it means to reach that defining decade his chapters speak to those of us whose parents are aging and whose children have left the nest those of us who think of ourselves as successful until we face the reality of the new york real estate market as we attempt to downsize and divest ourselves of the suburban mini estates where we raised our children i laughed out loud , while calling out to my husband he 's talking about us
for any boomer who admits to being middle aged , james atlas' book is a must read atlas is an ace at capturing feelings , painting relevant flashbacks , describing current emotions and perspectives all of which makes this writer 's writer a pleasure to read but most of all , the book is a gem because of atlas' frankness and candor he lays bare his feelings and emotions which only serves to comfort those who have reached that point when , as bill clinton said on a recent birthday , there are more yesterdays than tomorrows
an insightful look into a life , with lots of universal truths to be had while some of the essays threatened to lapse into tedium from time to time , they were all ultimately rescued with honest insights into life especially poignant were the chapters on the death of the author 's father and on failure there was much in these essays that spoke to me i 'd recommend this book to a friend

one of the best books i 've read on iraq by someone with firsthand knowledge of the country , especially the kurds , and an excellent writing style galbraith worked for the u s government for 25 years and knows many of the players and issues well
i think that ritter has it about right about what is going on in iraq at the present time if i have a critisism about the contents of this book it would be thast the author seems to be biased in favor of the kurds
peter galbraith has written a compelling account of what went wrong in iraq i would have given him 5 stars but he defends chalabi too much and he is an advocate of the kurds i too admire the kurds but they also have their faults right now they speak with one voice but they have to prove that this will last
not only a complete history of the area and the country , but galbraith suggests the most rational way out for the u s and the peoples living in iraq
this book sets out the failed itelligence and the failed policy that have lead to end of the us moral leadership in the world hard hitting and full of stuff that i wish we knew at the time the decisions were made in future years this will be a resouce on how we were lead to do so many things that were wrong
peter galbraith offers his own professional diplomatic experience as insight into a way out of the quagmire of iraq he has been there , mainly in the kurdish region to the north , and has spoken with and dealt with kurd leaders the kurds suffered terribly under saddam hussein , but they also seem to have the vision of a cohesive way forward break iraq into separate federal regions , share the oil , and forget about a strong central government in baghdad not a solution much shared by the u s government , but then , the bush administration paid no attention to the different histories and cultures of the kurds , shiites , and sunnis \( not to mention other minorities \) of iraq before they invaded in march 2003 at this distance in time , in november 2006 , it 's pretty obvious that a unified iraq in the same mold as before the war is now out of the question it could be too late for anything but more chaos , but we should listen to the kurds , as galbraith suggests it could be the only way out for us , and for the iraqis
this is an outstanding book that gives the history and context to the iraq war by a person who has extensive experience in the region this book is easy to read and is a must read for every voter before nov 7
peter galbraith considers it is time to break up a country which he describes as 'destabilised by efforts to hold it together '
i gave this book 2 stars because the first 2 fifths of it were good the rest stunk

knowledge workers are those people whose main professional output is knowledge because all work requires some knowledge , the boundary can be arbitrary so , depending on where you draw the line , knowledge workers represent to 1 3 of the labor force in the developed world doctors , lawyers , researchers , consultants , and computer programmers all share this trait
i was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes if you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand , manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit i found it to be off topic for me as i was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who think for a living rather than their managers
this is a fine , occasionally frustrating book it is frustrating for the same reason that it is so badly needed business is just starting to figure out what it means to compete in a knowledge based economy knowledge work is tremendously important , but only partially understood this volume , which mixes practical advice with worksite studies , is a good stepping stone toward comprehending knowledge work and the people who accomplish it author thomas h davenport is honest enough to admit what is n't known , however he delivers what is known clearly he explains various organizational schema that are applicable , but not rigid he provides examples , sharing personal and organizational stories that illustrate both success and failure in knowledge work we warmly recommend this book to knowledge workers , those who manage knowledge workers and business leaders who are planning for the future
knowledge workers are innovators and often driving forces of a company 's product line and services they are it specialists and planners and you rely on them in your business but are they delivering as much as they can \? knowledge management expert thomas davenport argues many companies do n't maximize their productivity because they apply rigid management formulas to their workforce his thinking for a living how to get better performance and results from knowledge workers identifies four major categories of knowledge workers and provides a format for matching each category with management strategies which encourage optimum performance
in a sense , everyone must think for a living in response to questions , problems , opportunities , etc davenport focuses his attention on how to get better performance and results from knowledge workers and i presume to suggest that everyone involved in an organization 's operations should be or helped to become productive knowledge workers , whatever their specific duties and responsibilities may be those who have read any of davenport 's previous books notably working knowledge and information ecology co authored with laurence prusak , the attention economy co authored with john beck , what 's the big idea \? , mission critical already know that davenport is among the most perceptive and eloquent business thinkers on the subject of knowledge management in my opinion , thinking for a living is his most valuable contribution to that subject thus far
thomas h davenport holds the president 's chair in information technology and management at babson college he is director of research for babson executive education and an accenture fellow he is the author co author editor of ten books , including `working knowledge how organization manage what they know' \( 1997 \) this book was published in 2005 and consists of 9 chapters
i 've been thinking for my living for 30 years so i found it useful to get the perspective of a leading management consultant and thinker davenport has lived through business reengineering , been part of a large consulting organization and seen inside many corporations , so he knows the subject his book is written in a conversational style , so it 's easy to read its content is useful and it contains some valuable insights in particular , it builds on and fully acknowledges the work of peter drucker , who coined the term knowledge worker , as well as other thought leaders , which is refreshing , since so many authors do not acknowledge that they stand on the shoulders of giants and thereby deprive their readers of valuable context and background to their work
it 's a business book do n't have such high expectations mr davenport has put together a well edited survey of knowledge workers , technology based knowledge management and management of technology workers it is not terriby detailed and is not a boring academic text and it does not give you lots of program suggestions and checklists and most importantly you can come away from this with at least a few new notions of how to manage corporate and personal knowledge and perhaps a better based perspective of managing yourself and your subordinates
if you manage in a high intensity service industry and are looking for tips on how to evoke higher performance from your knowledge workers , keep searching for another book take 5 minutes and read the summary at the end of the chapters you 'll quickly see that there is little practical information or depth here
as an organizational learning consultant and author myself , i found this book , thinking for a living , to be very helpful thomas davenport has been a leader in the field of organizational learning \( ol \) for many years i think this is his best contribution to the field since his co authored book , working knowledge , in 1996
based on the advertisement at amazon this was the book in search of excellence it was not the book but an interview about the book i was very disapointed i still want the book on cd but feel it futal to try ordering it again on amazon as it is a nusance to order and return if you can help , i would love to purchase the actual book on cd thank you
tom peters is a gift to this generation he has taken subjects that have been blown out of proportion and brought them to manageable levels by doing this , he has created an environment where the common business person can provide and take advantage of exceptional products and services
in search of excellence is an interesting book to read which was an international bestseller when it was first published in 1982 the book was written for the general public in simple and easy to understand language and explores the art and science of management used by leading companies with records of long term profitability and continuing innovation however , the information presented was not based on hard data \( or based on faked data \) , which was its main weakness
a little bit on the dry side , but well worth it if you have the time i read this one a while back and had to flip through it again to refresh my memory and i'm glad i did consider this book to be the consumer reports jd power for companies back in the early 80 's it is still studied at some business schools
like many groundbreaking works , this one must be seen as important when it was written for what it said then , and important now for what it has led to inspired , without doubt , by the monumental drucker study of ibm , it took case analysis a step further its seminal ideas are found in many contemporary studies and schools or management thinking which have taken these principles yet further
it 's amazing how many people have read this classic peters and waterman book it 's even more amazing then how most companies have simply ignored the lessons illustrated within , only to continue on their dismal path of mediocrity the basic lesson to be learned is that if your company religiously follows the core tenets outlined in the book , then your company will be the leader in your industry , because you will be the only company to do so so why is this circa 1980 's book still relevant \? because the principles apply just as much today , and they apply equally well to business of any nature if you read this book , absorb all of the lessons , and practice them in your daily activities , then you will have learned the most important lesson in your business life
first at all , this book is not an additional well intentioned book in search of the promised land it is rather , a kind conversation between a friendly group , where tom peters one of the most respectable authorities in the management , makes an incisive analysis around a set of enrooted paradigms and fixed mental maps peters illuminates and allows himself to remark certain half truths we usually assume as holy word the managers are manacled by politicians who hinder them to display the take of decision process on the other hand there is an exacerbated and almost blind faith in what strict and apollonian planning , that somehow restricts the adequate flexibility in order to react to a competitive environment there is a hidden fear for bet in favor of the innovation and experimentation in this sense , this text was one the pioneers in what reengineering and systemic thinking would propose ten years after
this decades old book will probably go down as one of the most successful books ever the ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age
this is the second book i 've read on debt management each had different areas of focus scott 's here is debt portfolio management and the fundamentals of how loans work he wants you to develop good financial habits and know exactly what 's coming in and where it 's going out , and he wants you to understand how interest rates add up , so you can cut through all the offers and pick the deal that 's best for you consequently , there are worksheets to help you analyze your current position , and there 's a lot of drilling on real life examples of loans and what their true costs are he gives you tables in the back of the book that make analysis fairly easy , but if you can handle a spreadsheet program that 's a better way to go
the book itself is not bad , information is good , somewhat dated in parts , but good the problem is , nothing new is in the book all of the information can be found at one of several websites like quicken com , or bankrate com , etc most of the information is pretty common sense if you have to get the book or do n't want to look on the internet for the information , then at least go to the library and check it out and save your money

credit card and debt management is without a doubt the top of the line in its class after having read through several debt management books , this one assisted me the most in debt reduction and managing personal finances it 's clear , concise and practical , with real world examples to learn from as a member of the u s military who has had to relocate every few years , the use of credit cards has been essential in maintaining an enjoyable quality of life this book has greatly assisted in balancing it all investing in credit card and debt management is money well spent
this book is excellent ! it tells you the ins and outs of how credit cards work and how to use them to your advantage it explains how to use them wisely and dispells many of the myths that so many people still believe about credit it gives you in very simple terms the ability to compare different credit offers the easy to use tables in the back of the book help you figure out if an offer will help or hurt you in the long run and how long it will take to pay off accounts i also took the advice of getting a credit report so much on there from the past that did n't need to be there that was n't helping my rating

buying scott 's book can help anyone a wise choice and well thought out and written
written like a novel , this is the true story of charles ponzi , the most famous con man using the rob peter to pay paul scam i found the book to be entertaining without a dull spot after several unsuccessful cons , he started with a small stake and took people 's money and paid them 50 in 45 days when other people heard , the number of investors mushroomed he finally made about 8 , 000 , 000 \( in the 1920 's \) in this pyramid scheme before he was caught
\? ponzi \? chronicles the life of charles ponzi who is synonymous with the scam of paying off new investors with old investors money this entertaining character would promise a 50 return on investment in 90 days
like a great crime drama , ponzi takes you down the amazing road of a simple huckster , and how close he came to making it big i knocked it out in under 3 days it 's impossible to put down
to understand the ponzi scheme , is to understand the basic root of all types of cheating this book gives a wonderful overview of the life and times of charles ponzi it is written as a historical novel , but seems to be very well researched ! the epilogue alone is full of details concerning an important subject about whom little has been written i only wish the book was footnoted as to references donald dunn has done history a great service by documenting the life of mr ponzi this book is a fun read about a serious historical event
ciardi was a mind bogglingly brilliant man this comes across in this book when i want to learn about any subject , i start with the words and their etymologies i use this book as one of my references example albania why is it called that \? i find that 'alb' means 'white' , so it tells me that the country has snow covered mountains then , no wonder the white of the egg is called 'albumen' , the alps are called such , and the word 'album' means 'white tablet' , or an albino is an albino i guess an albatross must be white looking into word histories tells you about all sorts of things ciardi must have been working indefatigably on this subject , like pliny and some of those other guys who did so much work for all of us
i come across this book just by pure luck during my recent trip to singapore , someone suggested that i should read it
i first came across dr shahi 's interesting ideas on biobusiness when i heard him speak at a conference a few months ago his presentation created a bit of a buzz in subsequent discussions , several attendees strongly recommended this book
this is easily the best book on the life sciences and biotechnology that i have read in a long time
any controller will benefit from this well written , very comprehensive guide
flax for life has some great ordinary recipes for you to get into the habit of incorporating flax oil and flax seed into your daily diet it gives some good basic information about the benefits of flax oil , such as getting the essential fatty acids to maintain optimum health flax oil is one of the best oils to ingest daily , it also helps to lower cholesterol , help with heart disease and numerous other benefits , too many to mention here the recipes include such things as middle eastern bean dip , barlean butter , fresh fruit breakfast muesli , creamy garlic dressing and over 95 more recipes the book is a good price and is a gem in my opinion
carter is a master of framing and providing a context for complex issues like integrity this is not a preachy book with platitudes about the need for integrity it is about defining integrity , the situations where it will be tested , and ways to think about integrity as you make your own decisions in the end , it is a powerfully enabling book that i have referred to and recommended to friends and colleagues repeatedly for many years
carter 's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper sticker grade philosophy is just about on target his prescribed fixes , however , are little more than just the sort of swell sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering
it is about time that someone has had the courage to stand up and say what he believes about integrity in the world today stephen carter does a good job of posing questions that provoke thought upon a subject that is generally avoided because people like to fool themselves into thinking that they are living a life of integrity carter points out how often , in everyday situations , people show that they have not sat down and contemplated their actions before they do something that could make them look bad later he shows have many people shoot first and ask questions later rather than thinking about what is important enough to stand behind and what is n't a word of warning though , do n't read this book unless you are prepared to look at your own life of integrity
it was after reading the authors culture of disbelief that made me want to read integrity for weeks i had been searching for a book that would best sum up my belief that there are to many hypocrites people who say one thing but act the opposite i knew there was a word or theory that would best describe how i felt and then i saw this book and it was like a lightbulb going on integrity it is all about having the gutts to be the person you project yourself to be prof carter has this gift for opening your eyes and you find yourself going that 's right ! yes that 's true oh my god that 's right or simply yes ! then i got to page 31 and he mentions commitment then begins to describe how we as americans want reliability , and how we each admire the rare soul who has the integrity to do what is right while all the naysayers mock how we love it when someone keeps a promise he then discusses being forthright , steadfastness this is a must read in this election year a great book for reminding that ethical little person inside all of us that sometimes all it takes to renew anothers faith in humanity is for one man or woman to walk their talk
carter is gifted i am a cerified member of the vast right wing conspirasy and i love this book carter is not a leftist and he is not a right winger he is a gifted author who writes the truth and makes the reader think great book
while some might fault mr carter for missing some of the deeper philosophical ambiguities of the integrity and ethics questions , at the same time , he also misses a large segment of elitist abstract and obstruse arguments that make no impression on the normal people who are the american democracy mr carter does the nation a great service by stating the obvious \( which if it was really obvious , would n't need stating in book length \) in language that is sufficient but not difficult and using examples , that , while some might decry the close historical distance , are examples of things that are still close enough to be common knowledge , and thus , readily understandable without long explanation
prof carter has engaged upon one of the most ambitious , and socially important , projects of the decade writing a series of books outlining and explaining the essential elements of good character integrity is the first in the series , and it is an eye opening examination of what integrity is and why it matters this book should be required reading for everyone especially professionals , politicians and parents
i bought this book after i had purchased the magnificent book of kites this book has great big kites which are more complicated than the magnificent book of kites so , if you have experience building kites this is the book you need
listening to david sedaris is much better than reading him so much of his humor is in his voice , inflection and timing if you like his books this is worth picking up if you 've heard some of these monologues on the radio , it 's nice to be able to listen to them whenever you want
i thought this man was so funny , defently worth the money to get him just beware , people will think your crazy if you laugh alone
david sedaris is the only man i love to listen to that voice the perfect pacing the droll humor his stories are a compelling listen with a large drop of i need to see this man on a book tour thrown in the carnegie hall reading is another classic that even someone not familiar with him can fully enjoy the audience is not as distracting as you would think and he plays to them well without a lot of big pauses for all the applause i 've given this as a gift with not a complaint ! a good listen
if you 're a fan of his books , you 'll really enjoy this cd i still listen to it after owning it for a couple of years , and it still makes me laugh out loud his deadpan delivery makes the material even funnier than reading it i had the pleasure of seeing him in person in champaign , illinois , and i ca n't tell you how much i enjoyed it
i made the mistake of listening to this at 1 in the morning while my roommate was asleep by far the hardest thing i 've had to do in my life was keep from waking her up with my laughing sedaris' performance is simply hilarious i daresay , this might be even better than the boxed set his interaction with the audience is what makes this disc outstanding there 's a chemistry that is missing in the solo recordings
if you 've started a paperback version of one of david sedaris 's books without really getting into it i urge you to buy one of his audio books instead listening to david sedaris read his own works is an entirely different experience over the past three years i have accumulated all of his audio books and personally , live at carnegie hall is the best bang for your buck hearing him read his stories live and being able to hear the audience 's reaction really make you feel like you 're right there , in the room , with him also , his inflections are better when he is playing off the audience ! the best reason to buy the live at carnegie hall cd , however , is because it contains some of his absolute best stories including six to eight black men , repeat after me , who 's the chef and hejira the only thing missing is rooster at the hitching post from dress your family in corduroy and denim \( a live version of rooster at the hitching post is on the aforementioned cd dress your family in corduroy and denim is also a worthy purchase i teach a writing workshop and i ca n't tell you how many of his stories i have used to help students improve their writing david sedaris would undoubtedly find that ironic if you 've read me talk pretty one day you know why \) finally , let me offer this last selling point if you are looking for an audio cd to listen to on your commute to and from work you ca n't go wrong with this or any of his other audio books his stories generally range from ten to thirty minutes and , no matter how bad your day was , you can always trust that david sedaris has experienced something worse i find him to be the perfect travel companion do buy his cds now today
i am a huge fan of david sedaris' writings when i saw he had an audio cd , i was more curious than anything to buy it the comedic timing of sedaris is something you do n't get just by reading to hear the stories as the author intended them for you to read them is insight to the stories on another level i also enjoyed the q a section of the disc , even though it is brief all of the tracks can be found in his books , so there is nothing really new on the cd for the devoted fans still , funny as anything and a great thing to listen to in the car
if you are familar with sedaris and are looking for something new this is n't it though i 've read most of his books i 've never have heard him on public radio , probably because they do n't appeal to my political bent that being said , the only thing about the cd is you get to hear him read the short stories aloud there is n't much insight into sedaris himself i find that once i read something i rarely read it again and the same goes for hearing something after i 've read it very funny the first time not nearly as funny or entertaining the second time add to that his nasal annoying voice and , well , you get my drift
i 've read all of david sedaris' books and plays i think he 's simply the best comic writer working today unfortunately , i have n't had the opportunity very often to hear his readings , making me very pleased when sedaris released this audio collection in 2003 recorded at carnegie hall in october 2002 , he 's in fine form
sure , this cd is laugh out loud hilarious , as is many of his books but how many authors can actually read their stories out loud in front of a rapt and eager audience at carnegie hall \? not many , i think
as a stand alone story \( not a prequel \) , this book is relatively fun if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos i ca n't believe this made it past editing !
this is a jam packed , full of adventure , page turning , funny , mysterious , story of how peter pan came to be i found myself reading this book over a weekend because i could not put it down i was anxious to see which adventures would take place throughout the chapters ! ! i'm not normally a fantasy reader but with this years yrca \( young reader choice award \) i'm beginning to take a liking for this type of writing
i really wanted to like this book i bought it to read with my 9 year old because she and i are so interested in pirate stories i am also a fan of dave barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and i
this really cool prequel answers once and for all the burning questions you have been harboring about the man child who lives in neverland with other little boys no , no not that one , i'm talking about peter pan , the fairy loving , pirate hating leader of the lost boys \( same thing , you say but that 's a different story altogether \)
this book is okay it never really immerses you in the world instead you just sort of skim along the top of it , half caring about what happens next everyone feels like a stock characters the bad guys are bumbling idiots , and the good guys \( even peter \) are self sacrificing and far seeing we barely even see the task force which calls itself the starcatchers , and the book really could have survived without them tinkerbell does n't show up till the last page or so \( i spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast \) , and the croc never eats the clock
this is an excellent book that is so well written you ca n't put it down my 7 year old daughter , who has loved the story of peter pan since she was little , was completely enthralled chosing to read over any other activity just to find out what happens next each chapter leaves you hanging just enough that you ca n't wait to read on and on and on ! the descriptions are great , too i teach writing to third graders and there are excellent descriptive paragraphs that i would love to share with them to show them just how descriptive and creative you can be ! i highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a wonderful adventure the fact that it 's a story about peter pan and the founding of never land is almost secondary to the action
i read this to my 8 and 6 year old at bed time it was so enjoyable for all of us that we could n't wait to get back to it each night the story does such a great job of explaining how peter became who he is the kids were both crying last night when we finished it appropriately sad that peter , having to remain a boy forever , would miss out on the same life his aging friends would have i thought it was great that they both got the emotion of the goodbyes
this book is great for people who are n't gourmet chefs or for people who want to learn how to switch over to a healthier lifestyle and eat more vegetarian food the recipies are very easy to follow however , if you are used to a high salt , high fat diet you will find the food bland you 'll need to adjust the seasoning and decrease it over time to acheive the full health benefits this cookbook gives great ideas on some surprising vegetarian meals it also tells you the nutritional content of each recipe
wow ! this was exactly what i was looking for i read eat to live by joel fuhrman and was looking for a true vegen cookbook with recipes that you could like
if you 're on joel fuhrman 's eat to live plan then this cookbook is indispensable recipes are free of processes foods , oil , salt , and there are many wheat free options
what a great book ! 420 pages , hardback , and every single page is worth reading , not one page is boring you just want to keep reading and keep turning pages !
i 've read quite a few of nora roberts 's books and this was the only one on which i had the complete 'wowzer' reaction i mean , seriously wow this is a book full of content , with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks , reading and rereading it to get it all ms roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the olympic rain forest the characters are likable , and believable , and most certainly not your average roberts book livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as noah could be a persistent annoyance and readers will find themselves grieving for julie macbride along with jamie , rob , val , david and livvy herself and there 's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling
when i started reading river 's end , it reminded me of a remake of the o j simpson murder it is a story centered on a little 4 year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father years pass by and the story unravels olivia 's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy written in the ingenious nora roberts style i have grown to truly enjoy , this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the olympic rain forest through olivia 's eyes i guessed the villain about 1 2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as i could never be 100 sure i was correct i would highly recommend this book to everyone
in river's end , nora roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years a story of hollywood 's glamour gone astray , and the young girl who survived it but this is n't a typical plot by any means , not with roberts' doing the writing she guarantees many unexpected events along the way !
some may not consider this one of her best , indeed , it is n't listed as a fav anywhere , but it had enough nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything i could there after
my first nora roberts' book with only be persistent did i complete the book found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
i could n't put this book down it was so good it was such a surprise because by reading the inside cover it does n't sound at all good but i gave it a try and i'm glad i did it 's definatly become one of my favorites this year the story comes alive for you
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger , them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning , and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it , but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of ms roberts

i am a docent and at times a docent trainer , and this guide came in very handy when i was preparing for an exhibition on contemporary artists it is well written , to the point , and has extensive coverage for a little book
i'm a bfa student at virginia tech heading to grad school and this is an excellent book to teach from , have as a reference , or just thumb through for fun simple and succinct while still thorough it 's really an invaluable thing to have for ready info at your fingertips this book has been part of the curriculum here for performance art , found object sculpture , and installation classes , and everyone in the class universally approves and finds it helpful
perfect for writing critiques and analyses from all art movements great glossary of terms for a beginning art student looking up hard to understand words in text books
a glossary of art terms this book is a definite must for those writing analyses of art it 's also good for looking up those tricky terms in your text books it is filled with artsy terms and illustrations i used it in all my art history classes
people of all groups , ethnicities , religions , and races commit cons , steal , and such to paint a whole ethnic group , gypsies \( romani folk \) with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites oven tenders because of the holocaust or call all corporate officers embezzlers because of enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so these sorry characterizations merely illustrate how twisted the slanderer 's own views are
i must say i am appalled at the negative feedback on this book , and can only deduce that these reviews are written by those of whom this book speaks ! granted not all people of any ethnic race or population are bad , dennis is simply exposing a behind the scenes multi billion dollar business that just so happens to be run by the gypsy culture the stories in here are true and not fabrications i have had the pleasure of meeting mr marlock and listening to him speak he is a very knowledgeable individual who has certainly done his homework and knows exactly what he is talking about i highly doubt mr marlock is making millions on this , it seems to be his passion , his life 's work to get the word out there so less innocent people fall victim to such cruel crimes the honest people work hard for their money legitimately , and no one should be allowed to just take it away to all the scam artists out there , spend less time writing bad reviews and go get an education and a real job !
the disparaging reveiws about this book , to me , can mean only one thing there are people out there who do n't want the truth to be told is there such a thing as the gypsy mafia \? yes are they costing all of us by perpetuating their very lucrative scams \? yes
well , if you ca n't blame anyone else , blame the gypsies dennis marlock is doing very well probably , using gypsies as his career enhancer however , replace gypsies with jews , hispanics , blacks , asians , and you would have a libel lawsuit on your hands dennis , keep talking about gypsies , and you true racism continues to show through
i manage an insurance investigation department though this book did not cover the many insurance fraud schemes , it was very accurate in describing the culture of this group of fraud artists invaluable reading for a fraud investigator
this book was excellent more informative and suspenseful than the others , and it will keep you reading for hours it was well worth the late night to go pick it up ca n't wait till book 7 !
harry potter and his friends return for their 6th year studies at hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardery harry , ron , and herimoine are tested as they endure their most difficult year of hogwarts in addition to learning new spells , practicing quidditch , and experiencing teenage life , harry must take time out of his day to look into dumbledore 's peinseve to learn about his arch enemy , voldermort friendships are put on the line , and trust is tested at the end of the year , hogwarts is put in an extremely difficult situation , leaving readers eager to read the 7th installment j k rowling 's the half blooded prince continues to deliver the all of the magic that readers first fell in love with
i throughly enjoyed harry potter and the half blood prince i thought it was a little short compared to book 5 , but the story was very well developed the only problem i had is that i will have to wait for j k rowling to finish book 7
this was a great purchase and highly recommended for those of us who have a long commute and no time to read a book
j k rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way
it may come as a shock , but i always suspected that something 's not quite right with snape well , we 'll see what happens next
in this next to last volume of the epic series , professor dumbledore shares hidden secrets with harry about his foremost adversary voldemort harry makes an unusual discovery in potions class that serves him well , but even so , another great friend is lost also , a surprising someone now stands with the dark lord if you are a harry potter fan , you 've got to read this book to find out why he who cannot be named is such a menacing evil force you will never guess the ending of this volume and where it will take you next
i loved this book but i hated a lot of the stuff that happened warning very sad and frustrating stuff happens but i guess they were things that needed to happen to help push him to do what he is destined to do
coming in with four stars , harry potter and the half blood prince holds its own among the finest books in the world harry potter and the half blood prince , by j k rowling is the sixth book in the harry potter series , and arguably the preeminent one i'm not a real aficionado of books , so a rating of four stars means this is a practically flawless book the only downside is that the book is very extensive , and if you 're an impatient reader this book is not for you but there are more positive aspects to this book than negative ones i say this because harry potter is not your typical witch and wizard novel the book throws in a sense of reality among all the sorcery and spell casting you can sense the reality in the emotions of the characters , the way friendships play out , and how holidays are celebrated but it still captures the ways of the upcoming wizard harry potter by bringing to the book new spells , allies , and enemies and there 's always the spine tingling fear of lord voldemort waiting on every page
i was recommeded this book by a fitness coach i was about 50 lbs overweight and suffering health problems anyhow , i been following the program for about 2 months now and occasionally work out and have lost 25 lbs i tried atkins before and did lose about 40 lbs , but as soon as i went off and added carbs back i gained weight like no tomorow i wore everything i ate with this program i eat a lot of fruit and vegtables and the part that is great is it seems to kill your hunger after awhile i used to think about food most of the time and with this program , i actually sometimes have to remind myself to eat that is completely un heard of for me prior additionally , i feel much better , my compexion , and skin is much healthier looking i ve lost about 25 lbs already and i have energy to want to work out with atkins i had no energy and no endurance occasionaly when i cheat , and eat bread , it actually upsets my stomach now i used to have indigestion frequently , now that is also gone i highly recommend this program
this diet elimninates starches and grains , sugar , of course , legumes and dairy products and makes the case for us eating like our ancestors good examples and receipies may be hard to follow completely in its purest form
this version of the protein diet brings the whole eating craze back to the center where it belongs it just does n't make sense to eat dripping bacon and greasy cheeseburgers without any checks and balances the paleo diet calls for a sensible approach to eating lean protein as did our distant ancestors , and reinstitutes the idea that fruit and vegetables should be a mainstay i do wish there was a more prominent place for whole grains , but who says you have to follow paleo exactly \?
the paleo diet by loren cordain , ph d is a monumental work that brilliantly explains and popularizes what may well be one of the biggest breakthroughs in scientific understanding in human history the evolutionary hypothesis of human nutrition and lifestyle this hypothesis does what no other diet and exercise regime does it builds a scientific model that can be used to make predictions that can be tested and it does so upon the very foundation of biology evolution
every nutritionist , md , chef and charliton has a diet theory low fat is good low carbs is good balanced \( whatever that means ! \) is good loren cordain also has a theory his theory makes as good or better sense than most of the others our body and mind are probably better off if we eat the foods we evolved with over a couple of million years of evolution what makes cordain 's approach different is that he backs it up with real science , that is , testing his theory with real research and real tests on real subjects using the scientific method if the tests do n't show that the one or another part of the theory is working it gets cut out and the theory modified i'm tired of trying out untested theories which are politically correct or sound good i want science cordain delivers
as always bradygames provides a stellar guide , but this one is a cut above most other strategy guides it includes an in depth look at the characters and the history of the xenosaga trilogy i recommend this guide to any xenosaga fan or newcomer i personally only use the walk through on as needed basis , but having the guide is great for discovering every secret this game has to offer
maps , enemy data , secrets , boss strategies everything you could want in a walkthrough , and more they even did their best to keep it spoiler free
this strategy guide did a credible job of helping me locate important items without spoiling the plot without this book , i would have missed out on most of the sidequests and optional battles you can only access some of these extra features of the game during a specific point in the story
there are 240 pages in this walkthrough but the walkthrough does n't actually start until page 120 with a picture
geoffrey moore 's latest book should be required reading for all executives in the age of the internet rather than filling out a theoretically weak book with numerous examples , or building a detailed theory which cannot be applied , moore has produced a brilliant work of practical business theory drawing on and extending his work in crossing the chasm , inside the tornado , and the gorilla game , moore looks at various stages in the development of businesses , how to manage for shareholder value , how to create and sustain competitive advantage , and how companies with diverse cultures can effectively overcome the innovator 's dilemma any executive feeling threatened by the internet , or wishing to take full advantage of discontinuous innovations , should read this book

most people thinks about war , like some very bad , but every day we are involved in situations that require taking consciousness about facts that happens around us , to really know the true to create a very real perspective , in order to take actions in a directed way to be successful
i got a top tier mba , spent tens of thousands of dollars and two years , but did n't learn the important stuff \( and i was the valedictorian , and got some really great jobs \) i really enjoyed greene 's book 42 laws of power \( i ca n't remember if it 's 42 or some other number \) , but this book is a great reminder and educator of the way things work behind the scenes , in people 's minds , and at the macro level of every business and political dealing i'm convinced that there is either a conspiracy in our educational system to make us dumb workerbees , 99 of our teachers just do n't get it , or our measurement system for the quality and effectiveness of our eductional system is severely broken \( or all the above ! \)
most people see war as a seperate activity unrelated to other realms of human life but in fact war is a form of power carl von clausewitz called it politics by other means and all forms of power share the same essential structures
having been a previous owner of 48 laws of power and the art of seduction i was awaiting this foray into the art of warfare and i have not been disappointed ! after receiving this book as a birthday gift , i have not put it down in the last 10 days managing it a piece at a time , and adding some highlighting to key phrases
among the other reviews here , there have been some comparisons between this book and the art of war by sun tzu i 'd agree both are elegant and detailed instruction manuals on how to prepare yourself for conflict
definitely and highly recommended for students of war and leadership !
i learned a lot of new things by reading this book ! for example , in
as a writer , success coach , consultant , and combat veteran and ex political prisoner , who works with combat veterans adapting to life in the world , especially the entrepreneurial world , i'm always on the look out for great books that cover in detail the subjects i'm most interested
this book is a masterpiece filled with principles that will impact your daily life finally , a motivational book that has more meat than fluff !
i have read the 48 laws of power by the author this book is even better it is fascinating and practical the book is gripping and laced with strategy and tactical wiles to emerge as winners in the modern game of combat and existence must read

the term innovation has been used so much in recent years that it 's become cliche humans have been innovative for over 30 , 000 years , before the day of the first fire pit people have always utilized innovation but now it 's is more vocally emphasized in the business realm because of ultra competitive global market forces , and because we 've reached the stage where technology enables change at a more rapid pace innovation is a mantra for lack of better words , creativity , adaptability , and innovation have always been vital they 've always been used by the successful the winners the victors innovation has always been mandatory survival both literally and figuratively
we recommend this book to everyone involved in innovation whether you 're involved as a creative thinker , a promoter of new products , a manager guiding the innovation process or an investor evaluating an innovative company , there 's gold here for you authors tony davila , marc j epstein and robert shelton compress a mass of research and experience in innovation practices into a set of rules and guiding principles then , they use stories , lucid explanations , charts and careful definitions to illustrate how these principles work a few of these concepts could have been expanded profitably for example , how to tell in practice when radical innovation is needed , how to determine if you 're innovating too much or too fast , and how to sort out the best ideas without discouraging the creators of the rejected concepts that 's the only caveat everything else is fascinating and immediately applicable
many executives decide they want more innovation from their organizations but are n't quite sure how to encourage that result relax you can read and apply making innovation work , and you 'll do a lot better
it is a good book that clearly shows models to map the different types of innovation and the problems involved to manage it
there is a dire need for a fresh look at innovation
wharton school publishing offers another indispensable source for business leaders and policy makers facing the increasing challenge to sustain performance and growth innovation is necessary for sustained success , and , as an integral part of the business , has to be managed this book is the accumulation of years of experience and research by the authors in the field of improving innovation in order to realize greater value and growth for the company

this book challenges the prevalent misconceptions about innovation , and lays out the tools and processes necessary for an organization to harness and execute innovation \( from the introduction \)
this book opens with some cheery news much that is held as common wisdom regarding how successful innovation is managed is wrong according to the authors , innovation does not require a company wide revolution or mystifying transformations , nor a focus on technology or a devotion to building a creative culture in fact , not every company really needs a large quantity of innovation instead , there are a few requirements to implement a successful innovation program specific tools , rules , and discipline the right measurements and incentives and the ability to integrate both business model innovation and technology innovation

with all the new , revised , and up to date versions of the bible avaiable i was happy to find an edition still around that all christians can relate to i have 4 different editions of the bible and the newer editions leave something to be desired the only problem i have with it is that the type is small
i have read the bible through at least a half dozen times and parts of it many more i prefer the kjv because it is more poetic and other versions are really no clearer in meaning
this is an excellent edition to have in one 's library it helps in dealing with some of the translation debates when some kjos tell you that the kjv is the only perfect translation of god 's word you can ask them which edition of the kjv they are referring to if i had a dime for every time i 've heard a kjo pastor or lay person hold their bible up and say , i have the 1611 , god 's word , and only the 1611 is god 's word i would have a pretty bank account so few know that the bible they hold aloft is actually a mild revision completed in 1769 most of them have never laid eyes on an original 1611 and if they did i'm sure they would be shocked to their socks that they could barely read the somewhat challenging 17th century king 's english you can show them this facsimile bible so they can see a picture of the real thing
i really like this bible in fact , it is probably my favourite version of the few copies in my personal library it is an exact fascimile of the 1611 bible with proper typeface , spellings , etc while reading it , one can easily imagine him herself in 1611
i am a serious conservative bible student of many years i have used a variety of tools to ferret out what g d has to say to us in his holy book this is another that most students should have , not to address the content of the pages \( because it is unreliable by comparison \) , but for the ongoing kjv only argument that still remains
inevitably , the king james version of the bible will draw fire for its archaic language i do not believe that this is a fair basis on which to critique a particular printing of the king james bible
i think the 1611 holy bible king james version is a must to complete your bible collection complete with the apocrypha , the 1611 edition will give you in your hands an exquisite replica of the original kjv one thing about the kjv , it really , along with the writings of shakesphear , solidified the english language
i just received my copy of the 1611 edition of the kjv bible as one of the other reviewers had said , upon opening and beginning to read i could sense being in the presence of holiness also , the cover really is n't so bad it 's dignified and simple
i was up at nights reading this it really is a great book
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia is this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note at the end of the book we read sep 10 , 1990 nov 10 , 1993 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted
i thought this was a good book one of the many that keeps you turning the page due to suspense ralph roberts had no clue that his insomnia would lead him to heroism and he would finally get to sleep stephen king 's one of a kind creativity definitely comes to play here i would recommend this book to anyone i think anyone would enjoy the suprise ending in finding out about the promise
i 'd read most of king 's stuff during the uh decade of my ute salem 's lot and pet cemetery being the hook on the line and the stand , shining , christine and it reeling me in
once again in king 's books just like the green mile we have the senior citizen ralph roberts who is recently widowed and he starts suffering from insomnia then he starts seeing crazy little guys and people with balloons attached to their heads ! i would start seeing things too if i went without sleep for a few nights i was hoping that a clown named pennywise with a stack of balloons would appear since this book is set in derry maine but no such luck i think somebody should buy king an atlas because he seems to be unaware of any other locations except maine which does get rather tiresome after awhile there are a couple of subplots about a wife beater and abortion in this book but i find it to be a very good subsitute for seconal i give this book 5 stars because it seems king is still trying to live up to the promising writer that he once was 20 years ago
origionally i had checked this book out from the library , but it was so good i bought a copy for myself the character development is very good , and the story \( though it has a few ho hum spots \) is interesting and flows really nicely however , this is not a scary book at all but really a rainy afternoon read
no kidding this book gave me insomnia ! i would wake up at the same time every morning , just like the character in the book it was awful i ca n't remember how long it took me to get a full night 's sleep after reading this book buy and read at your own peril
there is nothing wrong with this book it 's not too long it 's not hard to read it 's perfect i read this book in elementary school and i have n't read a book sense that i think is better this is my all time favorite
okay , first let me confess that i'm not the typical steve king fan \( is there such a thing \? \) i read the stand years ago , and have loved the dark tower series , which has led me to start reading some the peripheral tower books like insomnia
the charlie bone series is an entertaining one , and all the kids i know who read it want to keep reading more that 's my goal as a teacher , so i try not to quibble with the gigantic plot holes that exist in the world nimmo has created nor do i care that the main character seems to have no personality he merely serves as a plot anchor
the problems at bloor academy intensify for young charlie bone in this second adventure poor henry yewbeam , actually charlie 's great granduncle , goes missing from the year 1916 and turns up in the present charlie discovers his distant relative and the powerful time twister that allowed him to make his incredible journey unfortunately , it does n't take long before manfred bloor , his father , and grandfather pick up the trail things get very complicated as charlie keeps losing henry while trying to figure out the riddle of the time twister
charlie bone is one of many of the children of the red king his 'gift' is the ability to see a photograph and 'hear' the events that pertain to the time in which the photo was taken the yewbean 's are ancestors of charlie and relatives to the red king as well when the book opens , we read about henry yewbean , who is tricked and sent into the future with a marble sized ball called the 'time twister' when there , he meets charlie bone , a descendant of his from the henry 's future the story is about charlie helping henry escape from bloor 's academy , which is an academy for gifted students , run by henry 's cousin , ezekiel , where charlie is a student and henry is stuck there because of ezekiel 's plot to kill him after many mistakes and misadventures , charlie and cook , along with several of charlie 's friends and his uncle , paton , help henry escape and return to his little brother , who is now in his 90s , because he is unable to return to his own time , for reasons explained in the book with lots of twists and turns , this book definitely will keep the reader turning pages great for children , teens , and even adults all in all , a pretty good story
the book is about charlie bone and in this one a kid comes about from 100 years ago adn has to fit in , in that time
do you like harry potter \? then the series of charlie bone are for you !
if you are into adventures and time travel you will like this book a lot because of time travel and adventure in january 1916 , it 's the coldest day of the year when henry yewbeam puts on his blue school cape and takes his bag of marbles down to the freezing hall halfway through the game , henry sees a marble rolling toward him he picks it up it is full of beautiful colors suddenly the walls start fading , the light is going he feels himself disappearing henry writes on the floor , give the marbles to james then henry vanishes from the year 1916
this is one of the best biographies i have ever read you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work it 's a true labor of love filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes , this one is a keeper who knew miss francis was such a wild child \? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff , lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase
this is a very detailed book about the life of kay francis the authors present a chronology of kay francis' life based on her diaries and other extensive research kear rossman provide intimate details of her life in an unbiased and thoughtful manner the authors were able to convey their love of kay thru the book we receive a glimpse into the life of a hollywood actress in the 20s 30s this book will appeal to people interested in kay francis and hollywood i enjoyed it because it shows the individuality of kay francis her charity work , midwestern values , sexual encounters , and career are all presented in the book the pictures were great and interesting
i must admit , i did n't know a lot about kay francis going into this book but i had seen her in a couple of films and i went the extra mile to delve deeper into her life and career i was glad i did ! oh , what a life ! oh , what a career !
this year movie buffs are extremely fortunate because out on the market is not one but two wonderful new biographies of the actress who could n't wait to be forgotten kay francis lynn kear and john rossman have done a superb job of detailing kay 's life with an especially rich section about her early life prior to hollywood stardom the book also captures the essence of the jazz age of the 1920 's when women were coming out of their shells and becoming less uninhibited in many ways kay francis was the epitomization of the free spirited women of the jazz age the book , as usual for a mcfarland product , is lovely to look at and the picture quality is superb both books quote from kay 's diaries which were long forgotten at a university archives the diaries provide much of the dynamic revelations in the narrative kay 's candid thoughts about her life and \( many \) lovers kay francis certainly did , as the title says , have a passionate life and a career which movie buffs and fans can easily appreciate we are fortunate to have this wonderful book as a reminder of that life and career
kear and rossman have made a major contribution to our understanding of this glamorous and intriguing star with great skill , they meet the reader 's expectation of being told a captivating story , while staying true to the demands of scholarship the book is extremely well researched , and as thoroughly documented as any scholarly user could want , but never dull or plodding supplementing the text is a generous selection of striking photos
this book is a treasure of intimate details and provides a unique perspective on the 1920 's , 30 's and 40 's this is not a stereotypical romantic view of that time , but a gritty investigation of the life of kay francis and the hollywood elite it is well written with numerous authentic photographs and references to the private journals of kay and her decadent world it is an honest and revealing portrait of an individual and how the other half lived i highly recommend this book for history and movie buffs both
this lavishly illustrated biography is a great read it includes great nuggets of research , including previously unknown information about kay 's parents , her bisexual relationships , and behind the scenes tidbits about her film roles the diary entries are particularly revealing wonderful
what a wonderful bio on a fascinating and complicated woman sadly overlooked for decades exceptionally well written and painstakingly researched , this book not only tells a full and textured account of all aspects of kay francis' life and work but also deftly weaves in historical content of the heady times and locales she occupied a must read for kay fans and anyone interested in the golden age of films this juicy and revealing book is a biographical treasure and one of those rare instances of exciting , original information in an exceedingly well done package best thing i 've read in a long time
this is a tedious , by the numbers biography that reads like an appointment diary the authors have done their research , but a biography should be more than a who dined where on such and such a date most of this was gained from kay 's journals little insight is given to who kay francis was as a person , which is crucial to a biography the book concentrates and inordinate amount of time on kay 's love life and the list of her lovers gets quite tedious after awhile the book is less than 200 pages long and is a paperback the pictures are nice , but one expects more from a book for this price most of her films are judged by film reviewer quotes giving the impression the authors couldnt be bothered to view the films themselves this is definitely the lesser of the 2 recent kay francis biographies i dont really understand the rave reviews for this book , as it is one of the most disappointing hollywood biographies i 've read in quite awhile
kay francis fans and classic movie buffs should rejoice as lynn kear and john rossman have written the perfect companion book to scott o'brien 's excellent biography , i ca n't wait to be forgotten while o'brien 's book expertly focuses on kay francis' film and theater career , kay francis a passionate life and career delves deeply into kay 's private life
the days were so long till i got back to the book loved it
terrific writing and story line you wont be able to stop thinking about it all day long till you finish it ! excellent twists through out the whole thing too the story just keeps getting deeper and more twisted i'm looking forward to reading the rest of tess' books
the surgeon is still the best book tess gerritsen has written , but this novel is probably second in my opinion i loved this book for the first time i liked the character maura isles i could actually understand the issues maura had to be dealing with also , jane rizzoli , who i believe is getting stale as a character , was kept out of the forefront enough for me to enjoy the plot the plot was great i did not get the feeling of overwhelming evil from the villain , but then a villain does not have to be unredeemably evil to be a villain also , the secondary murder \( actually the one that puts everything in motion \) was resolved in a way that i sure did not see coming this was a great read , fast paced and intense this is why i count tess gerritsen as one of my favorite writers concluding god , that dwayne was a creep ! ! !
this book was awsome i read the others in the series , so i devoured this one in just one day i love these books , and i think this was my favorite
how would you like to have to perform your own autopsy \? that is the conundrum that faces dr maura isles in body double when she returns from a conference in france to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house the investigation into the murder leads maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before , and also leads maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women
dr maura isles is very surprised that there are a couple of obstacles that are linked to her throughout the book some of the different events and some of the different adversities through the book were strikingly familiar to her ownself she has been on edge ever since some problems through the book if you would like an exciting , and would like a book that establishes many different adventures for maura isles , this is the book for oyu to read
now , i have been reading quite a bit of tess 's books and i must say i found this one an absolute enjoyment
i blasted her when she wrote the apprentice and hated the jane rizzoli character in body double however , i found the twosome of maura and jane a good match this was a quick read , lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending that i thought was rather quirky and fun
this is oe of my favorite suspense authors i wish she would write faster i really have enjoyed all of her books they are well written and interesting , exciting stories definitely recommended
the first review i posted was that of 'the great gatsby' , and now this
in the us , we understand sexy but we struggle with the erotic we read the body like we read the newspaper , by habit with a glance our real failure in love is our failure to take our time it 's not in our nature to wait , to sample , to savor we rush into love as if we were late to an appointment gabriel garcia marquez in his memories of my melancholy whores does n't rush the book is a seduction and moves at that quiet lazy confident pace the protagonist turns 90 and , mindful of his mortality , wants what he 's never had a night of wild love with an adolescent virgin of course , desire is a dream and dreams are an attempt to remember and , what do we want to remember , everything , everyone we 've ever loved memory , though , is an admission of loss desire is our straegy to reclaim what was lost of course , memory is a trickster and that 's part of the joy of this book , as the professor , defies death less through contact with flesh , than though memory and desire in this book as in life , it is the approach , it is anticipation , that sets us on fire
some will think that memories of my melancholy whores is about 90 year old man seeking sex with a 14 year old girl , but , it so much more it is garc a m rquez 's refreshing primer on aging
this is a swift , sweet read the urgency of the narration moves ahead almost breathlessly the 90 year old narrator has begun to count minute by minute the minutes of the nights i had left before i died , and repeatedly announces his intentions with the phrase today 's the day as if there might be no others left
i will just echo the other assessments of garcia marquez 's latest book beautiful , beautiful , beautiful wonderfully rendered passages and that almost spiritual quality of his writing relay the story of a man looking back at the loves and conquests of his life with real depth and humanity
the title of my review basically tells exactly how i feel about this work the writing \( and the translation \) is simply beautiful , and it 's of such a length that it will take about 2 hours of your time to read these 2 hours will not be wasted , i assure you , for you will read words written by a modern master of literature the plot is quite simple , and often not even necessary , for the language and the writing carries this book from beginning to end i only wish that the book were longer so that i could spend more time with a very delightful elderly man
this thin volume can be read in one evening it goes very fast , not only because the book is not thick , but because it flows after a long time gabriel garcia marquez wrote finally a novel , and although it is not comparable to his past epic , complicated accomplishments , it is remarkable
nobel prize winner gabriel garcia marquez returns to the literary scene with another great novel a story about a man who decides to sleep with an adolescent virgin for his ninetieth birthday a journalist by trade , his other preoccupation is women
the quality was good and it came in a timely manner i was pleased
this book was a gift and that is the only reason i am not returning it the story is bizarre , which in and of itself is not bad but this is bad luckily my daughter found it as painful as i did to read zero appeal on any level if you want great bizarre try heedly pecked me in the eye !
olive and her cast of friends prove to be very imaginative in their quest of returning a lost heart my daughter loves this book and it has become a regular nighttime read for us
olive , the canine heroine , has found a one of a kind object she just knows must be returned a heart ! and not just any heart , it 's a huge heart one that is as loving as olive 's is now , with the help of her friends , handler the squirrel , flea the flea , and weaver the spider , olive must find a way to return the heart to it 's rightful owner her very good friend dexter the dog
i have a six year old son who loves this book , especially the pictures there are a few pages that have extravagant landscape scenes with tons of stuff going on and we play a where 's waldo type of game to find all the different types of fruits and veggies and also find the different snack posse team members he absolutely loves it
i am glad that my best friend happened to mention how much her daughter loved the race against junk food we were talking about books for our kids having read kr 's review \( above \) previously , i had second thoughts about buying this book for my son
i ca n't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars i was completely disappointed the book included very little useful information to help kids make good nutritional choices fruits and veggies are awesome was about the extent of it the text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud , and the illustrations are not appealing i am returning this book
excellent , the race against junk food is a wonderful way to teach kids , parents and grandparents \( like me \) about healthy eating habits my 5 year old grand girl loves this book it 's colorful characters and great story keep her interested from start to finish she even tells other people about the book , and wants all her friends and family to order a copy right away i highly recommend this book and encourage everyone to read this colorful guide toward good nutrition
i have a 2 year old and a 5 year old and it has been a bedtime favorite for a couple of months the story is fun and the characters are cool and colorful since the characters are fruits and vegetables , the book furnishes you with a fun way to talk about healthy eating
how many ways are there to get our children to read , eat healthy , and be more active \? answer none , until i found race against junk food the story is wonderful , action packed but non violent , and it gently moves a child 's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle what could be better \? read it with your child and see if you do n't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables \( and leave that couch amp cheeseburger behind \)
very helpful easy to read some is i knew that already but that is coupled with interesting ways to handle things
this book is uses very simple psychology methods to understand people and their responses you can use these tools in everyday incidents to get what you want the chapters are concise and to the point with real life everyday examples to find the truth and advantage to every situation i highly recommed this book to people who want to gain tips and experience with an upper hand
this book is so outdated all the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980 's and earlier , which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past there are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
i agree , the book has many , many good insights and most of it makes sense you can theoretically use his techniques , but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real life situations also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth , more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited i would not buy this again it 's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee it seriously lacks depth but it 's a decent read but you will forget everything you read in 2 days
i have read several books on verbal self defense and this is by far the best it contains techniques that are simple and easy to remember most of these methods are in the form of a statement that you can make the only thing you have to remember is that although these tactics look and read very good on paper , real life situations are a different story , in that , when you employ these techniques , people might not react the way you anticipate them to in the short term but , i am confident that if you employ these tricks on a regular basis , you will see some positive long term results
concise , easy to read and remember , well supported , and extremely effective ! recommended for anyone who want to improve their interpersonal skills people will not like you more when you do sth for them , but when they do sth for you
the power of influence is evident and this book allows you to visualize it from the author 's perspective alot of the powers of influence is tattooed in our natural responses , dont look for the second coming in this author , but view him as a light house in a sea of battling waters and that will be the only way you will be able to truly appreciate his writing style
david explains how the laws of human behaviour operate for the advantage of those few who truly understand their impact on human behaviour i threw logic out the window as i became increasingly aware of the raw power of emotion to guide and direct our lives i now have a feeling of being behind the wheel instead of being the passenger
this book is excellent and teaches various psychological methods to influence people it makes a lot of references to nlp and cognitive psychology very helpful in the real world well written by a knowledgeable professional
this book is very good for those who need a little edge its evaluation of human nature is very accurate many of the suggestions are worth trying this book is very oreinted towards costomers a money maker , so to speak but the psycological factors are very acurate and well described the author uses proven psychological tactics to manipulate and control any situation it is a very good book to try and have fun with
since i am agnostic , i held some trepidation at reading this book , worried about excessive religious overtones this is n't about religion it 's about living and coping with our inner demons the protagonist is a preacher from a long line of preachers telling his family 's story and his own to his son whom he knows he will not live long enough to see grow up it is a compassionate and intimate tale of this character 's inner life and ruminations , yearnings to be noble , and his baser human inclinations it is beautifully told what a wonderful read to find insight into the human portrait
for a novel which is essentially without a plot to hold one 's attention and build a growing admiration for the author 's skill is no mean achievement that is what this book did for me
an outstanding characterization of an elderly clergyman close to death
i enjoyed this novel , but the pace is slow and the story line does not compell you to read keeping reading , so i ut it down for days at a time
the pulitzer prize winning gilead is an extremely personal book an aging congregationalist minister tells his story through his diary entries meant to be read by his 7 year old son in about 15 years \( long after his ill father 's death \) the historical background harks back to the days of john brown , the radical abolitionist preacher the current day is rural iowa \( gilead of the title \) in the `50s i struggled with some of the theological discussion \( although congregationalists are cousins to unitarians \) , but rev ames story of personal discovery kept me going there is a great story about a town in kansas that you 'll long remember
i loved this book a friend of mine , an english teacher , gave it to me to read because he enjoyed it so much he told me it was the journal of a dying man written to his young son , and i thought , i know i'm not going to like it i thought it was going to be depressing it was n't it was sweet and wise and lovingly written i thoroughly enjoyed reading about his prayer times , his relationship with his wife , his love of his town , and his thoughts on death and aging there is a little bit of a plot just enough and a little mystery , which is nice but if you love good writing , this is a gift you 'll be purring as you read it
this book is a meditation on faith and what it means to be a moral person it 's pace is slow , yes , but the insights are profound and the language precise and elegant john ames struggles with his faith in an almost physical way throughout the novel it 's a noble struggle and real for in the end , only hard won faith , doubted , contradicted , second guessed , and tested , is worth anything
i was surprised some at how much i enjoyed this book because it is an epistolary novel consisting of only one , long letter from a 77 year old minister to his seven year old son , i thought it would be boring it was certainly different from any contemporary books i 've read , but it was n't boring at all
in this amazingly beautiful work of fiction , robinson manages to capture the beauty , pathos , and miracles of everyday life i walked away with two primary impressions first , how absolutely breathtaking is the voice of rev john ames for one squaring off against his own mortality , he has an amazingly refreshing outlook on life secondly , it has been a long while since i 've seen quite a colorful character as ames' grandfather a kleptomaniac , one eyed , vision led prophet that fought against slavery with a bible in one hand and a pistol in the other it is not a stretch to say that this book had echoes of faulkner , steinbeck , with as compelling a narrator as to kill a mockingbird
if you 're thinking of reading this book , let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy \( really \) , and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners , but this book , in perfectly plain english , sucked there is no plot , no beginning , middle or end , and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help , but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
h g wells may be best known for the time machine and the war of the worlds , but do n't overlook the island of dr moreau this short novel , 160 pages , is n't so much a fast read as it is a good one the titular dr moreau is the quintessential mad scientist whose life 's work involves vivisection he takes animals and through surgery and brain manipulation attempts to give them humanity the result is a twisted menagerie of beasts who share both human and animal traits his experimentation has allowed them to understand human speech , and his brainwashing makes them believe he is a god whose laws must be obeyed
i read all of h g wells' most famous works , the time machine , the war of the worlds , invisible man , and the island of dr moreau in a row of these , i would say that moreau is the worst
this is a haunting book about the effects of science and human attempts to alter nature as with most horror stories , the narrator survives which everything around him crumbles , but the meat of this novel is riveting there is great action , the main characters are interesting \( though not fully developed \) and the story moves quickly without a lot of pause the message of this book becomes more pertinent every day and while the science underlying dr moreau 's experiment is iffy at best , that does not detract at all from the effect of the novel i would recommend this book to all science , science fiction , or horror fans
the lone survivor of an oceanliner is thrown into a series of events beyond his control he finds himself saved by a resident of a strange island and has no other choice but to live on the island until another ship sails near , unfortunatly ships do n't come by often upon his arrival he discovers that dr moreau , an unorthodox scientist , is conducting experiments on live animals , experiments which change them into pseudo humans upon this horrible discovery prendick is thrown into a fight for his life against the beasts of the island and dr moreau
this is one of the great classic sci fi novels , utilizing the great formula of imagining a horrific implication of some of the science of the day , and then using that as a springboard to comment on humanity
this book was very quick to read , and was a lot of fun normally i am pensive when i'm looking at reading 19th or early 20th century authors , but this is just a great book the book presents difficult questions about animal testing , genetic testing , and other questions of ethics facing today 's scientists and citizens for sci fi fans this is a must read
this is one of the few books that i 've ever read to my husband that he could n't figure out before the end tim powers and his billion threaded plots defy attempts to predict their outcome definitely and enjoyable read powers knows how to weave a very tight plot that still leaves room for humor and whimsey highly recommended
to date \( may soon be overturned as i'm trying a new one from tim powers now \) this is the best book tim powers has written i have tried some of his other stuff and it has been like he is a one hit wonder the anubis gates is a very good read that he has not matched again in my view here 's hoping that my current trial of another of his books comes close to this one
this book is easily one of the 10 best books i 've ever read it turned me on to the works of writer tim powers , and i have now read every one of his novels \( and most of his short stories , as well \) the anubis gates is easily one of his masterpieces it is usually lumped under sf or fantasy in bookstores , because they honestly do n't know what to make of it it is both sf and fantasy , but so much more for lovers of dark , modern fantasy or anyone who loves a great time travel tale unlike any other this book is highly recommended i also recommend powers' last call but it is not for the faint of heart
if you think it would be impossible to meld egyptian gods , time travel , poetry , and historical fiction , think again , because this book does it
i was recommended this book by a co worker who knew i liked the works of umberto eco though less erudite , powers does spin a great tale by reworking actual historical facts and filling in the gaps with far out fiction somehow he makes it work if i tried to tell anyone the plot of this book , i would get the most absurd looks imaginable
what sets tim powers above many others who write in the fantasy genre is his excellent grasp of both history and mythology , and the effortless way that he blends them together to create uniquely fascinating story lines the anubis gates is a fine example of his genius he combines history of early 19th century and late 17th century london with egyptian mythology , binds it all together with time travel , and creates a fascinating and fast moving story he skillfully introduces historical personages such as lord byron and samuel taylor coleridge into his story , as well as asides referring to king george iii and his madness , and napoleon and his threatened invasion of england he also creates an intriguing london underworld of bizarre beggar 's guilds and gypsy tribes he then shows us this world through the eyes of a 20th century academic that is thrust into it almost by accident
tim powers is a marvellous author this time his imagination takes you on a time travelling trip true , it has been done before just not like this tim powers makes it real the research he has done for this novel probably even has some historians starting to believe in the possibility
norman podhoretz was a new york intellectual in the 1950 's 60 's , once editor of commentary magazine a left leaning writer then , in the early 70 's he began leaning right and became one of the founding fathers of neoconservatism he was an anti communist who rebelled against the anti american bent of the 60 's radicals \( the thought of jane fonda all decked out in her love beads sitting down with the north vietnamese leadership to trash all things american still gives neocons the heebie jeebies \)
norman podhoretz is one of the most important american intellectuals of the post war period his shift away from the left toward a conservative position helped mark a new period in american intellectual life in this memoir he writes about the ' friends' of a former time , each of whom is a distinguished 'name' by themselves allen ginsberg , hannah arendt , the trillings , lionel and diana , lillian hellman and norman mailer podhoretz blends the personal anecodote with the ideological quarrel in explaining his estrangement from these friends at one point he talks about how their radical indulgence in their own appetites led to a kind of moral chaos which he understood as destructive and damaging
podhoretz , the man who recently said what 's the big deal about a few thousand dead g i 's in iraq considering what 's at stake \( without having a clue that nothing is at stake \) , norman disparages the artist intellectual egotists of the 60 's 70 's that do n't fall in line with his ideology while today he lauds the conservative egomaniacs that have brought our country to its low level of intellectualism and turned a nation founded by intellectual deists into a disneyworld of mcreligion but it 's all fine so long as we make the world safe for democracy norman seems to think there is something hypocritical about professing social justice and being a small time celebrity , when in fact , as freud said , the partial motivation of any artist is fame and the love of women \( speaking i assume of male artists \) einstein enjoyed the limelight everyone enjoys the limelight and everyone has his or her weaknesses have you ever read einstein 's poetry \? yuk ! so to disparage the ones you do n't happen to like is a bit disingenuous the true irony is that only an attention seeking egotist would write a book about such trivial nonsense but this is all in keeping with a man who explains what writers should be writing if they only knew better , ex , he applauded james baldwin 's early career because he was on his way to being another henry james he condemns him when baldwin 's attention turned to racism in america imagine that a black writer distraught over racism in america the very idea ! i think norm 's whole problem can be traced back to his youth , which he relates in his autobiography making it , talking about taking the subway from culturally challenged brooklyn to manhattan , growing up as a nice jewish boy , the son of modest working class parents , attending college , and rising among the ranks of the intellectual new york crowd nowadays , norm is comparing the invasion of iraq to the invasion of normandy , and explains that iraq will become democratic by using as an analogy post ww ii germany 's quick transition to a modern democracy \( of course , with the help of 2 1 2 million allied troops occupying it \) how did this guy ever have friends to begin with \? \?
this highly readable book is going to be despised on the far left for exposing some of the key intellectual icons godparents of the movement as insidious buffoons a useful and brief companion book written years ago for some context would be tom wolfe 's radical chic mau mauing the flakcatchers
podhoretz is just a thug ! he justifies the comment of a viennese anti semite one hundred years ago , hermann bialohlawek scholarship is what one jews steals from another
i ca n't believe the negative reviews i 've just found regarding this title and some of them written by so called feminists themselves how can someone be offended by a book or the stories of others' lives \? only if they choose to fear words or the expression of others' thoughts and ways of life
this is an outstanding collection of essays i could easily relate to many of the postives and negatives of relationship commitments that all of the women discussed i found this book a breath of fresh air
as an avid reader , a feminist , and newly engaged to be married , i was thrilled to see that the third wave feminist grrls from bust magazine had edited a book on marriage to add to my excitement it was published by the very cool seal press , and had a forward by my hero bell hooks it was severely disappointing ! based on my previous experience , i expected honest , daring , endearing funny stories from a variety of self actualized women instead i got boring stories about how un feminist marriage is , what last name the baby gets , and is lesbian marriage real marriage clearly the editors did n't do a very good job seeking out qualified submissions something with attitude , something where theory meets praxis to top it off even the forward from bell hooks was bland she discusses her legacy with feminism and leaves out discussing marriage ! a \( good \) book about feminism and marriage is despretly needed it 's such a difficult area for all of us partnered thinking humans sex and the city is doing great why ca n't we have a book version and i do n't think the rules counts
it 's amazing to see the explosion in books offering veganism as the solution to the world 's ills
the author writes with zeal about the new medicine vegan diet full of references and detail , this is a solid discussion of how chronic disease can be prevented \( and managed reveresed \) with diet as a vegan for over 3 years and a registered nurse , i thought i knew it all , but this book proved me wrong your average physician is going to do one thing , wait until you have disease and then prescribe medication or surgery to manage it you can do better take matters into your own hands and read this book ! highly recommended
this book , the vegan diet as chronic disease prevention , reinforces common sense attitudes toward the relationship between the quality of the diet and the resulting effect on health this is the only book on the subject of health and diet that i have found that is simple enough for anyone to understand and yet sophisticated enough to cause most doctors and other health care providers to re evaluate their practice of medicating the symptom and ignoring the root cause anyone doing research will love all of the credited sources and references , there is no opinion in this book , it is all proven with cited sources and studies
i received the vegan diet as chronic disease prevention a few days ago for my birthday and have not been able to put it down since i know , that sounds like something one would say about a good novel , not a diet book , but this is n't your typical diet book it outlines all the different diseases that are caused by diet , and provides a roadmap for reversing or stopping the damage as i read the vegan diet , i ca n't help but think about the friends and family that i have that could be helped by following the advise given within from the coworker with a daughter diagnosed with a d d \( this same coworker blurted out the other day that cheetos must be healthy because they have cheese on them \) , to my dangerously overweight cousin , everyone knows someone that could be helped by this book i know what many of my friends will be getting for christmas this year , a copy of this book
this book is the most complete resource that i have found concerning the effects of food on the body and the resulting problems that a bad diet can cause anyone with a child that has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder \( add \) needs to read this book before drugging up their son or daughter
this book is the finest disease prevention book that 's come out in a very long time my question is why is n't this on the shelves of every bookstore and why is n't it being promoted by the natural health food stores \? is the publisher not promoting this as it should be \? it is a great resource for everyone , as disease prevention and as a diet , as well as historical information it is a shame , in my opinion , that more people will not have the opportunity to read and learn from it merely because it is not being promoted as it deserves to be whoever has dropped the ball on this one , get with it ! ! !
this book is a very easy read , even though it is packed with more references to research than i have ever seen in a book of this type before now more than ever i believe we are what we eat
this book is really good it goes into depth , really , about all matters concerning a healthy lifestyle , really i really recommend it
as some other reviewer pointed out , unfortunately dawkins with this book is preaching for the choir but hopefully it will give the more sane portion of the population some ammunition to meet the dogmatic rantings of the deists his writing is sharp , witty , and cuttingly sarcastic , and an easy read , even if you do n't agree to all his points
dawkins does not attack anyone , but notes that carl sagan and many other recent scientists made a grave error in attempting to reconcile religious beliefs with scientific facts when religion held the upper hand , the resolution was to force people like galileo to renounce their works science has held the upper hand , but too many scientists are on government payrolls or dependent upon grants to conduct meaningful research , and they must bow to forces imposing political correctness at universities to maintain their tenure or other sinecures
i decry supernaturalism in all its forms , writes richard dawkins in the god delusion i am attacking god , all gods , anything and everything supernatural , wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented \( p 36 \)
dawkins did a great job of presenting the current scientific position of atheism the book can guide the debates between believers and nonbelievers it is nice to hear dawkins say that his mind is open if god 's existence is proven his book is thus timely because my scientific proof of god 's existence did arrive at internet book stores this summer \( search on the first scientific proof of god \) a am waiting for reviews of this proof a scientific proof of god 's existence was possible earlier because the `scientific method' was found during the renaissance however , at that time , science and theology were becoming two distinct fields of thought
just read this book and decide richard dawkins sheds some light on some very complex ideas reading the god delusion is more enlightening and lucid than reading the prose in the holy bible especially the king james version with its difficult to understand 1611 english the updated translations \( niv , nrsv , esv , etc \) of the bible are easier to read but still have bizzare stories and lots of verses that contradict one another christian friends of mine have explained these logical contradictions in the bible unfortunately , their explanations of the contradictions are vastly more confusing than the logical contradictions themselves \( at least to me , anyway \)
critics of richard dawkins' new book the god delusion ultimately characterize his work as both angry and vitriolic , or more tamely , polemic these are unhelpful descriptions as each fails to ask the question whether dawkins has something to be angry , vitriolic or polemic about too many cultural commentators want to engender what they claim to be a thought process , but is in all actuality a feeling , that we should find a middle road between the mandates of science and the insights of spirituality the bargain such people strike to make has value , but only where we can manage to clearly differentiate between those areas of life which science can and has spoken to , and those where it has not
this is a mildly entertaining and informative read the book has been extremely controversial , mainly due to the title and the semi divine status bestowed upon richard dawkins by the atheistic community what is most interesting about the contents of this book \( amply described in other reviews \) , is that dawkins himself has almost nothing original to add to the science religion debate what are found in this book are re hashed arguments that anyone with an interest in theology or philosophy will know well enough how is it that someone like dawkins comes to be known as one of the greatest thinkers of our time \? i'm afraid that after reading the god delusion i have no answer to this question
a superb book the cretins below who attack dawkins for being fundementally intolerent of religion miss the point as was writen wonderfully elsewhere
i was truly surprised by this book when i read it some years ago i was surprised by how engrossing and powerful it was , all the way through this man lived a tremendously interesting life , rich in great creative challenges and triumphs , rich in meetings and experience with remarkable people , rich in sexual adventures and complex human relationships the story of how the child of greek immigrants came to become the director of two of the classics of the american theatre death of a salesman and a 'streetcar named desire and of two of the great american movies , on the waterfront and east of eden is told with remarkable frankness and perceptiveness
with a former supreme court justice warning the usa today \( march 10 , 2006 \) about starting down the road toward a dictatorship , it seemes fitting to re visit the house un american activities committee \( huac \) in the 1950s when the right wing was trying to scare our citizens into giving the government supreme power , just as neocons are trying now
first , let me state i have often judged other people by their past actions was kazan wrong for providing names of alleged communist party members \? i ca n't answer this , and you should n't answer it , not until you read this book ! yes , kazan named names yes , he did ruin the careers of certain artists please , do n't judge until you have read his story ! this is an honest , masterful show business autobiography ! kazan was a fearless , authentic , visionary director he admits to adultery , poor parenting skills , and using people for his own good alfred hitchcock allegedly tortured tippi hendren during the filming of the the birds by having the little critters thrown at her face in repeated attempts why \? to foster the character 's psychological terror would you want that man house sitting for you while you are on vacation \? hell no can kazan be rewarded for his art , yet escape judgement for his past behavior \? you decide , but read his story first ! kazan 's films never shirked from dealing with pressing social issues , yet the movies are visual poetry hey , you try to make a movie about corruption on the brooklyn docks ! oh , and make it a heart wrenching allegory , a love story , and a black and white masterpiece ! one other thing , do n't forget that the mob basically controlled the docks at that time and were not too keen on being protrayed in an unflattering light ! !
i became a part of kazan 's world upon reading the first sentence of this remarkable book kazan raises candor to the level of literature , something most writers simply cannot do but it 's so worth aspiring to as a means of written communication
i knew absolutely nothing about elia kazan prior to reading this book he does a superb job of reconstructing his life from his early years learning theatre stage craft at yale all the way through to his final years \( he was 78 when he completed the book \) he is seemingly forthwright about many of the tough decisions he faced throughout his career from the house of unamerican activities revealing of many of his old 'comrades' , which he does a decent job of articulating why he did whatthat , even if on the surface it seems lecherous
this book is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies of the modern theatre kazan pulls no punches in depicting his epic journey from greek immigrant to one of the greatest theatre and film directors of all time his life parallels the crucial artistic movements and conflicts of the twentieth century the group theatre , the huac hearings , the height and fall of the hollywood studio system , the founding of the actor 's studio , and the development of the american theatre kazan , along with arthur miller and tennessee williams played a crucial role in creating a strong and vibrant american theatre all throughout this amazing journey are insights into the craft of acting as well as the trials and tribulations of a man struggling for personal identity this book demands to be on the shelf of any student , practitioner or fan of the theatre five out of five star
i have read this book four times i ca n't recall an autobiography of any century that is more candid , and is written with such extraordinary brio
i realize that they are postcards , but i do n't think i am going to be able to send them to anyone i love the artwork too much the colors are n't quite true to the actual pieces , but i am sure it was mass produced other than that , these are beautiful miniatures of the real thing
i read the works of folks like vince flynn , lee child , and , i thought , nelson demille , for the escape the action intrigue someting to make the plane flight go faster i do n't read for thinly veiled , current events , quasi political commentary \( there are recognized exports available for that sort of thing for example , a tour of duty in vietnam gives neither me , nor nelson , expert status on the conduct of warfare \)
once again de mille has written a provacative novel it is both enertaining and thought provoking i could hardly put it down it is one of his better pieces of work
for us demille fans , we 'll wait impatiently for the next book i wish they would come faster , but i understand that demille does a lot of research on his books , which is why they 're relevant and timely and he probably has a life , \( he 's engaged \? \) unlike some of us readers who want him to crank them out faster
i just finished wild fire and although it is not the best book i have ever read and most definetly not the best john corey book i have read , it is far from the worst
i am one of those demille fans that marks the launch date of his novels on my calendar , and plans all activities around being at my nearest costco to pick up one of the first copies this book was well worth waiting for with subject matter that , in this present time , was more than timely , and , not that far outside the realm of possibility it 's scary to think that people like bain madox , the villain , exist , but they do , and anybody who thinks wild fire was some sort of wild fantasy , needs to think back to some of the crazies we 've experienced so far in this life think about hitler , saddam , and that crazy little guy in north korea do we really think that america could not produce such a nut \?
an exceptional plot of how power corrupts suspenseful , entertaining , fascinating , and humorous with a touch of sarcasm throughout
let me preface this review by saying i am an ardent fan of nelson demille 's work and have read more than ten of his books including night fall , plum island , and \( my favorite \) the lion 's game i evaluate this book not for what it lacks but rather its entertainment value and how it made me ponder situations , predicaments , and circumstances
when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept , i resolved that i would alert other readers
this book has about 3 interesting chapters the rest is all dialog between a man and wife all this chit chat does nothing to further the plot , but simply takes up time and space there is no suspense until the 49th chapter take my word for it this book is not worth the , or time to read what a waste of talent
i lost count how many times the word myriad was used inappropriately
when i was a kid , i dreamed of being an astronaut that was n't to be , but this book inspired me to go into science and engineering and now i'm a successful programmer i 've heard the book influenced many other people similarly , including many who worked on the space program if you have similar interests , i think you 'll find rocket ship galileo absorbing , even if dated
this was heinlein 's first novel published in book form , and the first in his excellent juvenile series which included space cadet , time for the stars , starman jones , the star beast , tunnel in the sky , etc , and it is still my all time favorite heinlein manages to make believable the tale of a scientist \( dr cargraves \) organizing three 18 year old boys of a rocket club to build a nuclear powered moon rocket if you have an interest in space travel you 'll get sucked in and wo n't put the book down until it 's over , no matter how dated and unlikely the premise at first appears it is written with heinlein 's usual skill \( that earned him four hugo awards \) , and the characters are easy to identify with , especially for any young space enthusiasts this was also the basis for the 1950 classic film destination moon , although about all that remains unchanged in the film is the name dr cargraves in the book there is a veiled threat from unknown enemies that turn out to be nazis \( this was the first thing heinlein wrote after the war \) in the film there 's just a veiled reference to a communist threat i suspect the film also draws from heinlein 's more sophisticated treatment from the same period , the man who sold the moon
a daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first ever rocket trip to the moon that 's the premise of heinlein 's rocket ship galileo readers who are n't immediately turned off by the story 's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure to begin with , heinlein 's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once , a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years he skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story , \( as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place \) and he even manages to build some suspense , an effect heinlein is not usually noted for his descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting , despite being badly dated one real letdown is the characters , who are curiously undeveloped , even for science fiction the three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable , and doctor cargraves is n't much more distinctive if some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities , the readers might find them easier to identify with as it is , it 's hard to really care about these characters , even when something horrible happens to them the really big problem , though , is that this book really has n't aged very well for example , heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately , by one scientist and his youthful helpers , working on a shoestring budget , after a few months of labor when after all , any schoolchild knows that it took nasa and the u s government billions of dollars , working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade , to accomplish the real thing once our heroes reach the moon , the story gets even more improbable , as they find that the moon is already inhabited naturally , heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers , and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible as such , it was written for the tastes of the times , and times have changed dramatically for instance , the only women in this book are the boys' mothers , who have very little to say about anything important the villains are cartoonish stereotypes , who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse although the book is reasonably well written overall , and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet , today 's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing on average , if you 're old enough to remember sputnik , you can be forgiven for loving this book but if neil armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school , you probably wo n't be too impressed by rocket ship galileo
let 's say this right up front rocket ship galileo is not heinlein 's best novel but it just might be his most influential work , and given that the competition ranges from stranger in a strange land to his early groundbreaking science fiction before wwii , that 's saying a great deal after his return from civilian service for the navy , heinlein wanted to break out of the pulps he 'd written for before the war he did n't want to stay trapped he wanted to write for the slicks , for girls , for boys , for the movies , for nearly every market that he could break into rocket ship galileo is not his first novel he 'd written several novel length works for the pulps but it is his first work specifically written for young boys , and the first of the dozen or so juvenile classics to follow heinlein 's greatest literary hero , mark twain , had written for boys the market seemed open to him , and the money looked good heinlein always loved teaching young people , and this novel would prove his greatest triumph in that regard yes , the storyline is somewhat hard to believe three high school age boys get taken to the moon but that was right in the tradition of the tom swift novels that had sold so well to young boys yes , the ending is corny to us now , with nazis on the moon but in 1947 , the nazis has just been defeated , and they had been the world 's greatest rocket scientists it seemed perfectly plausible in 1947 the novel has n't dated well in some respects the dialogue is a bit cheesy , and the characters are a little hard to tell apart but it still moves with great excitement , and the science has n't dated very badly at all heinlein 's experience developing high pressure suits proved sufficient to create a space suit remarkably like that later developed so why is this novel so influential \? because it was read by hundreds of young men and women who went on to work in the apollo program in the sixties heinlein , in this very novel , had convinced them going to the moon was exciting , achievable , and important if any work of fiction has that kind of impact , it deserves to be read but in and of itself , rocket ship galileo is still a page turner , and a wonderful read enjoy
i first read this book many years ago , and i still reflect on it from time to time it changed the way i looked at the world simple in content , and perhaps a story out moded for the present adventures found in sf , it still has a particular value to the reader that will make it a favorite this book was about unbridled ambition a handful of young rocket enthusiasts and a instructor build a rocket ship and go to the moon utilizing their own wits and resources heinlein taps into the possibilities that could shape the future , and essentially poses the question 'how long will space exploration remain only a government exercise \? why could n't private citizens take it upon themselves to explore the stars themselves \? ' this entire book may seem simple at first glance , but i consider it an important and thought provoking concept for any dreamer with a vision at the time this was written , it was very much ahead of it 's time
i just love this book the author writes a sweet and simple story told from sally 's point of view but what really captures you are the beautiful illustrations stephen huneck 's work is sold at gallerys across the country and many of the pieces that he sells are images from the books i think that they are wood carvings cutting \? excuse my ignorance we also have sally goes to the farm both are lighthearted and fun they really make us all smile for anyone with a lab in their life this is a must have !
sally goes to the mountains is a book i would give as a gift to any dog lover from 4 to 94 it 's colorful illustrations , charming and witty captions , subject matter and size makes it the perfect coffee table book i 'll cherish mine forever i ca n't wait for the next sally book and plan to visit the huneck com website to choose a special framed print from this very special book
in sally goes to the mountains , author illustrator stephen huneck draws upon his award winning expertise to take young readers on a romp with a fun loving black labrador named sally sally goes for a ride to the mountains where she encounters bears , moose , rabbits , and skunks ! there are berries to pick , sticks to fetch , and a lake to swim in huneck 's bright , superbly crafted woodcut prints perfectly capture the joy of a dog 's outing in the mountains for young readers also highly recommended is the earlier volume of sally 's adventures , sally goes to the beach \( 0810941864 , price \)
i bought this book for my mom as a present she already owns the other sally books and loved this one too the illustrations are beautiful and very whitty my favorite is the giant moose with sally the sally books are n't just for lab owners or children any pet lover will enjoy them
miss rogers was a latin teacher in troy , new york for many years she loved latin and had a pleasant and loving attitude to her students it was from her that i first heard , omnia gallia in tres partes divisa est she made us memorize certain passages in her beloved language
this used to be the manual for every young noble going to war as an officer today it is a historical document showing the roman republic in war , and in particular a portrait of how the great ceasar would like his friends , enemies and history to see him this book has shaped the thinking of allmost every military commander for 2000 years , and it would be a shame not to read the words penned by the dictator himself
this is a remarkable document it is at once a manual on military strategy , on effective management of his troops , and on the psychology of the enemy but it is also a history , with smatterings of anthropology , sometimes our only source on a vanished pre roman way of life in what became france finally , and most difficult to grasp , there is a political subtext , in which caesar is communicating with both allies and rivals in rome , advancing his career while advising future leaders on proper conduct why did he mention certain things \? what did he omit \? what political image \( or self consciously enduring myth \) was he creating for himself \? there are few antique documents as fascinating and to boot it is a literary masterpiece of clear exposition and rapidly moving narrative once you read it and it must be read carefully and with references to other sources you will have no doubt that caesar was one of the greatest leaders of all time afterall , his name is the basis for tzar as well as kaiser !
julius caesar was one of the truly pivotal people in recorded history most non historians know him as the one who was stabbed by brutus on the ides of march it is almost as if caesar sprang full grown to grab the reigns of power from the senate in rome yet caesar had a fairly long life before he became first citizen of rome he was a successful general and a talented historian who saw world events with the dispassionate eye of one who felt supremely confident that his tenure as an army general was but the last stop before his ascension to ultimate power in his conquest of gaul , caesar uses the third person point of view to punctuate his tacit assumption that unfolding events ought to be divorced as far as possible from the one witnessing them this writing technique also served to symbolize his stated goal to conquer gaul to him , gaul was a land of barbarian tribes , with each possessing formidable numbers and fierce fighters these tribes and their leaders were enormously emotional , wildly unpredictable , and more dangerous as individuals than as organized units caesar knew that to beat them , he could not be as them they were emotional , he coldly calculating they were not efficient in massed groups , his legions had to be caesar was the ultimate practitioner of the divide and conquer school he picked off his enemies one at a time , like bobbing heads on a shooting gallery the atuatucii , the nervii , the helvetians all fought ferociously , sometimes winning minor victories , but it was caesar who won the ones that counted he transformed his legions into extensions of his personality they fought well as masses against overwhelming odds , not for their pay , or hope of plunder , or even for glory , but for their commander caesar 's iron will and resolve filled his legions with hope and his enemies with despair it was only when caesar was recalled to rome that the gauls decided that now was the time to seek a new leader to strike down the roman eagle during this battle against vercingetorix and his earlier ones against lesser chiefs , caesar sees each battle as the logical working out of a master plan , that when combined with the bravery and training of his troops in co ordinated combat , could crush a loud but awkward foe as he writes , one can visualize his intended audience , not the reader of this review , but the purple robed senators back in rome sweating out the increasing victories of a man who seemed fated to return to the capitol to tell them their business his calmness in battle was matched only by his calmness with a stylus it is truly ironic that it was this same calm that led him to discount the excited warnings of a mark antony , who tried to tell caesar of plotters , that led to his downfall
i have read the present classic book with great pleasure , but i nevertheless have had some feelings of not being completely satisfied with the editing i happen to possess the complete translation of ceasar 's gallic war published by an imprint of harvard university press and it occurred to me that in the present book several seemingly irrelevant passages have been left out and this strikes me personally as somewhat irritating of course , when one does not know the difference one probably wo n't mind at all , but i thought it might be useful to people out there who are in the moment of deciding whether or not to by the present book to know that it is not the complete version , and should they wish to come into the possession of this complete one they should rather purchase harvard 's gallic war i am not trying to downgrade the present book , but it 's just a matter of wishing to own a complete version of the work or not minding at all about such trivial things
if you can get past that the book was , at least in part , a piece of political propaganda for ceasar you will be able to enjoy the experience of hearing ceasar in his own words
so i pick up this book \( it was a gift from friends \) , and expect it to be dull and dry like tacitus or plutarch instead , caeser has me rolling \( well , not exactly \) with laughter he writes in a very historically accurate way , but since this is a piece of propaganda , he tends to lay the blame for mistakes on someone else , or rationalize his breaks from the roman authority caeser also belittles the natives of most of gaul \( except the belgae , the most fierce \) , and when he destroys an entire village , he states it in such a cool and nonchalant way \( and so the village was burnt , and all of the citizens put to the sword \) while caeser may not have intended to be funny , this book is a wonderful piece of history which must be taken as a historical tall tale
terrific for those of us that had trouble with the original latin at school fluent commentary on caesars exploits in gaul describes the geography of gaul , it 's people , politics , and roman \( read caesar 's \) attempts to pacify gaul this is the first hand account of the invasion of gaul that caesar sent back via courier to the senate and people of rome which enhanced his powerbase and set in motion the events the ides of march
this was a really good book it is good from the front cover to the back cover i would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys being transported to another time and place through words
matthew skelton 's debut novel features two storylines that intertwine like snakes across the centuries to lead us on a search for the book of all knowledge and power , endymion spring
i listened to the audiobook i usually become annoyed with books with skip to back story alot it did n't bother me much here
my son and i met the author last night he is wonderful and very fascinating in how he writes and how the characters come to life for him if you get a chance to meet him , take it !
i recomend this book to every new mom it explains everything that is happening and i knew what to expect before i went to my dr 's appointment it told me things my doctor did n't
my wife and i receieved this book as a gift when we announced her pregnancy it is by far our favorite pregnancy book the week by week format is perfect for following along with your progress and also makes it nice to read together there are even helpful hints for dads along the way
when i was pregnant my first time , i carried this around everywhere ! i was hungry for knowledge and this seemed to be the only book that i could refer to more frequently than just the month to month ! i had wished that there was a day to day book , but this came very close to providing me with new information as frequently as possible it is a staple of the pregnancy book diet !
i absolutely love this book i grabbed a pile of books at the bookstore and looked through each one carefully before selecting this one it is the only best selling guide written by a doctor with millions of copies sold and i know why now that i own it ! ! i do n't see the negative like some readers do it is written by a doctor , so it provides a lot of info that you 'd get by talking with your doctor every day ! so there are things that you should know about even if you do n't want to hear it or do n't think it will happen to you ! it explains things such as bleeding during pregnancy , some common medications to avoid to prevent birth defects , pollutants to avoid and why , stds during pregnancy , nutrition and sources serving sizes , how your actions affect your baby 's development \( vaccinations , smoking , xray , falling , safety , etc \) , possible tests , required tests , lying on your back , rh sensitivity , douching , sex , backaches , exercise guidelines , air travel , car safety , breastfeeding , pregnancy discomforts \( hemmorhoids , constipation , backaches , foot swelling , dizziness , breast itching , cramping , contractions \) , infections , hot tubs , jaundice it really is like having a doctor 's advice for each week of your pregnancy it relieved alot of the worrying about symptoms i was experiencing , realizing that i was normal
the greatest strength of this book is the week by week format it outlines specific changes that are pretty close to exactly as predicted we noticed many of the things and then read them that week , ie phlegmyness , inability to travel more than an hour and dryness at night just to name a few this book is very well balanced and it tends to focuses more on the positives of pregnancy and not the possible complications this is the 5th edition of this book with millions of copies sold overall it is a great help i definitely recommend it to all expectant couples these authors also wrote a number of supporting or complimentary books
this book is appalling it is disempowering to women , providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births \( with no reference to back it up \) , and generally gives a do n't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you attitude even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby
ok , so there might be some parts that are negative , but really how cool is it to tell your husband , partner , whatever that this week the ears will be growing and the baby will be able to start to hear things or the baby is now the size of a peanut look at the scaled drawing in the book of what our baby looks like ! i think that this is a great book always take things with a grain of salt , but this book rocks i buy it for all my friends that are having babies very informative , and the pics are really cool i thought this was the best book , way better that what to expect when you are expecting yuck !
i know that no book can cover every topic , but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases , but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness , which is much more common
this book is almost entirely week by week description , so the information is detailed i especially liked the dad tips that are included with each week there is also a tiny section on labor and lists of common events for the first several post partum weeks i liked the simple writing style , but i often did not find the extra information for each week relevent to what i was going through at the time i prefer you and your baby pregnancy your ultimate week by week by dr laura riley
we have this and the bible of maternity books , what to expect when you 're expecting but we may have well just thrown the other one away this book is great each weeks there is information on how your baby is developing many weeks have illustrations depicting what the baby might look like info on the size and development of the baby and what changes are happening to the mother 's body there are plenty of facts on things like nutrition and warning signs and symptions of disease and my wife 's personal favorite was the dad tip each week it really is a well written book it does n't overload you on information but keeps you aware of the mother 's changing body and the development of the baby a must have for any mother or father out there
my kids absolutely love this book every time they see a dog they do n't know , they ask what it is and look it up in the book there has n't been a dog they have n't been able to find yet the color photographs , not illustrations , are great i highly recommend this book , especially to kids who love dogs
this book is great for dog lovers i thought that the part about training your dog and such is dull because the pictures and accrual description of the dogs of the book is the best it is great for someone who wants to get a dog and find which one is perfect for you people whom already have a dog would not be board in this book i had already had a dog before i got this and it was fun trying to find my dog and my friend 's dog in this book i think that this book is great for all ages because just looking at the pictures if fun anyone who says this is an awful book must be wrong only thing is there are more dogs in the back that do not have a description which means you my not find you dog in this book
as much as i like the book , it was not what i though it would be this is a book about the various breeds explaining thme briefly to the child reader and introducing them by photos some of the best photos at a very reasonable price for those looking into the different breeds around
this is a great book that i use for 4 h quiz bowl it has complete breed descriptions for every breed in the akc it gives you the breed standard , a size comparison , and unique facts for every breed this book also has vital information for first aid , and health care great book for kids 8 and up
this book is the eleventh book in a series of unfortunate events this book follows the slippery slope and precedes the penultimate peril
when your last name is baudelaire , it is a known fact that you will somehow stumble upon trouble , no matter how hard you may try and avoid it when you 're last name is baudelaire and you 're an orphan , stumbling upon trouble increases tenfold which is why the baudelaire orphans \( violet , klaus , and sunny \) know instantly after they begin floating along the stricken stream that trouble is lurking around some vicious corner however , as they are not dolphins , seals , or fish , they did not expect their next bout of trouble to take place underwater but , alas , that is exactly where they find themselves on their next dreadful adventure having come across a submarine that is filled with three crew members \( captain widdershins , his step daughter fiona , and , lo and behold the baudelaire orphans old pal , phil \) , the baudelaire 's enter the underwater vehicle , and begin their next journey within a short while , the three orphans learn that captain widdershins is a member of v f d , and they quickly realize that he is on their side , willing to help them discover the truth about the fire that took their beloved parents lives however , when the orphans , along with fiona \( a young mycologist \) , prepare for a bit of deep sea diving , they soon find that young sunny has been infected with medusoid mycelium \( a deadly fungi \) now , the siblings are searching for a way to save their baby sister from a very certain death , without many supplies as if that were n't difficult enough for the baudelaire 's to endure , they have just discovered that count olaf is now trailing them under the sea , and plans on capturing them , and \( you guessed it \) claiming their fortune as his own
the grim grotto has violet , klaus and sunny aboard a submarine where a crazed captain is obsessed with finding the sugar bowl before count olaf while klaus starts getting close to the captain 's stepdaughter fiona she 's a book a worm too , well when it comes to learning about mushrooms one of the funnier parts has has her stepfather alreday planning their wedding and having the two blushing while saying and violet can marry my stepson once we find him again , aye ! the book has it 's slow points but it 's still one of the best of the books since it has some surprises plus when sunny gets poisoned by a deadly mushroom , klaus and violet have to figure out how to cure her and get away from count olaf at the same time
the grim grotto , book the eleventh in the unfortunate events series , picks up where book the tenth left off at the start , the baudelaire childrens are floating down stricken stream on a toboggan when a periscope suddenly comes out of the water the baudelaire children are unsure whether the people inside the submarine can be trusted , but you know how that goes if you 've already read the previous 10 volumes so on this adventure it begins with a submarine and continues through encounters with deadly mushrooms , tap dancing , a message from a lost friend , betrayal , and eventually a dark undersea cave
i love koontz but this book fell far from the mark it started off slow and i found myself thinking , where is this going \? and , in the end , i felt it took me nowhere and , the t s elliott quotes got a little annoying if you 're a fan like me , i know you 'll read it despite this review but if you 're a first time koontz reader , do n't start with this book it is definitely not his best work try odd thomas or even \( going way back here \) the funhouse instead
i 've read most of dean koontz' books and for the most part , i 've enjoyed all of them most of his books are what i consider just sci fi fantasy a good thriller read i think i 'd have given this one a 5 if there was less fantasy i got the feeling he wrote this book in the hopes it would become a screenplay , a combination of a king spielberg wannabe i listened to this on audio , my koontz first , and i found that in the midst of my road rage during rush hour traffic , i was n't missing a lot of the plot i really could imagine this on film , and given the length of the audio book , minus all of the flowery descriptions , it would make a great 2 hour movie however , i got a pleasant surprise at the end , and i absolutely loved it his explanation of armageddon vs alien invasion made the book , in my opinion it will make you think this was n't one of his worst books , it was one of his best give it a try
this was my first koontz book \( since then i 've read many \) and i think it 's still my favorite one reviewer said it will likely let you down , unless your favorite theme in koontz 's books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality well , yes ! that 's the whole reason i read koontz books otherwise i do n't think i 'd be able to sleep at night ! i love the redemption twist he writes into many of his stories \( the face , anyone \? \) anyone can write straight horror without hope , but koontz acknowledges a bigger picture , and i hope he keeps it up
i have been a fan of dean koontz for many years , but i stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago , because after awhile , it seemed as if all of his characters were the same i recently read the back cover of this book , and it sounded so interesting , so i gave it a chance boy , was i sorry it is as if dean koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student ! his sentences are awkward , mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side this was way too distracting , and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale
the foundation of success in a horror story is a strong , original beginning the author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief dean koontz failed to make this upfront investment in the taking the story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements stormy night , body snatchers , magic mirrors , ghouls , and \( koontz 's favorite \) delphic dogs before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non denominational rapture
i'm not a hard core dean koontz fan but i have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them \( at least enough to pick up another from time to time \)
i'm a fan of koontz but this book was a disappointment first of all it seems that not much happens molly , the main character , goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing it 's too cutesy with children and dogs \( koontz , please , the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired \) for most of the book it would be a 3 star book , but the ending is too cheesy and religious what will he write next \? a left behind book

`the encyclopedia of food and wine in america' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history , education , manufacture , marketing , personalities , and writing about food in america practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert given the size of the subject , it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out , as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality , plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today , so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books this means that this volume can sit beside the `larousse gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material these two giant books have two entirely different objectives while both works will have articles on potatoes , larousse will tell you how to cook them , but oxford will tell us were they are grown , their commercial importance , nutritional importance , and their appearance in cartoons
what makes this encyclopedia different from most other such comprehensive authoritative sources of information \? it 's a pure delight to read ! whether it 's discussing food mythology or the traditions of ethnic cookery or just any other culinary subject , these volumes are a great entertainment as well as real education truly a labor of love on the part of excellent , dedicated scholars and editors , it 's a great gift for any american who takes pleasure in reading as well as eating and drinking
as a child , i made a game of perusing the encyclopedia britannica by randomly flipping through its volumes until i found something of interest i remember feeling as though the whole world was at my fingertips waiting to be discovered
this is an indispensible reference tool whether you are just fascinated by food and drink and all things related or need information for backgrounding purposes i have found it very useful \( did you know that dr pepper was created by a pharmacist from waco , texas in 1885 \? \) the appendixes listing food websites , food museums , festivals etc are quite helpful also it 's well worth the cost and a must have for your libary , especially if you work in or deal with the food and beverage world and if you just love knowing random trivia you 'll love having these volumes to thumb through !
as a weekend gourmand , i found the entries in food and drink in america to be fascinating ! from the origins of apple pie and baking soda to the lore of tomatoes , this is an amazing collection of historically grounded , little known stories about the food we eat it is an indispensable reference book for anyone interested in food , cooking and american history not to mention a comprehensive source for culinary trivia a great conversation piece
jesus in beijing how christianity is transferring china and changing the global balance of power , is a personal account of a reporter who dedicated the martyrs for their faith from ce 635 to modern time
as china re emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century , much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world oddly , the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao 's disastrous reign , even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge , heavily populated , and \( from a western perspective \) oftentimes strange land aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china , as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country on a recent trip to china , i was highly impressed by the deep generosity , humility , resourcefulness , strength , perseverance , and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith this spirit is also , i believe , one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese also , those who are concerned that a christian china would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way
aikman turns a reporters eye to a careful analysis of the incredible move of god in mainland china over the past 30 years three significant movements are identified and explored the underground church the revival within the three self church and the unusual influence of christian scholars in chinese culture captivating reading but apparently the naming of names and inclusion of pictures of famous christians in china has led to some increased persecution
a vivid and compelling description of an incredibly important storyline virtually unknown outside \( or even inside \) of china
gospel under seige in communist countries has been narrowed down recently with the breakup of the soviet bloc , and now more predominant the oppression in muslim countries china has been one of those iffy places where publically the government would want us to believe there is religious freedom , but there are real doubts what is truly fascinating from this read is that china christians feel god 's call to the islam nations !
aikman wrote a fair history of of christianity in china , however he misrepresents what is going on in china today by far the biggest problem in the chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices this exists almost exclusively in the underground churches
the former beijing bureau chief for time magazine more or less accurately describes the state of the christian church in china , both underground and communist approved he particularly invests substantial portion of his book on the christians in henan province and accurately portrays the region as one of the centers if not the center of chinese christianity his approach to the research and description of the missionary work is still western oriented although he mentions korean and korean american missionaries frequently his presentation of the late jonathan chao as the father of modern chinese confessional movement who helped draft various chinese doctrinal confessions is very interesting , although the confessions are obviously a product of western educated chinese rather than a purely indigenous product because of this , the faith statements primarily deal with doctrines that interest the western church rather than accurately stating what concerns the chinese christians the most the book is about 90 how christianity is transforming china and 10 changing the global balance of power his vision for pro america china is narrow and parochial at best china must become more than a helper to america in the world stage a christian china that leads the world as a true leader would also show leadership in world mission to the rest of the world
i usually try not to be too mean to a new author \( as i am one , myself \)
i thoroughly enjoyed this book the characters were complex and interesting , although at times a little bewildering the world building was good there was a strong sense of a developed and unique culture and magic system
music plays a major role in this book the main character is a highly sought after singer and i like the way isaak handles the music rather than try to write a collection of songs , i 've never seen this done successfully \( writing stories does not make you a song writer \) , she focuses on the songs story and the emotion it triggers in the singer and his audience it 's as if the music is a living object excellent i found this book riveting , with lyrical prose , compelling characters , and a story that made it hard to put down i ca n't wait for her next book
the singer 's crown captivated me from the start , with the nefarious uncle , and later the scheming grandmother , coupled with a variety of plot lines author isaak effortlessly keeps interwoven until the surprising end there 's magic in them , thar family jewels \? i was invested in her secondary characters and enjoyed how she let them be strong in their own right this was n't strictly a good vs evil plot the hero was young and distracted by what he lacked , and the heroine was overawed by her protectors nevertheless , it made a compelling read , and i look forward to isaak 's next book with eager anticipation
in 1215 in the kingdom of lochalyn , thorgir murders his brother the king , kills his nephews except the youngest prince rhys , and when his sister in law queen caitrin refuses to cooperate , he slays her too none are buried properly he completes his dastardly coup by having a surgeon insure that rhys would never have whelps and he would qualify as a singer with the virgins of the goddess
the author weaves a complex tapestry with this novel there are depths of this world that make me want to dig deeper the nature of the magic , and its hold on people do n't ask ! it would n't be wise her characters have a depth of texture prince rhys not your typical aggressive swash buckling hero for reasons painful to consider is drawn inexorably to fight to regain the family crown if not the family jewels surrounded by a rich suite of other characters princesses , dukes , wizards and the lower echelons of society as well pursuing their own agendas in shades of grey that provides a credibility often lost in fantasy not a children 's book a darker story path , with more twists and more reward , for this reader at least
stupendous ! clever , engaging characters made this a difficult book to put down i was rooting for durhys from the start

containing some of the funniest scenes i 've read in ages , jennifer gilmore 's accomplished first novel traces three generations of three overlapping families , all immigrants who settled in brooklyn , showing how families , their values , and cultural commitments change across generations her appreciation of life 's ironies and her obvious love for her characters allow her to create a gentle , loving satire of the jewish immigrant experience and show its universality

these stories are delightful , the illustrations are superb i bought a copy for my grand daughter , and was so enthralled that i ordered a second copy for me !
i have a very independent 14 year old daughter who does not respond well to being told what to do using love and logic strategies works really well with her if i ask her what her plan is for homework tonight , she gives me a reasonable plan and does it , which is much better than yelling at her all night long to get it done this works in a lot of different situations for example if i ask her what the consequence should be \( before hand \) if she does n't get her room cleaned when she says she will , there is a lot less arguing about doing her room or about the consequences if she does not get her room clean
google the words foster cline and attachment therapy , and be prepared to lose your lunch happy research
this book helped me put a lot of parenting into perspective i found that the take home messages of the book are easy to remember the key one for me was , who owns the problem \? what a concept the premise is that rescuing my kids from the consequences of their actions is a lousy way to teach kids responsibility the section on grounding of kids was great too this book is making me question practically every aspect of my knee jerk parenting responses highly recommended
i found the book had some ideas that helped , but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual , but i did n't appreciate the religious opinion it gave
this book was recommended by my son 's therapist for us to read as a new way to parent i found the book quite interesting and it gave me some new thoughts we have incorporated some of the suggestions in the book and have had a lot of success with it i'm not sure if i could do all the responses to certain situations , but many chapters in which there were responses that we could use it does take an open minded parent , and those parents who are drill sgt parents will have a tough time using this book unless they are willing to change
i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making \( and the consequence of their decision \) remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors do n't want you to leave the decision with the teens , they want to take that one back , which weakens the premise they present
bought this book for my husband he has 14 yr old daughter from previous marriage dh does not read books , but i pushed him to just try the first 2 chapters he is still reading even admitted that it was a really good book he is using some of the techniques with his daughter he seems much less stressed time will tell if the techniques work with teen
i decided i needed a different approach with my teenagers when my son came home with a green mohawk and a big bush tattoo \( george w , that is \) one day and my daughter said she wanted to get a couple of nipple rings that would have sunk the bismarck this book really helped me take control of the situation now i have the green mohawk and the nipple rings and my teenagers think i'm the coolest dad around , and they 're as obedient as can be who would have believed it \? but i owe it all to this book highly recommended
with several hundred amazon rave reviews , it seems overkill to add another , but what the heck the lincoln lawyer is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best connelly 's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars \( the drinking bars as well as the ones before which you conduct trials \) borders on magic the plot here is amazingly diabolical just when you think you know where it 's going , connelly pulls the rug away haller is a wonderful character , delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a \( somewhat tarnished \) heart of gold i hope connelly keeps bringing him back but i hope he does n't retire bosch , either i think connelly should turn out two books a year one of each guy i know it wo n't happen , but i can dream thanks again , mr connelly , for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights
how do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you 've ever read \? this was a well paced , highly entertaining story , but the book 's real success is its longevity you continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it hands down , this is connelly 's best novel few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end mick haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works to him , it 's a machine , and he 's the greasy angel who keeps it well oiled even though haller 's cynicism is a constant source of amusement , his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client , who can pay top dollar accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman , louis roulet hires his services what first seems to be a straight forward case , will ultimately test haller to his limits his family will be threatened , he will be accused of a crime , and someone very close to him will die not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system , the writing is first rate
i got this book unabridged on cd i would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects my wife and i usually have our own books that we 'll read together , but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too , even though she was n't listening to it to begin with upon discovering i had listened to some without her , my wife was like , what \? you listened to it without me \? ! my response was , i did n't even think you were listening to it that 's how hooked you can get on this story
michael haller 's life revolves around criminal defense , his an attorney operating out the back of his lincoln town car his appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy , people either called him mick or mickey tall , dark and intelligent with his good looks and irish blood lines made him a catch in the court room he was very together with great timing , in his personal life it was a mess , at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter his father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to , his father wrote books and practised law that did n't have room for innocent clients , so far mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just would n't recognize innocence if it came along being an independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll , he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who could n't afford to pay his fees in total he kept four lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour , what he was really looking for was a franchise player , a case to keep the cash rolling , point blank a meal ticket
very interesting cast of characters , would make an enjoyable tv show , more original than what is on today
connelly really brings the characters to life the farther into you get , the faster you want to turn the pages
the lincoln lawyer is hilariously and profoundly true if you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a high powered criminal attorney , this book will show you i am a civil attorney , myself , and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law \( not that civil trial law is without its warts either \)
michael connelly is the best , and this new direction will hopefully going to continue good read
i loved this book the pacing was perfect , the characters well drawn , and the writing style engaging mickey haller , the lincoln lawyer of the title , and protagonist , is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his lincolns he gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker the author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read this is the first michael connelly book i 've read , but based on this one , i'm going back to read his others
criminal defense attorney , mickey haller , is thrilled to find himself in the position of defending louis ross roulet against a charge of attempted rape and aggravated sexual assault with grievous bodily injury for his alleged attack of reggie campeau , a hooker with a past roulet is what experienced attorneys call a franchise client he 's willing to be billed full schedule a top dollar legal fare , he 's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense but roulet 's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens haller because , despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not , haller becomes convinced of his client 's innocence he recalls his deceased father 's advice to other lawyers , the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man
is religion irrelevant to modern society \? should we cast theism overboard \? i do n't know , but i'm interested in the dialogue , and in this book , dennett offers an interesting perspective on these and other questions about religion
dennett is very gentle in laying out his case , but his conclusions are earth shattering
ironically , dennett \( and dawkins and darwin \) provide sophisticated believers with the best tools ever for understanding how a god might have purposefully injected the human memosphere with permanent belief in himself and endowed his believers with the sense of purpose , intentionality , goal seeking , and teleology that keeps religion alive and growing a god can accomplish all that simply by imbuing the universe with darwinian selection , since all darwinian systems exhibit an epiphenomenal teleology so realistic that we might as well just define real intentionality as the behavior of individuals \( memes or genes \) struggling for survival in darwinian system
it is not difficult to dismiss daniel dennett 's latest work , breaking the spell , as an under researched and unscholarly polemic containing many assertions that are dubious and unproven at best dennett , of course , would agree the book says from page one that it is not intended to be a scholarly work , nor is it intended to offer definitive proof as to the evolutionary origin of religion if this were what the book were trying to offer , then perhaps the ranting and raving about dennett 's lack of scholarship and his unverified claims would be more to the point as it stands , though , breaking the spell succeeds in getting its intended message across , and it does so in a manner that would not frighten off its intended audience the average lay theist
but i 'll throw him a bone with a second star \( see end of review for why \)
daniel dennett is a very good writer and his books are always worth reading although i do n't always agree with his views , i have always been impressed by his basic fairness and honesty \( on the whole \) since i read darwin 's dangerous idea , a thoroughly delightful work on evolutionary thought thus when one of my colleagues loaned me breaking the spell religion as a natural phenomenon i was prepared for an interesting exposition unfortunately , i only had a chance to peruse the book , rather than read it in detail , but i got the main ideas and i did read some sections more thoroughly
mr dennett 's book demonstrates the ignorance , irrationality , and dishonesty of humanists discussing the meaning of word materialsim , professor dennett says
tim lahaye , jerry jenkins , and others in the pre trib circle , such as ed hindson , tommy ice , chuck missler , etc , continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early church , and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived \? tim cohen , in his excellent book , the antichrist and a cup of tea , provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that , the same author \( tim cohen \) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture \( based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah , history , and the tribulation period series \( see prophecy house 's web site , prophecyhouse dot com , for details on these items \)
this is a nice fold out chart of the whole biblical scenario from a dispensational view it makes a good reference and book mark for my bible i would also recommend lahaye and ice 's book charting the end times , it is fully comprehensive
i must seem like someone in great need of a unifying philosophy , because several people have tried to lend me theirs ex boyfriends seem to think daoism just the thing , while acquaintances recommend jesus \( that 's why they stall out at acquaintances \) after reading this book , though , i can now say , no thanks i 've got adam smith
the book under review was published by libertyclassics
this book , the first published by adam smith , was very favorably received when it was first appeared in 1759 within a few generations , however , it was largely neglected due to various turns taken in moral philosophy smith 's approach is to paint the moral aspect of living in vivid colors , so that it literally inspires virtuous conduct but in doing so , smith never preaches instead , he illustrates the beauty of virtue even over the practical advantages of living as though one were an ideal observer or spectator this perspective plays a large role in his work , for according to smith the moral perspective , and indeed conscience itself , is largely a function of adopting the point of view of the person principally concerned in morally relevant situations , and subsequently sympathizing with the perspective of the various parties involved sympathy for smith is not soft heartednes \( nor headedness \) , but is instead identification with the motives and feelings of the parties involved the volume includes one part devoted to an examination of the history of ethical theory , interpreted through the lense of smith 's own sentimentalist theory one thing that should be noted about the theory of moral sentiments is that it goes a good way in correcting the impression that smith was a laissez faire capitalist , and indeed the sentiments expressed here make it clear that the popular conception of smith as first and foremost an economist concerned with automatic regulation resulting from an invisible hand \( a phrase used only twice in all of smith 's writings , as explained by the editors in the excellent introduction to this volume \) , do not mesh well with the historical facts he was a professor of moral philosophy at glasgow university , and is reputed to have declared himself most proud , not of his most \( and justly \) famous , the nature and causes of the wealth of nations , but of this book instead indeed , his headstone reads , here lies adam smith , author of the theory of moral sentiments and of the wealth of nations the book 's major shortcoming is its ultimately unsatisfying appeals to human nature at junctures where people clearly have disagreements smith 's defense of retributive justice is an example , for today we might well see ourselves as involved in a struggle to move beyond such a conception of what constitutes appropriate behavior , despite the natural propensity that we may have toward it despite its age , this book will inspire and challenge people now struggling with moral dilemmas , and the comparatively confusing moral climate of our own time it is good to see it in print , and it is good to see moral philosophers and others beginning to discuss its significance once again i recommend it highly
dave mckean , cages \( comicslit , 2002 \)
there are really no words i can write to do this one justice it 's one of the single most moving experiences i 've ever had reading anything , never mind comic books mckean 's line art is breathtaking , and the painted interludes and photo montages are every bit as fascinating , disturbing , and touching as anything he 's done with neil gaiman or grant morrison the story is about a tenement and its various occupants , but it 's also about inspiration and love , and the things that drive us to create go read it
this truly is a brilliant work in its own right 500 pages of magnificent art work coupled with wonderful stories of human interaction , hope , struggle , and triumph the stories do tend towards the ambiguous side at times , but it does n't distract from the overall enjoyable time spent reading this truly is a gem , and should be on the shelf of every comic book fan
cages is that rarest of graphic novels a work that can be called art and not just entertainment the multiplicity of visual motifs from a very basic pencilled line that is very impressive to painting and highly skilled photo collages show a visual versatility that is formidable by itself i was surprised at the skill of his writing , at first reading , i thought cages was merely a self referential book on the nature of creativity but further readings show that the novel also discusses the nature of god , sex and human relationships and the way in which any or all aspects of human existence can tun into a cage if one does not have balance and perspective the jazz musician poet is the character who comes closest to having this and is the most admirable character in the novel he is able to live outside of the cage most of the time this graphic novel meets the definition of art in that second and even seventh readings or viewings add to the experience while well done entertainment has little to say beyond a first or maybe second reading , all serous comics lovers should read cages and preferably more than once nbm took over the publishing fromthe defunct former publisher so it should be easier to find or get by way of special order
this is probably the best comic book ever written artist dave mckean , whose art i have long time admired , proves that he can write as well , or better , than his old partner , neil gaiman he used to do all of gaiman 's art and gaiman 's later work has suffered with the absence of mckean 's art work this is an almost 500 page hardcover book that tells a story about creativity and creative people there are three central characters an artist , a writer and a musician poet they all live in the same apartment building and they interact with one another as well as the muse that lives inside each of them and torments each of them the story is not told in stricly linear fashion and mckean frequently will break away from dialogue and narrative and into visuals to carry the story for awhile he does it all equally well the rumor i heard is that the publisher went out of business shortly after publication of the book and that is why it is not available dave mckean , who is a very successful artist in the uk , should look into his rights in publishing this himself as a reissue since too few people are experiencing the joy of reading and seeing his work
my favorite exercises in college were always related to game theory i'm guessing that james surowiecki has a similar penchant , which would explain why his book is one of the most accessible volumes dealing with elements of it my biggest critique is a personal one , that the book contain more of the actual mathematical analysis of his case studies of course , that would 've made the work less accessible , less popular and i might have never read it
surowiecki is a talented writer and one , who along with blink author malcom gladwell , utilizes a writing style that includes myriad interesting scientific studies and historical anecdotes he starts off with a fascinating story about some fair , at which he witnesses hundreds of people guessing the weight of a cow no one got the exact weight of the cow , but the average guesses from everyone in the crowd was right on the money this may seem like a coincidence , but suroweicki goes on to describe many cases where the many come to astonishing conclusions , that the few could rarely come to
this is not a book about management it is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals it sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens
what an outstanding book ! i would not be exageratting by saying that this book has influenced me , particularly my leadership style , more than any other the ideas therein pop into my head several times a week , as the wisdom of crowds rears its head over the course of my day examples include viewer ratings on youtube , student ratings of teachers at the school where i work , online doctor ratings by patients , movie recommendations by the masses on netflix , and more the collective people 's opinions are generally dead on even when individual opinions vary this is the premise of the book , and one that i am now firmly convinced of
intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new web 2 0 universe , i was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis from the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis \( that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group \) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author 's argument the book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance i would qualify it as a light business read , entertaining but not quite convincing if you 're not part of the choir
if you want to know more about the importance of shedding all political alliegences and affiliations , read this book what a wonderful body of knowledge with just the right stories to highlight the profound insights into the recesses of our heart
this book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book \( this has been noted by others \)
james surowiecki 's the wisdom of crowds is a readable and understandable book that attempts to bring an esoteric concept and present it to the layman surowiecki 's thesis is simple a group of people that is diverse , independent , and decentralized usually reaches a better solution to a problem than even the best experts
the author , james surowiecki , lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly the examples are all easy to relate to , and i found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text
i am an adult with adhd inatintive type i have struggled all my life with this condition howevere , i have managed to earn a ba in psychology and i am currently working on a masters degree because of my expierences in psychology classes i know something about scientific research and empirical evidence this book was a major dissapointment to me because it lacks the simple scholary research to prove the claims made by dr lawless i am afraid this book is nothing more then modernday snake oil that will cause more harm then good
there are many great ideas presented in this book about dealing with your add child , but the chapter on meds is completely off base let me preface the following with my opinion \( i am not an md or an expert \) that children with add need a team approach in helping them deal with the condition \( if you choose to call it one \) and there is a place for meds for many kids , but it is only a piece of the puzzle parents , teachers , family members , md 's , and behavioral specialists are all crucial i happen to work indirectly with many of the world thought leaders and experts on add \( ie joseph beiderman , mass general hospital , boston ma harvard medical school , look up his credentials \) first dr frank lawlis is not an md , this means he has not been to medical school that is not to say he is n't a great psychologist , just that he has not and does not write prescriptions for these meds and has no first hand experience with directly managing these meds himself in this book there are many things that are completely false regarding add meds for example he states that they only work for about 50 of kids false let me cite 3 credible sources that disputes this \( notice in the book that he does not talk about his credible source \)
while raising a son with add i have read many books and articles which seem to advocate one treatment or another i find this book has a family centered approach solutions involve the family rather than the just the add child and , while the book does give some intriguing alternatives to the usual medication regimes , it does not rule them out all together i liked this book for the new ideas it presented without insisting that these are the only ones which will work the author seems knowledgeable , has had a long practice and includes some personal experiences to illustrate his ideas
i do n't quite understand why some are discounting lawliss' suggestions because he is a psychologist and not an m d most m d s who suspect that a child exhibits symptoms of add adhd refer the parents and child to a psychologist , who will properly diagnose and , if necessary , treat the child at least , in my experience , this is the normal course if psychologists are the experts in this arena , then what 's the problem \?
this book has very pertanent information that parents , teachers , and other people working with add children need
dr lawliss notes in the add answer that we should not put teachers , doctors , or dr lawliss himself above our parental observations and intuition there are some unproven methods in this book , but there is also a ton of insight on family dynamics and treating the environment of the child learn from this book and then you decide how or if to apply the methods i have been putting teachers on a pedestal , believing they know more about child behavior no more of this they know more about children in general , but i know my own child best , and being that i am willing to honest with myself and my child i can effectively use what is pertinent to our situation from this book
according to the nimh there are about 1 6 million cases total if the rest of this book is as accurate as that statistic then , well , that pretty much says it all
in this book 's intro it says , it 's no coincidence you opened this book then you see , everytime a coincidence occurs , a prayer is answered , or something happens to make you say , 'wow ! what are the odds of that happening \? ' you 've received a godwink , a signpost along the path to your destiny a message of reassurance that you are never alone

i really enjoyed this book by squire rushnell , almost as much as the first one of his that i read both books , which we have come to call the god winks books , are great and a necessary item for everyone 's home library
i found this to be another good book by the author his eye opening first book when god winks was truly exceptional and this book is close to living up to that standard his thoughts on love and relationships are insightful this is a very good book
this is an adorable book of evidence that would make anyone afraid of their partner 's previous relationships , especially if the past boyfriends , girlfriends , and most of all spouses are still alive and kicking
this is the second book i have read by this author and i loved them both very uplifting , fun and thought provoking ! makes you believe in love , coincidence , and the core of goodness in so many people a great read i highly recommend it !
i just want to say that this book was one of the best books that were ever written and one of the best books i 've personally ever read if you beleive or dont beleive in love , this book is a great book to read it opens your eyes to a whole new world and things you never thought were even possible i read this book in 1 1 2 days and i loved it if you have little free time here aand there , i think you should definately give the book a shot and read it it 's a small book kind of , but i now find myself going back to it sometimes and referring to certain sections good luck !
i thought this book was very intersting ! the book was very easy to read and very informative i related to the book in many ways i agree with what squire says about love and relationships i learned alot of what he says about godwinks and love it was very much like the first book which made it easy to understand
very compreshensive from how to name and label photos as you import them to what type of disks to use for backups he covers thousands of details that i would not have thought about is clearly geared toward professional level of photo indexing however , he offers helpful suggestions for any level of digital photographer
i am a fairly serious photographer with over 5000 cataloged images stored in iviewpro i also use photoshop cs2 so i have pretty much the same setup as peter krogh uses for his book i probably shoot a couple hundred images a month , of which maybe 5 get archived and saved
extremely usefull roadmap to navigating the new territory of digital workflow if you are a professional photographer shooting digitally , this book is the essential guide to everything you need to capitalize on digital 's opportunity and avoid time consuming mistakes i feel like an evangelist , as i 've bought a handfull of copies for colleagues
one of the most difficult realities of managing thousands of digital photo images is how to label them in a consitent manner so that you can easily retrieve photos and keep track of photos that have been altered another important consideration is if you will be able to read the information as software and hardware changes occur peter krogh makes logical suggestions and tells you why he chose to label an image in a particular manner the dam book also has great suggestions on backing up photos i have always struggled with labeling numbering consistency , peter krogh makes it all very logical
any photographer who is serious about their craft needs to take a good look at the dam book this book was written by a true professional that knows their stuff and will assist you in getting your photos from the the boxes and boxes scattered no doubt throughout your house and into the digital repository that is a better place to store , access , and retrieve the precious prints that you work so hard on producing
the dam book is a seminal work on a topic of considerable importance to the serious digital photographer , and krogh clearly knows what he 's talking about and does an excellent job of explaining without going overboard if you 're at all interested in the question of how to file , archive , and index your digital photos , you should read this book
this is an important first book on dam it would have been helpful from the beginning to have a simple outline of the workflow steps , rather than illustrations of various phases throughout the book also , the work is too heavily dependent on adobe and dng his arguments that dng is the universal format of the future seem rather unsupported by facts and history that said , this is a very well written book with enough universals to be highly recommended it is a must read for the digital photographer
for someone who used to store all there metadata in html files , this book gave some much needed information
even if like me , you 're not shooting gigs of digital images a year , the krogh book is a must read i'm no longer a pro shooter but i do need a handle on effective archiving schemes for my images peter does an excellent job of explaining his system that allows users to archive , organize and find your images well though out system that makes sense while i'm no longer a working pro shooter , i still have associations with pro 's i went to photo school with \( years before digital \) or folks i work with and i recommend they pick up this book and read it cover to cover
the book had a lot of helpful experiences and perspectives one can view in life it broadens one 's thinking and challenges us to see how we can better the quality of life that we live references to the bible i believe is the true key

i ordered this book thinking that it would help put some things in perspective what i got was a total eye opener i have to admit , the man knows what he 's talking about i did n't think it would be as religious as it is , but i'm deeply involved anyhow
this miniature edition is too small to be of much value when i purchased it , it was not at all obvious that it was a miniature edition , and i was shocked when it arrived if you 're already familiar with the book , it may be a helpful reminder , but it is no way to become familiar with dr peale 's work it is not worth the 4 95 i paid for it , and the 3 99 shipping and handling is ludicrous
this littel minature book is very powerful it has all the necesarry positive thing techniques that you need to start changing the way you think if you practice and beleive in it it will turn your life around for the better
as a long time sufferer of anxiety panic disorder , i recommend this book to anyone who is looking for coping mechanisms though not specifically geared towards people with anxiety , the book offers many pracitcal options for dealing with fear and uncertainty a great place to start
this is a great book a book that can be of help to a teenager , an employee , a businessman , a live in mom or to a retiree the book tells of changing our attitudes by the way we think norman writes that by thinking positive thoughts we draw in positive results and in the same way we draw in negative results by thinking negative thoughts its more like a magnet pulling iron towards itself therefore the bible says as a man thinks in his heart , so he is as i said before a really great book otherwise it would not have been an all time positive best selling book
this book has definitely changed my life i recommend it to anyone who is at a low especially it has given me a new outlook on life and helped me become a positive person i was very jumpy , nervous , even depressed before , this book really helped me to take my time and calm down i now know that i can handle things much bette
dr peale is a master at describing and articulating the manifesting power of poitive thinking and believing he simply writes about the truth of thinking yourself into success great book that i read over and over again definitely an inspiration for the writing of my own book
as a christian , this book was incredibly inspiring i recently finished it and lately , when i come across a problem at work or school i remember various methods of thinking in order to solve the problem if there is no solution to the problem , i use a couple of methods to view the problem dr peale uses countless examples and stories of experiences of people that have changed or developed by faith in god and the following of christ
this is the story of elizabeth turrill bentley no one suspected a well bred , vassar educated descendent of puritan clergy would join a communist party and run two of the most productive spy rings in america that is exactly what bentley , code name clever girl , did equally unexpected was her transformation from spy to fbi informant
liz bentley was born in a society that had limited opportunities for women in the 1930 's with the great depression this vassar graduate had only the socila outlet of the communist party
although the life of elizabeth bently deserves a bigger book , i enjoyed this first biography of the enigmatic but fascinating commie spy , elizabeth bently the author attempts to explain this vassar educated american woman who became a russian spy , but bently still remains a vague phantom since i'm fascinated by that whole period of joe mccarthy , alger hiss , the shocking presence of real life commnists in american government back in the 30s and 40s i found this book very readable you might also enjoy related books , especially ann coulter 's best selling , treason , hich really delivers the goods about how the communist scare of the 40s and 50s was not the imaginary fear of paranoid americans it really was something to cause genuine fear elizabeth bently revealed just have intensive this spy network was
the subject of the book is hard to understand , even with all the facts laid out so admirably kessler 's writing style commands attention without getting in the way of the facts , but those facts are so twisting that at times even the most diligent student of history may be confused that 's a small quible , however , in an overarching work of vigor and suspense well worth a read
hope mirrlees originally published this marvelous book back in the 1920s , to some acclaim at the time the book then was forgotten by all except a few lovers of fantasy until it was republished by the now legendary sign of the unicorn series put out by ballentine in the 1960s and early 70s many authors have tried , with varying degrees of success , to achieve what mirrlees does so effortlessly she brings a true sense of the mystery and wonder to this story of a people who live on the borders of fairlyland in this book , we learn about nathaniel chanticleer and his son about a people who would rather not see fairyland , but who are in some ways inextricably linked i do n't want to say too much , or give too much away about this wondrous story , but i would like to say that one phrase has stuck with me for a long time one character accidentally wears yellow to a funeral , and then comments that it was , after all , a blackish sort of yellow true words of the genuine synesthete , yes but also true words of those who have touched the fe i am just delighted that this is back in print i hope everyone reads and enjoys it !
this book was extremely well written it 's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all what totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time , i have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20 's she most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end for example , on page 233 , and if all the gifts of life are good , perhaps , too , are all the shapes she chooses to take , and which we cannot alter the book is filled with hints at the time period even though , after looking at countless reviews , the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that lud in the mist did not and it was a fantastical piece of literature in my opinion , this book was totally based on the time period there 's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he 's not white anymore he has come down in the world if you 're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20 's , this is an astounding piece
i like the book , its cute and weird , but i lost mine when i had it with me dining at the mall and took it with me into the movie theater there , forgot it in the theater isle during the movie when i set it down and never saw it again
lud is n't london , and dorimare is n't england , although there are some resemblances dorimare is bordered by fairyland , although these days it does its very best to ignore that fact two or three centuries ago , under duke aubrey , it was different trade between the two lands was thriving , and the people of dorimare enjoyed eating fairy fruit but the merchants rose up and drove duke aubrey out he was capricious and bad for business and now mention of fairy is banned as indecent , and fairy fruit is so illegal that smugglers of it have to be prosecuted for smuggling silk
i can tell this is an unusual fantasy just by checking out the main character most fantasy heroes are not round , stodgy , middle aged men who are respected pillars of the community but the enchanting fantasy lud in the mist , reminiscent of the hobbit in some areas , stars just such a man , amid dozens of other nice ordinary boring people who get their lives magically turned upside down
lud in the mist was first published , to both some incomprehension and some critical success , in the 1920s it opens with , as an epigraph , a reflection by the author 's friend and sometime collaborator , the classicist jane ellen harrison , on the otherwise inexpressible longings revealed in myth the setting is the land of dorimare , which is certainly not england , but is something like it just as the seaport of lud in the mist is not exactly london in the fog for one thing , england never had such remarkably interesting neighbors as does dorimare at least not across any merely geographical border not that the solid , and increasingly stolid , burghers of lud have any intention of acknowledging fairyland or its inhabitants that nonsense was all done away with in a glorious \( but not the glorious \) revolution , by their brave , revered , but \( now \) embarrassingly enthusiastic , ancestors , who chased the last duke , and the priests , off to well somewhere over the border
what a pleasure to have this superb novel in print once more ! i can only echo the praise of the previous reviewers on this page , all of whom were obviously touched by this neglected classic as deeply as i was while there 's a glut of fantasy novels available these days , all too many are lacking in true magic a poetry both crisp and lyrical , an understated but rich symbolism , a sense of the mysteries , that is the essence of lud in the mist add to that its subtle and delightful characterization , its often cheerfully earthy humor \( by my great aunt 's rump ! \) , and the sheer beauty of its prose , and you have a book that belongs on any short list of fantasy masterpieces a book to be read many times , one that takes the reader ever deeper with each reading may it never be out of print again
dont know much about history does pretty much what it purports to do fill in certain blanks in us history in a concise , almost too concise , manner it is quite objective and makes no attempt to re write history to promote a particular political leaning until the final chapters then it is fairly clear that dr davis leans a bit away from the status quo this poses no real problem , as most of the viet nam generation are quite negative as to how that was handled now , the next edition of this book , which will of necessity deal with irak , will be a very interesting read
this was absolutely the funniest parody i have ever read the eager repetition of the supremem court interpreted the 14th amendment to give civil rights to corporations as the single worst argument to ever come forth from that body was one of the funniest lietmotif 's in this hysterical parody of us history told from the standpoint of an over the top marxist worse than cowboys were businessmen ! ! eugene debs and web dubois were the only white americans who were not evil !
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one to notice the anti white preaching in this book not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that i was expecting to learn a lot more most of the things mentioned i already knew i graduated from high school in '89 and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education
davis 's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling white men were all bad , indians were good women were brave conservatives are anti semites republicans are bad and pro business anti communism was silly and all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor 's filter mr davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy this is offensive when it neglects margaret sanger 's racism , and communist depredations
kenneth c davis presents an unvarnished look at the history of america from columbus to mid 2002 his viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that america is always right and good , but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way for example , it exposes jackson , sherman , and others for their mistreatment of the indians but does n't actually condemn them it explains washington and jefferson 's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them
i do n't know if this is one of the essential historical works , but it is definitely one of the most fun kenneth davis strives to provide a remarkably comprehensive and centrist survey of american history by addressing a series of questions that structure the work as a whole for the most part , he articulates the standard current few of the various figures he treats
short , concise , and to the point chapters great wealth of knowledge and trivia
the comment on editor \( using the reviewer 's sacred space \) is not out of place amazon has a different logic to treat people in the previous incarnation amazon com had an option for author 's to comment now , i presume , it is turned into guide
this is an excellent walking book because it is so informative and motivational ! it provides oodles of information about what shoes to wear , what gear to wear , winterize your walking program , how to walk off your weight , a routine for the road , how to prepare for a 5 k or a marathon , and dynamic walking routines and everything else you need to know i highly recommend this book to the beginner or advanced walker this book has inspired me to walk three \( 3 \) 5ks in the past four months and i now walk on a daily basis ! just buy it and read you 'll like it !
i have enjoyed maggie spilner 's writings for many years and it 's great to find her walking wisdom packed into one book ! i especially recommend this book if your inner sloth needs to be reminded \( as mine does \) to get out and walk every day !
this book is a good read two others that were better for me from a walking program perspective are the 90 day fitness walking program by mark fenton \( great walking program for the couch potato beginner starts w 10 minutes a day and gradually works up to 30 minutes a day also not an information overload for a beginner \) and walking magazine the complete guide to walking for health , fitness , and weight loss by mark fenton \( this is the one i'm using now great walking program schedule and tons of very good info on keeping variety in your fitness routine \) if you can afford them , get all three \( i also like the sprited walker by who i forget , for motivation \) if not , start w the the 90 day fitness walking program by mark fenton and maybe this prevention one to get you additionally fired up
i am the author of this book i do n't recieve any royalties for its sales and i no longer work for prevention magazine or rodale inc i 've checked here from time to time to see if the reviews change the single negative review on top has been up for years i think it 's too bad i know many people have thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it very very helpful it 's true that much of it is a compilation of many years of articles written for prevention and for my newsletter but they were well researched , facthecked and contain lots of helpful info for all levels of walkers the section on dynamic walking is one of kind you wo n't find that information anywhere else i think it 's a shame that one bad review by a person who seems mostly interested in marathons can be in place for years and put people off from getting a book that could really motivate them to walk for health for a lifetime if you 're new to walking and or a beginner looking for solid advice and inspiration , this book wo n't disappoint you there , i 've said my peace now my two bits will be up here for years my friends will probably tease the heck out of me for defending my work so be it !
this first novel by one of modern america 's prose writing treasures is set in a part of california no one associates with the golden state the sacramento delta the emotional and physical geography of the book blend seamlessly didion has since critiqued this book herself , in her much later prose reflection on california , where i was from she 's a bit hard on her former self this is a lucid , hard etched short novel on the same general theme as tolstoi 's anna karenina that is , how a uniquely unhappy family got that way didion is of an old california family she takes no false pride in that , here or elsewhere there is not a useless or spongy sentence in the whole book writers will be reminded of what they 're supposed to be doing when they pick up a pen
great book ! just letting people who are interested know that they can purchase it online at www drfuhrman com , since it is currently unavailable here as a testment to this way of eating , i can say that it works wonders and should you buy it and follow dr f 's suggestions , be rest assured that your cholesterol will return to a normal range right now i can tell you that dr fuhrman recommends eating large amounts of vegetables , esp green ones like kale , spinach , bok choy , broccoli , brussel sprouts and lettuce , as well as fruits , and small amounts of beans , nuts and seeds if this does not sound appealing to you , i would definitely give it a shot anyway it is not as if you will be eating these foods on their own dr f provides delicious recipes in the book and has many more delicious ones on his website also , this is your health we are talking about i think it would be worth trying new or unfamiliar foods in the quest to regain your health also , as a follower of dr f myself , i would like to say that he has mentioned that taste buds can actually change over time i am learning that in myself now i used to despise brussel sprouts and now i am not repulsed and will eat them on occasion quite a shocker , i know but if you are a skeptic , read dr f 's books , try his diet and then tell me i am wrong
i purchased this book for my dad when he discovered his cholesterol and blood pressure were a little high i tried to find a lifestyle book rather than a recipe book this has some great recipe ideas , but is more focused on trading in bad habits for good ones my recently retired father ca n't keep his hands out of this book he loves it
this book is available at fuhrman 's website for 14 95 i have no idea why anyone is trying to rip people off by asking 90 dollars for a copy ! good grief you can buy a hardcover , signed by the dr , for 25 bucks i only hope this absurd price is a typo
excellent book written to given alternatives to taking the normal cholesteral lowering drugs he is very motivational , informative yet balanced in his view i just got my blood test back and my cholesterol has lowered by 99 points he also gives lots of ideas on things to eat that are helpfu
i had already read and been persuaded by dr fuhrman 's main book , eat to live , that better health for many americans was possible , and that dr fuhrman was showing the way cholesterol protection for life is a much shorter book , it is more tightly focused \( on heart disease , rather than general health \) , and it has a stronger impact at least , it did for me i thought my diet had already become very healthy , but cpl showed me there was work yet to be done , and that it is worthwhile to do it
i found this book so easy to read and understand it is a lifesaver if you are suffering from high cholesterol levels or heart disease or if you want to ensure you never do ! dr fuhrman gives you delicious recipes and easy to follow nutritional advice he also tells you exactly what supplements to take if needed there really are other options besides statin drugs and their unwanted side effects it is sad that more doctors do n't give advice and information like this to their patients i admire dr fuhrman so much for the tireless effort he puts into helping us learn ways to cure illness and live longer , healthier lives this book gives you the knowledge you need to find your own way back to a healthy life free from drugs and heart disease
do n't believe anybody who says aggressive nutritional therapy ca n't work miracles it can ! if you 've been told that you need to take cholesterol lowering medications for the rest of your life , even if you have already tried dietary intervention , read cholesterol protection for life \( cpfl \) you have the right to know that there is an effective option besides statin drugs your doctor probably has not mentioned it the patients of the author , dr joel fuhrman , routinely see their cholesterol plummet within weeks of adopting the eating style outlined in cpfl and expanded upon in the mother volume , eat to live \( etl \)
this book provides a very useful guide in order to understand the basic theory about investments the only one thing that the writer of this book must do is to add is more demonstration problems
there should be no typos in a 9th edition but go ahead and count them not just in the text , but problems as well there are times when formulas in the body of chapters are wrong or other times when you do n't have all the info needed to answer one of the problems universities and instructors should be ashamed of themselves for making you spend 120 on this
avi shlaim is a rare authority of the kind who honestly portrays the truth he meticulously unravelled the knots in history and came out with the true events that shaped israel and its relation towards arabs since 1948 he deconstructed the history by analyzing many documents and showed how the and why the israeli leaders behaved and reacted to scenarios , how was their interrelation , how they perceived the security facts and what was their relation to the military commanders i was looking for this kind of book for long and finally found it in tanya reinhert 's book \( see my review on this book \) he showed that how true is kissinger 's aphorism about israel is true israel has no foreign policy , it has only domestic politics it was so true although he showed that usa has rather balanced policy toward israel , at least till the 1990s , but from a lay person 's perspective thats hardly the case how come israel has so many f16s and pakistan had to burgain for years to buy f16s ! anyway this book was very educative for me , it helped me to learn objectively about the arab israel conflict , and thus to counter the stereotypes of many of my egyptian friends , for example
while the pro zionist lobby \( i know them well , being a sabra \) will attempt to shred any book that does n't present israel as an angel and the arab world as devils , this is a fair book and will fill a good chunk of the white space in anyone 's knowledge of the region the author attempts to explain how one founding principle determined the behavior of israel 's dominant leaders over the decades , and he succeeds the author 's conclusion is that jabotinsky had a workable and realistic theory \( build the figurative iron wall , then negotiate for peace \) , but that many of israel 's leaders did not have the qualities necessary to complete the second part of that theory the author does a good job of examining these leaders , delving into what made them tick and how that affected policy rabin was one leader who might have made jabotinsky 's theory work , as the author shows , but he did not survive the jewish right wing
avi shlaim has done an outstanding job of presenting the brief history of zionism and the formation of the state of israel although he tends to editorialize his own perception of history , dr shlaim , nevertheless , remains true to the facts
the subtext of this book is that israel is an imperial power that has historically orchestrated its foreign and domestic policies to subjugate the arab 'nations' on its borders if one agrees with this thesis uncritically then the book will be a satisfying self indulgent read however , to be fair , even you dismiss this oversimplified analysis , the book is still worth reading to gather an insight into revisionist thinking
shlaim tries to tell the truth about the conflict that is being inflicted in palestine and the isralei territories he identifies the faults in israel 's policies and points out israel 's stubborness at achieving peace he enlightens readers and angers zionists , who are self deluded by a belief that there cause is just he uncovers the horrorific circumstances inflicted on palestinians , some which match that of south africa 's former apartheid shlaim has the courage and strength to produce the truth in a conflict that is riddled with so many lies
avi shlaim is in the school of what are called the new historians on the arab israeli conflict , along with benny morris who broke new ground in historical analysis with the birth of the palestinian refugee problem this text by shlaim is a great single volume overview of the history of the conflict , from 1948 and the war of independence leading all the way up to 1999 the thesis of his book is that the zionist movement eventually adopted the political philosophy of ze'ev jabotinksy with his ideas on revisionist zionism , his argument being that the zionists must build up and iron wall in the middle east to create the state of israel , with the intention of allowing the arabs in after they give up the fight essentially it 's an ideology that breaks down as the best defense is a good offense and shlaim makes a compelling case in his book , doing so as objectively as he can he traces the origins of the first arab war , the suez war , the june 1967 war , the yom kippur war , and so on , leading up to the collision with the palestinians and the still going occupation the flaw in this text is that while shlaim is able to draw on a wealth of primary israeli sources \( providing an excellent bibliography \) , he is unable to reveal arab planning as he cites very few arab sources i do n't pretend to know the truth about this conflict there probably will not be an objective account on this for another 100 years for all i know however , i think shlaim is done an excellent job reviewing israel 's history and political policies in the arab world , and anyone who is new to this topic should start here
some reviews of shlaim 's iron wall suggest incorrectly that it explains the roots of arab jewish conflict over palestine in fact the book offers only a 27 page prologue , insightful and well written but largely based on secondary and tertiary sources and far too limited in scope so far the best work on this topic remains the somewhat formal and pedantic first 129 pages of kimmerling 's and migdal 's palestinian people shlaim 's book provides notably concise summaries , so effective that the first one or two pages of each chapter provide enough information for a first reading of the book
let me start by advising that this is a dry book to read , so it is not for the average reader of narrative history but its meticulous scholarship makes it an indispensable book about affairs in the middle east
in this excellent book , shlaim brought up to the spotlight what has been one of the most confusing , disputed history of any country of the world , that of israel
ram charan makes a complex topic easy to understand this book can be speed read in 45 minutes and it does n't make you feel dizzy ram charan is a true thought leader and an inspiration
feisty fido presents a clear step by step method for changing the behavior of a dog who is aggressive toward strange dogs when he is being walked on leash it was not as clear on changing the behavior of a dog who is intermittently agressive toward other dogs he lives with
this book is primarily for dogs aggressive on leash , same dogs off leash are fine with most , if not all , other dogs it is only one of 28 catagories of aggression or combination thereof the benefit to getting this booklet is that 1 \) you can determine if this is really the problem before you invest in a lot of more expensive books that deal with all manner of aggression and 2 \) you should be working with a trainer on any kind of aggression issue this booklet will help you to know what type of methods are likely to be effective and you will have something to refer to as you are working with the trainer i would not work with anyone who is not familiar and endorses at least some of mcconnell 's positive training recommendations
this book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then i personally ca n't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then it goes over desentization \( not rocket science \) but does n't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues i'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory it 's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it 's puppy ness or real aggression concerns
highly recommended especially if you have rescued a dog !
i heard pat speak on the subject of dog agression last year at the pet dog trainers assocaition this book fills out the notes from that session an incredible assest for trainers dealing with all levels of agression in dogs i have used the methods with good sucesson three client cases reading this gives trainers more options for dealing with feisty fido 's that show up with unhappy owners
aside from people who just plain hate shakespeare \( and i do n't get them at all \) , there are two types of shakespeare snobs 1 the ones who think shakespeare could n't have written his plays because he was n't born to nobility these people are idiots 2 the ones who idolize shakespeare to the point where , if they do n't like one of his plays , he obviously could n't have written it he is incapable of writing something they do n't like um right let 's apply this rationale to a latter day artist since charlie chaplin made the gold rush , he obviously had nothing to do with a king in new york

those of us who have kept up with this series will be both amused and touched by the birth of mavis' baby the ending brings a tear or two especially if you have gone thru the 'process' eve and roarke 's reactions are downright funny and right on and the concept of male birth control pills is a forever dream of mine in my field of abuse counselling !
it is simply unbearable to put this book down the character development is completely captivating and the humor of eve and roarke regarding childbirth cannot but to keep the reader chuckling great thriller and great story outside the thriller a masterpiece inside a masterpiece i will say no more as to do so would ruin the pleasure of reading born in death and that would be an unspeakable crime
this was of course a good read , as most all of the 'in death' books are i very much liked the two mysteries that eve had to solve \( the murders and the missing person \) so glad mavis finally had her baby not a lot of character development when will something different happen to eve and roarke \? we need a bit of a toss up with them i am a loyal fan and will wait eagerly for the next one
i was really looking forward to this one because of mavis having her baby nora roberts aka j d robb did n't disappoint roake and dallas both acted exactly as expected , with horror at the idea of being a part of the birth dallas and roake both can wade through blood and guts but heaven forbid they deal with a baby being born it was funny and on the mark i enjoy nora roberts books and always look forward to the next one
i own the single books from dini ross teamup great books they capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale nothing to add about the art ross is well known and always getting better and better , with panels as evocative as the prose the hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces \( even if a bit heavy to handle \) but if you are looking for extra material \( as the new edition of mythology \) you could be disappointed
actually , this edition is more a 7 and a half stars worth of material the writing , which is both accesible to children as to adults , tells the very human stories of legendary dc universe heroes like superman , batman and wonder woman among others trying to make the world a better place in their own respective ways
based on the strength of the kingdom come graphic novel illustrated gorgeously by alex ross , i picked up this gem of story telling the chapters contained within the book are treasures of narrative that will keep one 's attention without any trouble at all i am a fan of the x men from 'that other comic book company' but i get too caught up in the megalomania of those stories that i realized how much i saw that superheroes dealing with common criminals and situations are as much , if not more , compelling
this book reprints 6 special comics and does them justice alex ross 's art not only looks great , but tells the story well the pretty pictures do not get in the way of the story the book is smaller size than the originals , which were the size of the old life magazine , but the art is not impaired in the least and the production values are top of the line what makes the book worth having , though , are not the pretty pictures but the stories paul dini writes stories which make each of the characters examine themselves , bringing us along in a thoroughly entertaining manner he makes them very human , complemented by the art which is very lifelike \( ross uses human models \) the batman story is the best , the justice league story the weakest , although that is a relative judgement since it is a pretty good story at the time the stories were first published , i had wished that the 5th volume would be a plastic man story and still feel that would have been a better way to go , but such was not to be regardless , this book will remind you why we love superheroes
this fantastic volume comprises all the seperate treasury size comics produced by ross and dini these wonderful tales feature the breathtaking art of alex ross , and the stories themselves focus essentially on the iconaclastic elements of the individual characters the motivations of batman , superman , wonde woman , etc , are revealved to the reader without the mess of having to adhere to the rigid soap opera continuity that is the focus of modern era comics these are simply great stories accompanied by great art in a sense , what comics should be
if you are into super heroes and those specifically related to dc , this is a must have book the quality of the illustrations is worth every penny
i have been an avid superhero fan since a child i have read many comics , both good and bad this collection of dc stories is by far the most visually appealing not only is the art work of alex ross incredible , but the story telling is phenomenal as well
whether you 're new to the dc universe or a diehard fan from yesteryear , there is something in this amazing collection sure to delight you intelligent stories with well written dialogue reverence to the history of the iconic characters and breathtaking art what a superb collectible and a bonus that proceeds go to the very charitable organizations the justice league members themselves would endorse !
i love dc 's absolute format , especially how it lovingly showcases the body of work contained within it is grand to have this on the bookshelf and it 's contents are indeed something to behold the only reason i did n't give this edition a perfect score is that i wish this omnibus also included both the two page robin origin and the short batman superman story which were originally published in ross' mythology book their absence really stings since they were crafted to fit in perfectly with the material of this collected edition
alex ross is an american treasure he brings a visual reality to our mythology this collection of work is an incredible bargain , and something any fan of either his work or the subject matter \( the heros of dc comics' pantheon \) will treasure for a lifetime
one of the best thriller writers brings back one of my favorite protagonists , mitch rapp a character that knows how to get things done sure he does it outside the guidelines , and with great vigor , but that 's what makes him a rare treat an enthralling story , with very satisfying thrills and outcomes
in an era when some american citizens openly root for the nation 's enemies , vince flynn 's mitch rapp character is a refreshing throwback to another era where no american would openly criticize his nation during time of war before , yes after , yes but not during
since i do n't normally write reviews , i 'll not try to make this clever i was completely disappointed in this latest attempt from vince flynn though i love the character of mitch rapp , in this novel he read like a cardboard cut out of the mitch rapp in all previous books as i read , i tried to analyze what was going on well , he just been through a big loss , very traumatic flynn is trying to show the audience that mitch has been profoundly altered by the experience flynn will deal with this head on at some point in the novel he never does the whole interaction between kennedy and rapp at the end of the book feels like it was written by an 7th grader its out of character and unbelievable for two seasoned intelligence professionals , completely without subtlety i 've now come to the conclusion that , as a writer , flynn has lost the hunger \( i e is too full of himself , now that he 's made it and has friends in high places \) my husband is a writer , i know the difference between when he 's producing junk and when he 's in the creative zone , writer coming together with words , not satisied until he 's melded creative energy to insight , to produce art it appears that flynn hurried threw this together a great disappointment to his fans who have followed mitch since term limits and connected with his ability to read a situation , act decisively and remain in control , objectives intact i 've already sold this book \( though i wo n't part with the others \) and i 'll be more careful before i buy flynn 's next offering my advice to vince remember why you started writing \( i 'll bet it was n't to produce books of mediocity \)
another close presidential election draws near the democrats are falling behind in the polls and running mates alexander and ross are pulling out all the campaign stops to close the gap in the polls
when i read a novel i try to see how quickly i can figure out what will happen next it was very easy to do with this novel there is one surprise in the end that i did not anticipate nevertheless i liked this book very much it is a good escape for a few hours '24' watchers will like this novel mitch rapp is the novel equivilent of jack bauer i also believe that vince flynn is giving us some idea how the cia really works and because of the times we live in i do n't think it is too much of a stretch to see this novel as an education in what is happening today with the fbi and cia but do n't forget this is a novel ! !
my favorite vince flynn book is still term limits , but i really enjoyed act of treason and am anxiously awaiting mr flynn 's next mitch rapp novel highly recommended
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer , imho it has romance , treasure hunting , and a little magic really great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down i read it several years ago
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters , and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep sea diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed , maybe because i did not want it to end ! also , i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state , the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree , the blue green water , the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read , however i am an avid jd robb reader
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her , it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet , romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book , whether you like romance novels or not
first , let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books , more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read , her stories tend to be very formulaic , and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's , for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before , my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books , this one went against convention in many ways , while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship , but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain , but the love story was touching as other readers have said , i liked how she spread it out over the years , which made it slightly more realistic , and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short , if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan , give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered , but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men , and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream
last man standing is about a fbi agent named web london in a division called hrt or hostage rescue team he is a grizzled veteran in the department that somehow avoided being killed with his comrades and friends in a ambush style killing in dc accused of cowardice in a now scandalized department , a now disenfranchised and disillusioned web london sets down a path to clear his name that at a point branches off into 3 separate stories before converging back into one in a highly dramatic and well written novel i never read anything by david baldacci before last man standing however after finishing the book it leaves me wanting to read more from him it is truly a book that you will not want to put down
i was looking for a real thriller , and thought i would try one by david baldacci i had read a very favourable review a while back , and i have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of absolute power
i have read baldacci 's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them this one , however , is just awful not only the character 's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows , with lame lines like the gun was loaded , and so was i that is exactly what this book is like , except it goes on for 400 pages there is n't a single interesting character in this book , in my opinion you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end it 's the bataan death march of novels i hope this is an aberration i 'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good but one more stinker like this one and i 'll drop his name from my reading list
in this involving and complicated story , david baldacci covers everything from drug dealing , to cults , to the fbi , to pyschoanalyis and hypnotism there 's also a horse farm and pornography thrown in for good measure ! the main plot deals with the character of web london , the sole survivor of a botched mission by hrt \( hostage rescue team \) , a part of the fbi as he and his companions are en route to tackle a drug lord , london suddenly collapses , unable to continue , as if paralyzed he then is forced to witness his colleagues' massacre as they are shot by remote control weaponry as they enter an urban courtyard london 's determination to discover what happened to him and clear his name makes up the bulk of the novel in his journey , he is forced to confront childhood abuse , and the possible abuse of his psychiatrist baldacci tells the story from several points of view , and should be credited with creating complex and compelling characters who are both heroic and flawed on the good side , this helps when the plot becomes increasingly complicated on the potentially bad side , the characters are , not surprisingly , unhappy with their lives , and there 's not a `happy' ending for most of them the pain gets a little much at times , even though the `good' guys win at the end the end is abrupt , and leaves you wondering if you missed something worth reading , just concentrate on the plot , or it will get away from you
what a waste of time this book is good for one thing it reminded of something i need to work on my stubbornness sometimes i can be just too stubborn for my own good when i was reading this i just would n't quit and had to go all the way to the end this will teach me thank you mr baldacci !
i religiously read all of baldacci 's books he ca n't write them fast enough for me and this is one of his best ! i 'd give it 10 stars if i could
really fun to read , great pace and highly entertaining the thrilling and complex story has great characters and ample twists and turns i stayed awake for long hours to read the book and the story kept me guessing until the very end
my first baldacci book , which lead me to read all of his books action packed mystery awesome
i found this book to repetitive it just keeps going on and on , on how bad web feels about the death of his 7 team mates also , it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that do n't really add to the story at all it just adds to the stereotype of how life is in annacostia , washington dc one such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid she is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements i do n't recommend this book at all , but if you are a narrow minded white male , who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest , this book is for you
i have a 60 minute drive to and from work every day so i read countless books on cd mostly , i listen to these books to stay awake so i'm always looking for something fast and exciting that i do n't have to think hard to comprehend at 5 30 am this book was the perfect fit the characters are developed , but not too deeply where it 's confusing who is who , etc unlike other thrillers that i 've read , you really begin rooting for the main character because of the opening scene big f is a great character too that always keeps you guessing
overall , star wars rpg is a good system its very easy to learn if you 've played d20 modern especially i would n't say that there are any big problems with the game system , but there are certainly a lot of minor problems that would be very confusing frustrating to someone without a rules lawyer who understands game balancing its a fun game for roleplaying , but i'm not sure wizards had any really competant game balancing rules lawyers actually look over the system , or maybe they did n't play test it enough either way , the system has a number of very minor game unbalancing things that spring up in game from time to time that require a comptetant gm to resolve nothing especially terrible , and overall i enjoy the system as do many of the people i play with so i would recommend the system to any star wars and roleplaying enthusiasts \( in that order \)
if your thinking of buying this , then do this book has provided many hours of fun just reading it , let alone playing star wars rpg
the 2002 version of the star wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original it upgrades some underpowered character classes , adds some breadth , and makes much needed improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook unfortunately , the central , crippling problem with the 1999 version remains the d20 system just is n't well suited to star wars storytelling playing this game is nothing like playing out a star wars story , and a lot like playing dungeons and dragons in space
the revised core rules fixed much of what was wrong with the old core rulebook the classes \( and prestige classes \) are much better more flexibility for dark side pc 's is available skills and feats make more sense and are n't nearly as munchkined as they were before
i'm glad that i picked it up , a much better volume than the first book for this game glad they made it available
the item i received from this person came quickly and was of high quality i am quite pleased with this purchase kudos
the star wars universe is really good and when put together with the d20 rpg system it is phenominal i have played dnd and i have found it hard to get sometimes , but with the star wars rpg there is no limit to what you can do if you are going to play any d20 rpg , i recommend that you take a look at this on
this latest edition of the star wars roleplaying system is the best one that has been released to date first of all , i have to say that i'm really pleased with the full color format there 's a nice mix of scenes from the movie and original artwork as for the system , it is based on the d20 system , and it is quite easy to learn , especially if you are familiar with other d20 systems another great plus is that this book is a complete package in other words you can start playing with just this book i was really pleased with that because a lot of systems will make you buy a player 's book for character creation and another for gamemastering of course there are lots of other books that will help you add detail to your campaigns , but if you 're short on cash , do n't worry this one will be enough to get you started check it out , and make the world of star wars come alive
i am a veteren d d player and friend recently introduced me to swrpg overall swrpg is a very good game but is slightly similer to 3rd edition d d with blasters instead of swords and the force instead of magic however there are many deeper changes that really make it feel like star wars and both rpg veterans and new players will have a lot of fun with it
rachel ray is becoming
well you know the rest aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired these meals cannot be done in 30 minutes , unless that is if you want everything half cooked the book makes false promises and does not deliver there are also no pictures and no index and the recipes are very confusing most of them deriving from an original master recipe and then just changing one or two things if you want good food and a good cook book do n't buy into the hype and do n't buy this book
this cookbook definitely makes for good reading it 's done in a conversational style like her show is kind of humorous when they have to include a section about what evoo is and what it means to let food hang out
i 've heard a lot about ms ray 's show on the food network , so i thought this book might be an interesting addition to my library i was wrong unfortunately i did n't scan the book before buying it , or else it would still be on the shelf most of my gripes have been covered now that i have read them un organized , no index , and to be honest , uninspiring recepies 30 minute meals \? i do n't think so given the time it takes to find what 's needed to create a meal , most of them seem to be the kind that were passed down by word of mouth , and not researched is ms ray a chef \? i do n't think so , and am not sure what her credentials actually are
i love this cookbook i received it in college as a christmas gift and it had plenty of inexpensive and yummy recipes i love the various pasta recipes and the take out recipes the best and i 've used them again and again
good book for beginners and for those who have reached a place of discovery , but much too repetitious for me do n't listen to the audio while driving as tolles voice is a monotone
this is the book i recommend and give to people as an introduction to spiritual life
i bought this audio book based on a recommendation i knew very little about it when i bought it and started listening to it i found it fascinating , although a bit repetitive the core concepts were for the most part engaging , and i like that it was read by the author i was surprised by the q a format , but got used to it fairly quickly i find the background of the author very interesting
a book full of deep insight and potential for revolutionary change both in my life and the world i found it helpful to reread the book several times , absorbing more each time
just the sound of his voice as he reads the text is like an iv drip for the soul i cannot say enough about the power of this message everyone should listen to this message
this book is a radical wisdom teaching the premise is simple that the only reality is to be found in the present moment , but the realization of this changes the way we look at and react with the world i 've read the book twice once to understand what he 's talking about , and again to see how to apply it i have given it to several friends the best thing about the book is the question and answer format , which deals with most of the problems that come up i also liked the references to buddhism and christianity the book is especially valuable for people who deal with depression and or anxiety a lot of the reviews of this book are negative as tolle points out , the ego has a lot invested in its survival
this powerful book will help you focus on the importance of living in the present and prioritizing issues it is a resource for all people , of all religions and spiritual beliefs it will provide you support to help you through a crisis it is a tool to be shared with family and friends
this book has contributed to my understanding of living in the present moment more than anything else i 've read in fact i 've read it several times and plan on reading it again highly recommended to anyone seeking higher consciousness
as someone who has always appreciated and been intrigued by the different religions of the world and the similarities between them , i love how this book makes them all relevant to my life how i live it one thing that most impresses me about this book is the author 's thoroughness and conviction in the power of now , tolle basically describes the essence of being what it is to be in the now , and what it is n't he successfully does this by addressing the major life forces that affect our ability to be present the mind , the body , death , time , space , etc without straying from the heart of the book his knowledge , appreciation and respect for so many of the ancient spiritual teachings , from jesus , the bible , zen , buddhism , taoism , and more , is enlightening in itself and supports his message very effectively although i did n't agree with every concept in the book , i appreciate the thoughtfulness and compassion with which each is presented tolle is a true spiritual teacher who has much to offer in the practice of self discovery
previous to the first reading of this book , the principles of present moment living , quieting the mind , and being still to become in touch with my intuition or the wisdom of the universe are some i have practiced , along with others , that have enabled me to experience serenity in my life regardless of the circumstances though many of the concepts of this book were not new to me , i find this book very valuable it further expands the understanding of these concepts and adds its own voice to the discussion of these principles with great clarity it is a book i have read many times and each time , though i may just read a page or two , it quiets my mind and i feel more peaceful \( in my second reading , it helped me to be more peaceful during a time when the doctors believed my son had an inoperable brain tumor \) i have since moved on to read his next book a new earth and i am on my third reading i highly recommend this one as well
i have n't had so much fun in a long time i wanted to go up and down the river with this one i found it interesting and challenging too good book
a classic military treatise used for twenty five centuries shows the way to a success over life 's obstacles presented in an engaging , rousing , and sensible way the manual is very well organized and a must have
i read the art of war years ago and the it was a good book once you got around the fluff this book is short , and to the point with a new twist for every day life
more like a workbook , we admire the way this book breaks away from the usual war mode and into the strategy realm sun tzu , though it does show you how to prepare for battle , prefers that war is not implemented if not for preservation 's sake this book 's print quality could be better but it is very well organized with profound analyses broken down verse by verse and separated by each area of interaction \( personal , interpersonal , group \) you can tell the author really took the effort to have the reader understand and apply every concept wow you 'll be glad you bought it sonshi co
i have read numerous translations of the art of war , however the art of strategy takes the classic chinese strategy to a level that modern americans can easily relate i use this version of the book in a course taught on public relations strategy and it is always well received by the students it seems to be less militaristic in its presentation and more applicable to modern problems including those of a more personal nature while i personally prefer thomas cleary 's translation , there is no question that my students get much out of wing 's new twist great book
practical , sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up , the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it 's extremely dry the author 's writing is much more engaging in his followup , and that 's a much faster read
the sub header to this book could very well be all work no play makes jack a dull boy
while this book is rather dry at parts , if you 're truly interested in making the most of your money , you 'll benefit from its insight there are several things i keep in the back of my mind whenever i'm tempted to overspend most millionaires drive regular cars , not new , fancy ones and most do n't live extravagantly , they work hard , spend wisely and let the majority of their money grow essentially , most millionaires live like middle class folk , they just know how to live within their means
the basic premise after all the wash is done , is that those who are what the authors refer to as 'prodigious accumulators of wealth \( paws \) ' have figured out the difference between what they want and what they need that they are n't sucked into the consumerism machine that the marketing hypnotists attempt to impose upon us and that they understand that there 's more than one way to get the things that they need , which often involves innovation , barter , and yes a little effort
i guess that when you think of millionaires , you think of flashy people with nice cars and a lot of bling , but i had no idea that there were so many boring millionaires ! i guess it 's not really pboring to have over a million dollars , but i want to be able to enjoy my monye theat 's the purpose of this book , though to show that you have to be boring and then you can get to be a millionaire with all the money you did n't spend on fun stuff ! i almost fell asleep a couple times reading this , but when i stayed awake it was really eye opening i wo n't scoff at those people who do n't have big hats but have a lot of cattle anymore
this book was interesting at first it shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like , but that only takes a chapter after that , it just keeps repeating itself over and over who do you think bought the 1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch \? yeah , yeah , i get it the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending , no real wealth guy
i read this book many , many years ago on a very long flight i could n't put it down the philosophy is simple live frugally , save invest money every month , and you too can be a millionaire it 's great advice , especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house , expensive car , and everything else right now , with no regard to the future although some of the info is dated \( enron being named as a great company to invest \) , and some other advice \( putting new soles on old shoes \) is a bit much , the general message makes plenty of sense
rent interesting most authentic in the collins part
the music is great , as well as the songs that are in the book it 's not challenging for the piano , so anyone can easily learn to play it
overall i am pretty pleased with this selection of numbers from rent , the best show to ever hit broadway i was a little bummed that only 12 numbers managed to make it 's way to this book , especially because some of them work and some of them do n't
the music from rent is so powerful this book has a good number of the major songs the music is not too hard to learn and the arrangements do n't sound sparce definetely a good buy for any piano playing rent fan
the essence of rent was absolutely captured in this vocal selections book , with great songs such as one song glory , another day no day but today , and your eyes , included , however i was disappointed to see that songs such as over the moon , and my personal favorite la vie boheme were not included guitar chords above measures in the music make easy for a non piano expert such as myself to play the songs and sing along now this is not an original broadway score , and some songs sound awkward on the piano , but once a person is set with just sitting down at the piano to have fun playing their favorite rent songs , this book is perfect
the selections in this collection match the selections featured on the rent selections album unfortunately , this means that many of the best songs in the full score are cut out \( including light my candle , la vie boheme i should tell you , etc \) , because they involve sung dialogue rather than liftable songs \( songs that work out of context \) another drawback is that in general , songs written for a rock band \( featuring extensive guitar \) do not transcribe well to solo piano \( guitar chords are included in this book , though \) with this in mind , however , there is still a lot of good things about this collection larson 's great ballad esque songs , like i 'll cover you , your eyes , without you , and seasons of love work very well as piano vocal other , more rock sounding songs such as rent , out tonight , and what you own are still doable as written they may sound a little awkward , but people who have had experience playing rock piano may find that with a little fiddling with the written notes a decent version can be produced even if you do n't have experience playing rock piano , if you have more experience playing other broadway music you can still learn a lot from working with these songs and trying out different things other songs included are take me or leave me , another day , halloween , and santa fe take me did n't transcribe well \( esp the vocal line \) due to the bluesy pitches of the song , but the main riff and the chords are accurate another day contains both the rock elements and the balladesque elements , but the rock elements do not require many changes halloween transcribes faithfully and works well santa fe is transcribed well , but since much of it is spoken it is also a little odd overall this book is well done the songs are all faithful in spirit to the album , although at times a pitch is written differently from the orig broadway cast recording the song where this is most apparent is in seasons of love where it appears that the two soloists' lines were mostly improvised although i usually prefer for a song 's accompaniment to reflect the actual full score , in the case of these songs such accompaniment is repetitive and adding the vocal line \( which is actually a very standard practice for vocal selections \) was very welcome rent has become a part of the modern musical theater canon , and so this book has become necessary for any broadway lover 's sheet music collection
sheer brilliance you have to hear it and read it to understand
it took me a while to learn to play any of these songs on my guitar and they sound awesome it was one of my dreams to play songs such as one song glory and others my dreams it to be rojer in the broadway play for rent and this is getting me evercloser to my dream the music is challenging and quite long also once you learn the song on one instrument it sounds sort of strange but if you have other people playing with you and a singer it sounds exactly like the show this book is awesome definately worth the money ! so buy it
one of the classic disney movies i remembered was the alice 's adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll reading this novel gave me the same feelings i had in my childhood years watching the movie i could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie alice was reading her sister 's book and fell asleep under a tree then she woke up , saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking she then followed the rabbit into this hole after that she was in a never ending tunnel , which lead her to a strange world alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them
in the book alice 's adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll a young girl with the name of alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her the book starts off with alice in the park with her sister she has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by , she does n't hesitate to follow it following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of this book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of through the use of carroll 's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride i thought that the book was very well written and very interesting i could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how alice would have felt i would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way this book is for children and adults alike as long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world
when i was eight years old , this version of alice in wonderland was aired on t v i thought i had watched the best movie ever at that time , and still , to this day , i have more fond memories of watching that movie than any other time in my life ! the songs were beautiful ! i can still sing the song alice sang to the deer why do people act as if they 're crazy \? why to they behave the way they do \? i have to say , this is one my favorite songs of all time !
i loved this as a child it used to be on tv a lot and i remember begging my mother to tape it on vhs we recorded it one day and i watched it so much the vhs broke i am now 20 and my boyfriend recently purchased this dvd plus through the looking glass from some idiot on here and his copies were worse than mine he claimed they were new but we got them and they were opened mass produced copies we could tell because the vhs's were blank and the covers were not original please release these movies on dvd !
i was just 2 years old when this movie came out , but my grandfather taped it for me on beta when i was about 3 i started watching the beta tape let 's just say i drove my family crazy with this movie ! i watched it in its entirety every day i memorized every single line i definitely recommend this movie to everyone ! ! i now have it on vhs , but am praying one day it will go to dvd because when i have kids some day i would like them to be able to enjoy this movie it 's a fun family movie it has an all star cast and is very enjoyable ! ! i definitely think you all should watch it
i first viewed this version when it came out in 1985 i was enthralled by it then and still love it today \( i have a well worn vhs copy from the tv \) it brings the story to life in a way that no other attempts have achieved
this is an abridged version of alice in wonderland the story does not suffer , since much of the omitted material is not essential
i agree with the reviews already posted this is the only alice in wonderland movie in my opinion as children my sister and i would watch it all the time from a video taped from the television years later i saw it in a video store and had to buy it even though it was n't on dvd i still have my copies but am waiting patiently for them to be released on dvd
this production of alice in wonderland is pretty fabulous i loved it as a child it has a lovely mix of classic stars \( sammy davis junior , imogene coca \) and flavors of the month from the mid 80s \( pat morita , john stamos \) it would make a great dvd set
back in the 80 's when i was about 7 or 8 years old , this 2 part movie came on tv and we recorded it , of course it was on beta back then i totally fell in love with this movie after i only saw it once or twice , i was n't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and tv never showed it so i was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90 's , like 98 or 99 , i just happened to look in the disney store and saw both alice in wonderland \( 1985 \) and alice through the looking glass \( 1985 \) and i bought them right away they were on vhs but it does n't really matter because i love them so much to this day , at 27 years old , i still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it

isolated , brooding hill house is reputed to be haunted one summer , four people gather there to investigate dr montague wants to prove the existence of hauntings scientifically lovely theodora needs a place to stay for the summer luke , the dashing young heir to the house , is supposed to keep an eye on the estate for his aunt and eleanor has been waiting all her life for something to happen something like hill house
this book is a short read the pace and prose is circa 1959 , but it fits this story very well it is the quintessential haunted house book and offers plenty of creepy moments , always subtle and handled with care , more psychodynamic than cheap surprises or thrills if you 're looking for blood and guts or chase scenes this is not the book it ended a bit abruptly and i was not satisfied with the ending for eleanor , felt a little cheated in the end great book
a classic example of horror that does not rely on pornographic gore and shock value for its chill factor of the two movies that have been adapted from this book , the 1963 black and white version is a greater achievement of film making , while the 1999 version is more visually stunning neither movie , however , can quite contain how weird and wonderful this book is shirley jackson , queen of the not quite sane heroine , unfolds a quietly disturbing piece that makes the reader question how much of the weirdness is external and how much of it is inside the narrator 's head excellent companion piece for we have always lived in the castle , which puts a different spin on the same unreliable narrator technique
this is one of my favorite books definately the best haunted house story i ever came across one of only a handful of books i 've reread
the haunting of hill house has to be one of the best written books i have ever read the prose alone makes it recommendable reading it is clean , economical and yet certainly artistic the story is compelling and keeps you interested all the way through
okay , i went into this book after seeing the remake of haunting of house hill i 've never seen the original and can only pray that it does more justice to the book
i grew up in a big old victorian house a lot like hill house , and one day when i was about 12 years old , and my folks were gone , i started reading the haunting of hill house
the story haunting of hill house has great examples of people changing just to fit in although the haunting of hill house fits this description perfectly with its eerie description of supernatural tales of the happenings of hill house there is more to it than hauntings the story starts out with three guests being invited to the house to monitor any out of the ordinary occurrences in hill house throughout the story the guests experience some ghostly moments however during this , one of the guest named eleanor changes her ways to fit in with the guests one example would be when eleanor told lies about herself and her past , and when eleanor went around the house alone having no fear finally eleanor became open and spoke out what was on her mind
there 's nothing like a good ghost story ! and this is a superb ghost story it is so incredibly frightening because it is so subtle and believeable it seems like it 's almost possible that something like that could happen , although i personally do n't feel that ghosts are evil
this book contains a lot of useful information for the new teacher or the burned out teacher who needs a boost it 's useful in the sense that it tries to get teachers to stop taking negative beahvior personally \( usually it 's not about the teacher \) and to use positive reinforcement as much as possible always a good idea whenever you are trying to change behavior , be it animal or human ! but i had to laugh out loud when the author suggests praising the consistently tardy student for being in class most of the time give me a break !
i wish mr sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels that flow and voice i understood so well at first sight felt like i was reading a deadline novel just words , no insight , did n't make this reader think at all sorry , just the way i read it
i loved this book ! another great book written by nicholas sparks it was better than true believer
i gagged my way through the notebook but thought i would give nicholas sparks another try i read about 1 3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time
although there can only be one notebook , sparks draws you into his stories that makes you want to read them again and again
i have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote at first sight like me , you probably loved all the characters in his previous books he makes every character in this book not loveable ! i kept asking myself , who am i rooting for \? do i care if things go well \? the best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book could have been a story in itself i miss the old spark
after being very disapointed in true believer i felt this novel was much more realistic and connected better to the characters he has redeemed himself in my opinion with this novel a good easy read , very enjoyable
this book was on the bestseller 's shelf at my local bookstore i asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews shocking as a number of other customer 's have commented on this site , this book was not worth the money it cost it was silly , contrived and unrealistic
i have n't read many books written by patterson but i liked the notebook so i thought i would read some of his other publications i did n't find much to like about at first sight
i ca n't believe i did n't know anything about this time in us history before the chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating this book is very well written you 'd think a book about architecture might be dry , but its really not at all highly recommend this book its a slo a great book for a book club
one of the best books ever , and i read 2 a mont
as a criminologist , i have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one the research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook , so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures this is a must read for anyone interested history , the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the victim offender relationship bravo to mr larson
reads like a murder mystery , but represents itself as being factual a really incredible story and a piece that should be read by all chicagoans \( i live in colorado but was born there \) fran
extraordinarily well written highly recommeded for anyone interested in , not just chicago history , but turn of the century events
a fascinating look into chicago 's life and times at the end of the 19th century with the background of the world 's fair and the personalities of the major movers and shakers of the era
a strangly fascinating book did n't expect it to be so engrossing lived in chicago for a time , and find i knew little about the history
i learned some odd new things reading this fascinating book made me do more research on the exposition
this book had me from the first line a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction two stories are told side by side , one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes jack the ripper pale by comparison the result is a book that is almost impossible to put down it left me with an appreciation of the energy , talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world 's fair and the genius of inventors like george ferris
the author has a decent touch with action sequences \( few though they are in this book \) and he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story but he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened why did this clue appear earlier \? what is the significance of this event \? what trends should we see based on events so far very clumsy style which veers into hardy boys book territory but when he finishes explaining everything that 's happended so far he writes competently if you got the book free and like the genre it 's worth reading on a plane
i am drawn to many cultures , ways of life to learn john donohue follows the further adventures of martial arts student and master in a satisfying sequel to sensei for those who are trying to find gone with the wind , fuggettaboutit for those who like to read of martial arts , tibetan enlightenment , and a continuation of a wondeful cast , this is for you
let me start by saying that i'm a dedicated fan of this genre that means of course that i 've read lustbader , trevanian , eisler , and now both of donohue 's books this particular book came by recommendation of my father , also a huge martial arts fan \( and fellow practictioner \) i can totally respect donohue 's effort , because i know first hand how hard it is to put together a compelling martial arts thriller i recently published a martial arts novel my book features a judo kenpo master hunting a world class sniper whose killing presidential candidates it 's more of a mainstream thriller inspired by lustabader 's early erotic martial arts violence see process of elimination if interested end of shamelesss plug !
deshi builds on the outstanding work of sensei the characters of dr conner burke and his teacher are more deeply and richly drawn donohue reveals more about the martial artists who train and study not to fight and spar for trophies but to fight and spar with their own lives like great mysteries , the mystery plot is really secondary to the mysterious inner workings of human beings on that mark , donohue does an amazing job he captures a world that may surprise people who know the martial arts only from the one dimensional , chop socky jackie chan bruce lee jet li movies \( which i enjoy too \) as a black belt myself , i can attest that his insights and conflicts are authentic and well reasoned let 's hope the series continues because it has the makings of a real classic
john donohue 's deshi is an excellent tale of clashing cultures , an exquisitely flavored and nuanced mystery featuring college professor martial arts expert connor burke , a character whose background mirrors the author 's own
edward sakura sees the man in his shodo hut on his brooklyn estate and knows the intruder is going to kill him before he dies , he creates a message in calligraphy that reads spring wind the police think it is a clue to his murderer and one of the lead detectives brings his brother , martial arts expert connor burke , is called into the investigation since he is an expert in things asian it is learned that sakura has sent a calligraphic scroll to professor hoddington in georgia for an evaluation
this is not a connect the dots book what this book teaches you is not step by step advice on how to go out and make your first million
this is a really good read , diffidently not a waste of time i would recommed it to my family and friends i would also like to recommed scot anderson 's book think like a billionaire become a billionaire it has truly changed my thinking and has taken off the limitations that we put on ourselves
jesus , what a narcassist , i mean is this guy for real why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over the emperor has no clothes , people ! the only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes , he had such staggering debt , he would have sunk the bank id love to know what his net worth really is but you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press , and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over , they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is , though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid maybe a paternity test is in order how to get rich drive up ur debt to such a level , and owe so many creditors that they cannot afford to call in your debt priceless
i have a terrible confession to make i have read all of his books do i love trump \? no , but it is fun to read about trump his buildings are beautiful and he is a fascinating person having said that his books have a high degree of self promotion , and if you read some of the other unauthorized books you begin to understand that he is a complicated person , much more so than revealed in these books that he writes
there are plenty of books around on the technical aspects of
when is everyone going to learn there is no such thing as a how to get rich book the title for the book is a joke itself trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title seriously , if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich , why would he tell you \? this book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of the apprentice there is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality ! the advice is so mundane half of the book is memoirs of a week as trump boooring and i do n't want to read about the show in the last chapter i cannot believe this book was published the writing stinks and there is even some typos trump may produce quality buildings , but that cannot be said of his books
i 've been a small biz man for about 15 years this book changed my direction i have a deeper respect for the donald than ever thanks d t
if you have 10 million dollars and you are losing 100 thousand dollars a day , then this book might be helpful if you are not a millionaire , then this book is not for you i can give you better advice on how to get rich than trump i understand he knows more than i do , however , he does not share a damn thing with you in his book
well , like everyone else , i'm still wondering how to get rich it 's implied that if you buy property , develop it into the nicest bling bling places to live , and sell , you 'll be rich
i recently finished my undergrad in business management , and have decided to return to school to earn an march degree this book has helped me in making this decision , as well as in knowing what to expect if it does make you change your mind , then architecture is most likely not the career for you if it 's worth doing , it probably wo n't be easy that said , it is not always as time consuming as people tend to think my fiance is working on her bachelor 's in architecture while she is often very busy , there are times that she has a lighter load than i did in business school it depends on the prof and the project
in this book roger lewis outlines the most important considerations in pursuing a career as an architect i have always loved architecture , and have read extensively on the subject at the level of an interested amateur when i was preparing for college in the 1980s , i wanted to pursue a five year professional architecture degree , but was dissuaded when i received a full scholarship in biology that was an unfortunate decision in the long run , although i have been doing well professionally until recently , when my career field went into steep decline i never forgot my interest in the subject , and while considering a mid career occupation change , i have carefully considered returning to school and attempting to be admitted to a 3 4 year m arch program
i have now been in the work force for 6 years having mostly worked in , now defunct , internet shops now i have a sterile job as a financial analyst working for a huge company after being afraid to pursue my dreams again \( after an earlier attempt in my mid 20 's withered away \) , i am seriously looking to get my masters in architecture although i have a liberal arts degree i first read cesar pelli 's observations which inspired me so i was afraid to get into this book knowing that many reviews here and in newsgroups claim it 's harsh or may change your mind about architecture actually , it has strengthened my desire to pursue architecture i wo n't be making as much money as i do now in my somewhat laid back job , but there are other considerations far more important to me than working just for money people who do not wish to be challenged to their fullest or work harder than they ever have worked before should not pursue such careers medicine , law , computer science , etc architecture is no exception i already knew architects are rarely rich , work very hard , go through a very tough education , and work in a very competitive environment none of that came as a shock from reading this basically , i can conclude from this book that the field should only be pursued if one loves architecture despite all the difficulties one can dislike medicine or law and not be as discouraged since the money can provide some comfort , but teh same is not true of architecture even if this book does talk many out of pursuing architecture , it 's better that it tells it like it is i 'd rather know the good and the bad before making a decision by the way , this book is not nearly as negative as some here have pointed out
i like how it gives good information and advice for someone like myself who was considering the profession it gave me an excellent idea of what to expect of the profession i just wish i had listened even more carefully to his advice when reading the book , especially the advice about taking some time off between highschool and going to school to be an architect one thing future architects need to realize is that if you are an architecture major , you will have no free time whatsoever outside of your classroom studio so if you have any wild and crazy side to you that just wants to party , i suggest getting that out of your system first and then go study architecture if there is any traveling you really want to do , do it first cause architects work hard and on average dont even make that much money anyhow this book contains other useful information for those who are certain they want to be architects as well it gives you an excellent idea of what to expect , the types of jobs you will be doing , the skills you will need , ect
i am an architect and a former student of roger k lewis this book was a suggested reading before my first year in studio after reading this book and then taking the classes , i can truly say that it tells the truth about the field if this book persuades you out of going into architecture , you would definitely not have been happy with it as a profession if you are seriously thinking about architecture as a career choice , then buy this book
plot interesting

i love this one because they haev to go to school and count o is the gym teacher adn makes them run for a very lond time and is a great boo

imagine michael crichton crossed with stephen king and you have some idea of what 's in store with to wake the dead the novel is essentially split into two parts , the first dealing with the discovery of the talent the ability to resurrect dead animals humans for a short time and the second with business and government 's attempts to capitalize on the talent dr woeste puts his expertise in molecular biology to good use here , creating a plausible scenario of research into the previously unthinkable and the talent 's reception by the scientific community i ca n't help thinking that if someone were to discover something like the talent in real life , events might play out very much as they do in to wake the dead
i just finished reading to wake the dead by steven woeste i found the story to be both enjoyable and compelling dr woeste 's research and science background give a deeper level of believability to the phenomenon of re animation this page turner was certainly a fun read with enough twists and turns to keep one thinking i will never look at road kill the same
animal physiologist ed harris receives an email from a scientist friend tom urging him to come over to his university over there tom shows him what he brought back from his latest field trip an undead dog ! the two scientists examine the poor creature and try to find out where it came from and how it got back from the dead this introduction with the scientist 's lab experiments and their subsequent investigation is a bit csi like \( e g they detect a 22 calibre bullet in the undead dog 's skull and back trace it to a gun buff club \) it turns out eventually that there are people , who have some strange supernatural ability \( the talent \) to resurrect the dead when the scientists present their findings at a conference of the national society for research scientists they are met with disbelief , outrage and hostility by the scientific community , prompting tom to commit suicide
steve woeste 's to wake the dead will keep you wanting to know what comes next actually just when you think you know what will come next , it does n't , and a new spool unwinds it 's quite imaginative and suspensfull although i am not much into sci fi , this book is different it will have a much wider audience it 's well written and a quick read i highly recommend the book
at the beginning of each chapter , i wanted to know what would happen in that chapter
right from the beginning i found myself hooked on this story as i followed the main characters , ed harris and tom bullock , in their quest to make sense of their discovery my curiosity only grew as i turned each page and i soon raced to the end the author keeps a fast pace with little clutter giving just enough information to keep you asking questions definitely a good read
i highly recommend this book the author writes crisply and eloquently and tells a captivating story as summer approaches , this is a very enjoyable read for the beach or any other vacation the chapters move quickly and the action never gets bogged down in other words , it 's a real page turner
although this score does not include all the intermittent recitatives and orchestral arrangemtnts , it does offer a good piano transcription of the major songs with words for anyone wnating to use any of the songs of jcs , this publication is very good
for the most part , i was pretty impressed with this there are some problems , most mentioned already my biggest issue with this is that it does n't include damned for all time blood money , my favorite song on jcs
the songs included in this book are heaven on their minds , everything 's alright , hosanna , pilate 's dream , last supper , gethsemane , king herod 's song , and superstar a few things should be noted firstly , heaven on their minds does not include the all gone sour last four verses that are used in live productions of jcs instead the song is written to fade away that might present a problem to people performing or using that song for an audition the last supper only includes the chorus that the apostles sing superstar is tuned to a c instead of the original e that is on all of the recordings and live productions other than that , all the other keys are the same as you might hear them on cd recordings , 1973 movie , and live productions chords are also included for guitar players
i bought this book when it first came out and love all the nice vocal selections in them now that it is the lenten season great time to go back and play and listen to them again on my old lps ! have a nice day ! buy the book
this is my second and probably last lehane book it 's not bad i found it to be worth finishing , so that warrants a weak 4 star rating but , i read this book shortly after reading george pelecanos' latest novel , the night gardener , and this one suffers pretty severely in comparison lehane seems to me to lack confidence in his ability to deliver a realistic , believable and still interesting story he reaches too far to make his characters and scenes a little cooler , a little more powerful and ultimately a little less true to life that 's what people want , i suppose , from action thriller books but , i 'd rather read something i can really see as realistic for crime drama this book is not quite that
what it must look like to be inside his brain ! another good read , got a little confused on one part , but overall a great book but do n't forget to finish up with prayers for rain , it 's greatness
investigating the kidnapping of four year old amanda mccready , daughter of a neglectful single mother druggie barfly in dorchester , massachusetts , private investigators patrick kenzie and angie gennaro get caught up in one of their most challenging cases the fourth in the kenzie gennaro series by lehane , this case is not just a kidnapping on their home turf the pair also investigates cheese olamon , a scandinavian giant they knew when they were growing up now a drug dealer with serious underworld connections , a convict and enforcer amanda 's mother has been involved with olamon and may have lucked into a 200 , 000 payoff meant for him , within moments of cheese 's arrest and incarceration no one knows what happened to the money or whether it is related to the kidnapping of amanda
if you have n't read lehane 's illuminated manuscripts then stop what you 're doing \( afer you finish this \) put your mouse down and click on buy because you will not be sorry lehane is all i ever wanted in a writer \( and boy , do i want a lot ! \) , so if you want everything and more in a mystery , then lehane is the one just be ready because he will blow your mind \( is n't that what his name means in french \? ! a massive explosion high in the air \) how appropriate this guy is no faker dennis is a gift from the gods er wait he is a god ! ! ! he certainly is tuned into frequencies we mortals cannot see
to say this novel was a mystery does it an injustice , it was so much more a fully realized literary treat for avid readers of lehane 's angie patrick series , or for just a casual reader in general you do not have to have experience with the other novels in the series to appreciate this one , though it does help immensely if you have knowledge of the respective pasts of angie and patrick in establishing their character for this novel lehane tackles a tough , disturbing subject in a manner that makes you think there are no easy answers here and for readers wanting a neat , tidy ending , you will not get one in this novel in that way it is true to life often if he had ended the series here , it would have been alright because nothing will ever top this novel i read somewhere they were trying to make a movie of it , and i will see it , but the emotional intensity of the novel will be tough to match when condensed to two hours to sum up my feelings about this novel , i will say this , michael koryta \( young mystery author of some acclaim \) credits this novel for turning him into a writer and making him want to write for those of us without the talent , this novel makes us wish for more , that we could somehow have penned lehane 's words as they are heartbreakingly true and real

left alone in a squalid boston apartment by her neglectful mother , four year old amanda maccready is kidnapped , creating an instant media sensation impatient with the police , amanda 's aunt and uncle plead with ex cops patrick kenzie and angie gennaro to join the investigation acting against their instincts , the lovers reluctantly accept the case the search for amanda takes a heavy toll on all involved , especially the private detectives they uncover a dark conspiracy that drains them physically , mentally and emotionally , causing them to question their beliefs and ideals normally sharing the same world view , the duo find themselves in opposition when confronted with a morally ambiguous situation at the end of the novel the decisions they make at that crucial moment have a profound impact on their self images and on their future together
dennis lehane and clint eastwood have something in common they are the masters of stories that grip you and keep you turning the pages , but finally depress you about the state of the world and its unanswerable dilemmas
lehane writes best when writing about the escapades of the kenzie gennaro team , and this book is at the top of the five he has written about them so far the action is relentless , the suspense is biting , and the humor is suffocating a must have
i was impressed by this book i struggle with casseroles , but long workdays necessitate the need for me to master them if you are familiar with cook 's illustrated , there 's nothing new here in terms of format i do applaud them for approaching casseroles in a new way by including one pot meals , slow cooker meals , skillet versions and more exotic casseroles
i love that the authors did multiple tests on every recipe to come up with the best final version and told us why , what went wrong and the reason for each process
many of the recipes use an abundance of heavy cream , half and half , whole milk or butter i'm sure these dishes taste good , but people i cook for do n't need to eat such rich food
i am a cookbook lover i love to read cookbooks , and this book is great for that it is filled with tips from cook 's test kitchen about the best way to do things but i also like to cook and to be able to make things that my husband and children will eat this book has given me enjoyment on both of these levels i have made many of the recipes and have not been disappointed and plan to make many more the mac n cheese recipe is excellent , the lasagna great , and i recently served the potato , bacon and egg casserole to rave results in fact , my mouth is watering just thinking of how that smelled while it was cooking
i own four other cookbooks from the editors of cook 's illustrated , and i subscribe to their two magazines their recipes are consistently delicious , easy to follow , and compliment garnering this cover bake cookbook is no exception i have made five dishes so far , and each one has been a 'wow ! ' the flavors are absolutely fantastic the preparation is smooth , uncomplicated , and quick these are recipes i will make again not only for my husband and myself , but for company , as well yes , they are that good \( truly , the smothered pork chops alone will make you swoon \) i appreciate the equipment and food brand recommendations throughout the book , as well as the clear explanations on food preparation technique this is a cookbook to get excited about
i have many cookbooks , especially american homecooking types one dish meals are my favorites and this book answers my requirements for a home cooking cookbook ! i have been a subscriber to cook 's illustrated for several years now , and have four of the best recipe series books cover bake is true to form and is another outstanding , very useful , well illustrated and written cookbook ! i will make it a christmas and wedding present book , as it has appeal to all cooks my thanks and hats off to cook 's illustrated
i have been looking for the cooking book that i can really trust for the taste i used to love cooking with challengeful recipes , but with my baby , i just do n't have enough time for the long complicated recipes anymore when i saw this book first i just wanted to try the skillet recipes it just looked very simple and quick i really just followed the instruction step by step and both my husband and i agreed it was super delisious not only that ! they are easy to follow \( very detailed instructions \) and most of all , very quick to get done by dinner time even though i'm always busy with my baby ! ! thanks heavens
i love to cook i love to eat good food but , i have a job , a preschooler , an old house , elderly relatives that need my help the list goes on life is too busy for all of us and we are all guilty of making poor food choices because of our lack of time
first , it is not true that none of these recipes seem to be original i too find it very irritating that cook 's repeats so many recipes from publication to publication , but that is not a significant problem with this volume some things that may appear to be repeats actually turn out to be reworkings ie , chicken vesuvio has been reworked into a weeknight casserole \( a slightly optimistic description \) , and the gumbo here has chicken rather than shrimp \( a change from their previous recipe \) i usually get the new books from the library and copy out the new recipes that interest me , but this one would be worth buying
if you ever have a chance for a collector to show his collection , you run the risk of being terribly bored unless you yourself collect stamps , coins , thimbles , hummel figurines , or corvettes , you are unlikely to sympathize with the delight the collector takes in his hoard ricky jay is a fascinating man he is a master magician , a historian of show business \( especially of novelty acts \) , and an actor in david mamet 's movies he collects something few others do showbills for the jugglers , magicians , animal acts , ventriloquists , and other eccentric and novelty performances through almost four centuries do n't worry , it is far from boring around eighty of his specimens are on display in a large format book , extraordinary exhibitions the wonderful remains of an enormous head , the whimsiphusicon death to the savage unitarians \( quantuck lane press \) the broadsides are funny and beautiful , and jay 's learned and enthusiastic commentary about each one is on the page facing each specimen it is all thoroughly entertaining , and like any show advertising , the posters make you wonder if the acts are really as described there is so much verbal and graphic hyperbole on display here that a bit of incredulity is only sensible , but still who , if confronted by an announcement for signor cappelli and his learned cats , with assurances that after he introduces his cats to the audience , they will beat a drum , turn a spit , grind knives , strike upon an anvil , roast coffee , ring bells , set a piece of machinery in motion to grind rice in the italian manner with many other astonishing exercises , who , i say , would let incredulity overcome a wish to get a peek at the show \?
this is a wonderful book by a truly genius author also , make sure you put ricky jay 's other books on your list he has a great mind and his books are phenomenal !
ricky jay is a national treasure he 's the head curator of a continuing collection of the curious , marginal , sometimes macabre but always compelling congregation of entertainers who have slipped through the trapdoor of time 's stage his newest masterpiece , extraordinary exhibitions , is a catalogue of broadsides heralding some of the strangest performers that ever graced an auditorium or a sidewalk you 'll meet pietro stadelmann , a seventeenth century armless dulcimer player as well as the nameless 27 year old angolan famous african hermaphrodite and a south american trio whose huge excrescences extruding from their chins gave them their stage moniker the monstrous craws you can sit at the feet of joice heth , the 161 year old former nursemaid of little georgie washington , the marvelous showman p t barnum 's first client there 's singing mice , educated fleas and a rabbi whose demonstrations of his prodigious memory were endorsed by the pope himself to paraphrase the immortal charles fort , you 'll see a procession of the damned of showbiz and thanks to the wonderful mr jay , they 'll walk \( and bark , tumble , juggle , catch bullets , arm wrestle , rope dance and eat stones \) again
i first read this book in 1993 \( i was out jogging one day and overheard two people discussing how it had changed their lives i immediately bought it \) i especially like how it helps you to develop a healthy disregard for unsecured debt too often , we buy things on credit because we believe that we ca n't wait until we have the money this book will help you to develop the proper mindset toward debt with that essential foundation , you then address the problem of your specific debt i especially appreciated his frequent reminder that you 're not a bad person just because you owe money i 've recommended the book many times through the years
i bought this book at least 10 years ago , when i was a single mom and deeply in debt it completely changed the way i thought about debt and financial freedom i titled it my debt bible because 10 years later , i still refer to it when i need a reminder or some inspiration it 's not about deprivation , it 's about living a good life without having to go into debt this book is awesome i 've recommended it to all my friends
thank you for a great book
this book saved my life here is the thank you e mail i sent to the author
first off , if you make minimum wage or live paycheck to paycheck , this book may not change your immediate situation if every cent you have is going to necessities \( food , clothing , utilities , rent mortgage \) , you may not have a penny left over you may even be living with the help of credit cards and getting deeper in debt
and make no mistake , you can make zilch or millions each year , and still get finances and everything related to them hopelessly , destructively wrong all it takes to accomplish that is ignorance , a self destruct wish , or even just simple mismanagement of everyday debt aside from the ilk of bill gates , almost nobody in america is financially independent and self sufficient we live trapped in a gotta have it now mentality and credit is our crack pipe
this book is awsome and it make so much sence i have read it 3 times and highlighted parts the best debt reduction book around worth every penny when you can see that there are ways to get out of debt no more worrie
i think this book is just great it really helps you think about the performance of your direct reports and to articulate it clearly i appreciate the way the book is laid out too very helpful goals section helps you give constructive feedback to your employees this book literally sits open on my desk as i write each review
as soon as my book arrived , i started flipping through the pages reading a few of the phrases on each when i realized this book is exactly what i need i 've been putting off my own performance review for several months now \( yeah , i work for a manager the ceo who is very bad at completing performance reviews \) as if writing an effective performance review is n't a daunting enough task , for me at least , it 's ten times more difficult when it 's my own performance i have to rate i'm my own worst critic and this book is going to help me be more objective every page contains relevant phrases that i know i 'll use over and over again this will become an integral part of my hr toolset ! p s i stayed up past midnight completed my performance review it was a breeze !
bart ehrman 's the lost gospel of judas iscariot is a one stop survey of every facet of the headline making find it 's discovery , authentication , content , and significance i wondered a little whether ehrman would be able to keep it interesting once you get past the initial glitter , there 's a fact which ehrman has commented on in his other works , that ancient gnosticism was pretty weird and hard for the average person to maintain a deep interest in however , ehrman handles it all as skillfully as i 've come to expect from his previous works , such as misquoting jesus and jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millenium
this is a good read for anyone interested in church planting strategy obviously this includes church planters themselves , but it may also include sending christians who want to learn more about mission strategy unfortunately , there are missionaries that do not allow future potential leaders to develop into leaders this book stresses the importance of developing christians that will be able to lead missionaries need to train and develop christians in a way that allows them to be trusted with ministry
this book was very helpful but still going to have to bring this crazy dog to classes
i bought this book since it had such a low price and the reviews were good , even though there were only a few reviews on it i found it very informative and it makes a lot of sense i do not have my puppy yet to see if the suggestions work , but i will definately be following it once i do get the puppy it is pretty basic though , telling you how to teach sit , stay , come , and heel , plus has chapters dedicated to dog problems such as barking , jumping , and so forth it focuses mainly on clicker training , and also goes over crate training for housebreaking i would have preferred more pictures to illustrate the different things talked about , and maybe a couple of sample forms to give you examples of the logs to keep for training and all , but those are not all that necessary
i highly recommend gerilyn j bielakiewicz 's the only dog training book you will ever need which gives you the a z of raising those cute but oftentimes unruly pups the book is written for novices in mind and had been a major life saver when i was at a complete loss as to what to do when i adopted a 3 month old pembroke welsh corgi \( a notoriously difficult breed to raise \) a couple of months ago the book delves into the highly effective method of clicker training for dogs at length , resulting in my teaching my pup over 10 commands in just days \( ! \) betsy brevitz 's hound health handbook is also another excellent reference book which offers credible advise from a writer turned vet behind the award winning website , these books are must read for owners who are experiencing problems in obedience training and or understanding their dogs prospective owners who are contemplating what breed to buy and the pros and cons of adopting a dog to complete their lives and homes will also find them useful puppies for dummies is another book written with the novice in mind it offers practical clues like playing classical cds on repeater mode while owners have to leave their dogs alone to not make a song and dance when owners have to depart for work or retire to bed \( no no to grandiose departures returns gestures \) to what to look out in dog food labelling et al 5 stars for their comprehensive contents , readability and effectiveness !
this is a great book and is good to accompany other training books such as good owners , great pets
this book starts in chapter 1 going over man 's condition , how that man has gotten away from god , and needs to come back to him chapter 1 also tells how depraved man is and has a need for the savior chapter 2 continues in the same vain as chapter 1 chapter 3 , 4 , 5 , show man is a sinner , there are none that seek after god , but god seeks them chapter 5 mentions that adam fell in the garden of eden , but that jesus as the new adam did not fall and that jesus has paid our sin debt chapter 6 tells how that those who have accepted christ are no longer are the law of moses but are free from the penatly of sin chapter 7 teaches about man 's desire to do things that are sinful , and that it is easy to do things that are sinful , but hard to do things that are right chapter 8 mentions that those who are in the spirit with jesus and are joint heirs with him chapter 9 tells about abraham and elijah , as well as the fact that sarah would have a child is told about chapter 10 tells about man 's need for christ and how that man can accept christ chapter 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 cover the old testament people , the fact that christians should offer up themselves as a living sacrifice to christ the obeying of laws of the land , and to higher powers that after accepting jesus , he will be our comforter , our help in time of trouble chapter 15 talks about paul 's ministry , and chapter 16 is a personal greeting to those he knows who have accepted jesus christ as their savior
just read jane adams' review on la dead by stuart woods
i am surprised at the low star rating on this book as it was truly a good read however , having said that , i'm still in a quandary about who did it ! who killed vance calder \? i used to think arrington was n't too bad , but in this book i really lost respect for her she 's a weak whiner and does n't have much understanding for others or a backbone to stand up for herself stone , of course , continues to be a whore and sleep with every beautiful dame that comes along i really hope he 's finished with arrington , but i have my doubts is arrington 's son vance calder 's or stone barrington 's child \? we still do n't know , but we have our suspicions because calder had enough money to get the original dna tests skewed i simply love dino and stone sure should have listened to his partner about getting involved with dolce what a frightening mess that woman is ! truly , it 's a fun ride in the life of stone barrington especially if you want to listen to the book on tape
whodunit \? we 're all left not quite sure at the end but we have a great deal of fun getting there
wow , this book was fantastic from the very beginning i could n't stop turning the pages i'm not sure why this book had a lower average rating , but i thought it was fantastic
save your time , money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous , predictable stone barrington novel the short forever wow , this one stinks like others , i put up with the shallow characters , ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers , boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately , this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance \? and come to think of it , who gives a damn \? i do n't what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character , save for isabel the maid , felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb , vacuous , self centered and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic ! the only normal female character who spared stone , mary ann , unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude , but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth mr woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought
okay , it 's a collection of far side comics , which is what i want , so it 's awesome for that reason but , the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing first , all the comics are black and white yeah , it 's not about the art and you do n't miss much without color , but come on , would a little color kill anyone \( especially ones that were originally color \) \? second , it 's pretty thin on strips , with 4 to a page most of the time \( a good amount \) sometimes 2 on a page , and even occassionally one comic on a single page ! it looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page
some of my earliest memories are filled with reading the far side on my father 's lap after the evening meal whenever i asked my parents for a one of the standard collections , they told me to wait , one day they would all be in one book then , for christmas one year , i got this book
gary larson never ceases to amaze me i 've been a religious follower of the far side for as long as i can remember i love the way he looks at the lighter side of life , yet some of the comics really hit home my favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark ! go larry you 're my super hero
lol ! ! ! ! this is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick \( in a good way \) mind the far side is timeless i laugh every time i read them , and that 's a good thing
how gary larson keeps coming up with this stuff i have no idea it seems like the more i read , the more i begin to laugh this particular gallery is totally hilarious if you do n't get the humor in the far side , my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books in fact , i heard the current president has n't got a far side chuckle since 1991
the far side is my favorite comic , out of all it is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard larson 's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on , comparing the picture to the caption , and it is hysterical there are scizophrenic kangaroos , plane driving sheep , duck relays , and pretty much any other twisted idea out there
sick , absurd humor is larson 's specialty , and in this collection , larson is at his best many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species , where animals get their revenge on humans others are based on themes from popular culture , such as tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling kemosabe that the music is starting they are funny , but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram if you are a fan of larson 's unique brand of humor , then you will love this collection
why not write a cartoon book that does n't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next \? ! that must have been similar to what gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books every joke is truly different from the next one ! and every joke is refreshingly original ! each joke comes from a thoughtful , clever and of course playful mind
i do n't know how the guy does it they keep getting funnier and there are always ones i 've never seen before , as well as the ones i 've always loved you wo n't be disappointed if you are a far side fan if you 're not a far side fan , well , then i ca n't help you
when i started work at my present job almost two years ago , i found that the place needed a little 'lightening up' it was casual already , to some extent , so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip' i picked up this calendar for my desk well , it began a new office ritual everyone wants to know the far side of the day ! sometimes , it 's the only funny thing to happen all day larson needs to come out of retirement
my cassette tape version was read by john ritter who was one of the few people who could actually read dave barry correctly he puts the emphasis in the right places and pauses to make the jokes work perfectly
i do n't read much , i just do n't really like to but reading this book is not like reading at all this is by far the funniest book i have ever read dave barry is the funniest man alive i do n't laugh much or loud , but as i was reading this book to myself i would find myself laughing out loud very very often
my husband requested this book , not remembering he had already read it never mind he loves dave barry 's writing so much he read it over again i wonder whether he will pass this copy on to the same cousin who got the first copy
dave barry fans will love this compendium for newcomers , it is a very good intro i can take barry only in small doses \( one essay at a time \) , but those doses are so enjoyable that i find myself craving the next and the next and the next uh oh am i a junkie
i was born in 1984 i did n't even know who oliver north was before i read this book but dave barry is so funny it 's worth doing not required for school research on public figures of the 80 's simply for the payoff of getting his jokes about them and , of course , there are plenty of timeless inter generational jokes about etch a sketches and boogers , too
the cover of my book features its author badly sunburned holding a keyboard on the beach and squinting into the camera the collected columns display the same kind of amused perplexity with quirky wit , barry skewers such tempting targets as ed mcmahon , baseball fans , tupperware parties , mutant fleas , inept motorists , chipper ski instructors , and of course , the dangers of indoor plumbing there 's even a brief foray into serious territory with the genuinely touching a million words a must for barry fans
a humorous collection from his newspaper column
there are a lot of lincoln books out there and i was looking for , and found , a good starting point i thought this was a very even handed portrait that gave you a sense for the man and provided just enough information on the politics and events of the day to provide context , without bogging down the epic story
the lincoln who emerges in this well crafted but sometimes tedious biography is not the lincoln of northern hagiography or southern demonology he was a moderate who avoided controversial decisions as much as possible
after reading the book leadership on lincoln , i wanted to learn more about the life of this fascinating figure in american history this title provides many details about the man , his many tragedies and failures , and his ultimate success as a leader the author does well in not standing in the way of his subject he simply unfolds the story before the reader 's eyes this volume is rather large at 600 pages , but the read is an enjoyable one for anyone wanting to discover a thorough treatment of the life of abraham lincoln , this book is an excellent investment
this biography has a flow that pulls you in i was surprised by some of the revelations , such as the complexity of internal politics he had to deal with it gives an image of an honest , ambitious , great leader a leader who himself is unsure of many things \( such as the civil war \) recommended
david herbert donald truly does the work of the historian and allows the reader to come face to face with the real lincoln the importance of the subject demands as much the upbringing , temperament , private life , politics , pressures , shortcomings , and ideals of the man who headed the united states during the civil war and ended the institution of slavery donald 's biography captures all of this , but what i appreciated most was getting to see how lincoln lived the conflict between some of america 's greatest ideals and grimist realities in both what he was faced with and how he conducted himself as president
easily one of the best written lincoln biographies of the last quarter century but not of all time donald 's book has been labeled a masterpiece and while it comes close , i myself would n't go so far i think it 's an easy book to read and it flows very well however , david herbert donald made the mistake \( in my opinion \) of leaving out the text of abraham lincoln 's greatest speeches and letters \( ex the gettysburg address \) if even for reference other than that , it is an amazing story of an amazing man abraham lincoln has inspired many over the years and truly came from the most humble of beginnings to become the savior of the american republic one of the first american dreams realized after reading this book , i guess the one thing i previously did n't comprehend is how lincoln was n't a hero during his presidency nor was he a master statesman as history has since rightfully judged him to be no matter how much you read about lincoln , his life never ceases to amaze lincoln is good brief general biography of this amazing man and well worth the effort
the more i read about lincoln the more i realize what an incredibly extrodinary man he was no one book can cover all of the complex person lincoln was , nor of all that went on while he was alive
david herbert martin gives readers a very personal view of lincoln we see that old abe was honest and gifted , but also calculating , ambitious , and burdened by self doubt perhaps that 's normal for an introspective man who overcomes poverty , depression and tragedy the author maintains this very personal focus as he details lincoln 's rise from young legislative leader and one term congressman to national figure as visionary builder of the nascent republican party in the 1850 's
the lincoln book gave a good brief overview of his life if you are looking to write a college paper on him this is not enough information , but good for general knowledge
how i wish this book had been around for the many years i taught catcher in the rye and franny amp zooey to my high school students i read half of love and squalor on my feet at a bookstore i could n't stop reading long enough to buy it until the place was closing 14 gifted writers responding to their experiences with not only catcher but the whole scanty salinger cannon how i wish there had been 28 ! the writings range from the good to the extraordinary i particularly loved charles d'ambrosio 's beautiful piece about suicide and crappy , broken down families \( and can that phrase please replace dysfunctional \? \) , john mcnally 's insightful observations on the fabulous minor characters in catcher and karen e bender 's lovely literary 'first kiss' with holden best of all , the book has introduced me to these three wonderful writers , all of them new to me after reading catcher more than thirty times over the years , thank you all for making it new to me again
this book is very well researched and interesting it traces the history of american success literature from ben franklin up to the time of publication there is a lot of interesting material the only downside is it reads somewhat typical of books of its time period it is a little dry and even though the material is good , the book is n't a page turner
richard huber 's book should be required reading for anybody who wants to know what makes americans tick , and the values they embrace on the road to success in a fascinating historical narrative , he shows how capitalism and spiritual values have been intertwined since before the revolution today 's bestseller lists are topheavy with writers who promise a spiritual path to financial riches , but huber 's great contribution is to show how old an idea this really is in america , and his research is extraordinary in some cases , the same language describing positive thinking today can be found in historical tracts over 100 years old all in all , a worthy contribution to the literature and a splendid look at american economic and intellectual history
no single book will prepare you for any certification exam and with what the cissp exam costs you will want to make sure you are fully prepared i found this book worth the money it 's a good book to start you on the path to the cissp exam or for a final review of the subject matter it covers all the ten domains and unlike some books , which seem to read like stereo instructions , the language in the book was clear and understandable so get yourself several texts to study for the exam and make sure this is one of them you will have a good head start towards passing
cute describes these books in the 10 mintues a day series pleasant , a little fun , a little insipid but , really , not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study
this book really came in handy on our trip the menu cut out cards and the flash cards proved to be very valuable to us , especially since a friend gave us the bad advice that everyone spoke some english do n't believe that , there were a number of people that did speak some amount of english but we both wished that we had taken more time before our trip to learn a littlem ore of the language
my wife and i have now spent a good month learning with
i 've bought and used italian tapes and they were ok i still use them in the car something was missing , though i really needed to see the words because some of the pronunciations on tapes made it tough for me to really understand the word
i used this book in preparation for a trip to italy last spring and i found it very helpful at first i was n't expecting much from a work book , but they do a very good job at helping you understand the relationships between words , places , and things i found it a good compliment to also listening to audio learning guides such as pimsleur or michel thomas \( you can borrow these from your local library ! \) i definitely used this book for more than 10 minutes at a time
i know few languages but have never really spoken italian , only watched a few movies i am hoping to chat it up in italy i may not chat it up but with this book i will be able to defend myself the whole concept of a little study everyday works and the variety of practice styles aid different learning styles i have used this series to teach english as a second language and i have seen it start a non speaker
this is a great way to learn the basics the workbook concept works for me as i learn better if i write down concepts the only way this could be improved would be if a audio aid for pronounciation would be provided
this is a great book to help you learn italian if you really want to learn you need to study longer than 10 minutes but this book breaks it down for you in small segments i have the little stickers all around the house and find myself using italian everyday now without even thinking about it
it 's always difficult to find the perfect learn a little of the language before you go book this one 's not bad and i did learn what i needed to how do you get to , where 's the toilet \? , how much is it \? and other assorted phrases , as well as enough to understand at least part of the answers
one of the gimmicks of this book is that it comes with stickers you can place on objects around your house , labeling them in italian it may sound silly , but it works i will never forget what to call the door , the mirror , the cat \( okay , he 's not really wearing a sticker \) , or dozens of other common items around the house writing a word or phrase over and over again and repeating it out loud may seem like tedious exercises , but there is a reason why these kinds of drills are used in schools throughout the world writing and saying words is an effective way to reinforce them the pronunciation guide is helpful , although its weakness is that it does not tell you which syllable gets the emphasis this book is a terrific way to get started , but you will also need some kind of audio course , or a live teacher , to master the sound of spoken italian
what this book says is to eat less and exercise more this is supposed to be new and insightful advice \? the step counter that came with the book is crummy the battery rattles around in the thing and the steps do n't count correctly
a very interesting and different way of looking at weight control 30 pounds in 12 weeks i guess it works ! ! !
this book has really opened my eyes up to one thing why i had n't lost weight i 've been dieting since i had my son but hit a plateu i had n't been exercising regularly and with a long commute to work 3 hours round trip \) and then sitting at a desk all day , i wore the pedometer before trying anything in the book to see how many steps i was getting before making a conscious effort i was shocked to learn that i had only been taking 1500 2500 steps a day , on days i worked days i did n't work i averaged more around 5 6 , 000 still that was n't very good since the book gives you a minimum of 10 , 000 a day
i'm stepping the pounds off ! this book has great information on energy balance both for loosing weight and for maintaining weight
excellent approach to increasing exercise in your daily life while at the same time monitoring food intak
this book is very motivating i wear a counter \( included with the book \) to count my steps daily after several weeks , i 've determined that i can commit to achieveing 15 , 000 steps a day \( their minimum is 10 , 000 \) this book gives me a good understanding of what it takes to balance food intake with energy burned i 've lost about 10 pounds so far , with 10 more to go
although over 50 diet books grace my bookshelves , i did not order , the step diet for over a year i thought that it would be too simple i saw the pedometer that came with the book and thought that it was just another gimmick in the diet book lineup
a really great book with a simple idea walk a little more , eat a little less solid basics that are simple and fun the book is motivating and easy to read , although i would n't use the pedometer that comes with the book , it 's inaccurate
the step diet is a compact 7 and 1 2 by 5 and 1 2 book that explains exactly how you can lose weight by walking and making small dietary changes according to the authors the average american will gain a little bit of weight each year you can prevent this gain by adding 2000 steps to your daily walking to lose weight you add more steps and cut back on what you eat
i have read crossing the chasm and inside the tornado by moore , both very good books ! when i first laid my eyes on this book i had a slight feeling that there might be risk of overlap i think wiefelds saw this as well and got a good endorsement by his colleague moore to state that this is a complement , not a repetition that the book was published after the dot com , in 2002 , felt reassuring though a lot of good lessons were probably to be learned for the reader ok , so i had high expectations , but felt a slight doubt
wiefels get to the heart of high tech marketing nothing i have read has more insights or is more useful in the practical application of marketing constructs for high tech anybody in high tech , indeed in marketing of any sort , can benefit from these concepts
it 's a very simple and clear framework to keep in mind , with very practical results in day to day activities of product management \( specially for those , like me , come from techies backgrounds \) it 's reccommended to read the other 5 books of chasm group to fully understand the concepts , but to start using as product manager , this is the guide
i have been a keen student of the chasm group publications for a number of years and this book starts to bridge the gap between the theory of visionaries , tornados , gorillas etc and the application of the concepts in practice the style is very readable and filled with good common sense i have already started using it in earnes
he gets a bit off the wall towards the end , but overall a great read about the way that the changing face of technology is empowering individuals to do things that it took big companies to do just a few years ago
glenn reynolds has written a book that will be the starting point for many a future conversation i recommend it highly to anyone interested in informed commentary about the rapid changes our culture is undergoing
beginning with the tremendous impact that blogging has wrought on top down institutions such as government and big media , reynolds uses the army of davids metaphor repeatedly to advance his theory that loose , decentralized networks of individuals will be the diriving force behind a multitude of amazing changes taking place over the next 30 50 years when i say amazing , there 's not much hyperbole there the colonization of space \( seriously ! \) is one such dramatic change that reynolds hopes will be come about thanks to the power of the individual bypassing the beaurocracy of a government
glenn reynolds is n't known as the blogfather for nothing the tennesee law professor was one of the first among the intelligentsia to see the potential of web logs , or blogs , to change the media landscape as a daily reader of reynolds' instapundit com for 5 years , i am continually impressed with his analysis , breadth of interest , and good naturedness his posts are short , pithy and droll
entertaining , enlightening , empowering and throught provoking ! !
after reading an army of davids , i thought back eight years earlier when i still subscribed to the los angeles times and one of their princelings of political correctness announced that hereafter the la times would apply affirmative action guidelines to the sources of articles the article was such an unintended parody of political correctness that i rechecked to make sure that rush limbaugh had not written it how can these people get away with it \?
i read this book to learn about conservative thought although not a conservative myself i was interested in learning what the other half thinks i believe i have made a start in this but only a start the chapters in this book are short introductions to facets of conservative thought such as opposition to big government and opposition to affirmative action except for the authors support of socio economic affirmative action throughout , the philosophy of conservative thinking such as the belief that traditional values should be upheld is espoused i believe i got a good introduction to conservative thinking from this book as an added bonus the author lists books for further reading at the end of the book although this book has not changed my underlying moderate philosophy it has made me think it is interesting how people can take the same set of data and come to different conclusions about it d'souza thinks that the increasing gap between the rich and the poor is a sign of progress in that there are more rich people while liberals are worried about it 's consequences i recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn about conservative thinking
i love this book dinesh writes many useful things in this book some things are even funny like his pamphlet ideas dinesh says if you want to cause a controversy on campus , make some pamphlets one of the pamphlets he suggests making says feminist thought on the outside and to leav the inside blank tee hee hee \)
i read this book when a conservative friend recommended it to me and expected great things i was not dissapointed unlike a lot of political books out there , this one is easy to read , entertaining , and to the point if you have any questions about what conservatives believe and why , or just want to better aquaint yourself with hot political issues from a conservative perspective , you need to read this book in fact , whether you are young or old , conservative or liberal , you need this book to round out your library
first off , i am a young conservative , and as such i should like this book a lot of my friends have recommended it to me , and i loved what 's so great about america and got a lot out of the end of racism however , i have three problems with letters its arguments are too superficial , it has no logical target audience and its arguments are sometimes faulty
i read dinesh d'souza 's what 's so great about america \? and it is one of my favorite books so , i decided to try another , and i have to say that there is much to like about this one even though , in reading conservative books , i have found that i agree 99 of the time with the social and moral positions , but only about 1 of the time with the economic positions
i am impressed with this book
if you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book the book , quite disappointingly , does n't present logical arguments which is quite putting off for a rational reader i 'll quote an example from chapter 9 \( why government is the problem \)
this book , while mostly fluent and often entertaining , is fundamentally flawed
my only conclusion about the popularity of d'souza is that he writes what his audience loves to hear his opinions , and that is all they are , opinions with little concern for research , analysis , and refutation because they are so general , must strike a nerve in many 'young conservatives' who feel they are unappreciated however , that does n't make his ideas right regardless of how much one wants them to be that any author would presume to be able to make a comprehensive analysis of current political ideology in so short a book is rather insulting to people who spend their entire lives seeking the truth that this forum is in the form of a 'letter' is condescending to individuals who want to arrive at truth if one is inquisitive about how the world works , why read the pre digested views of someone who immediately places himself in a one up position with the reader \? why not go out and learn about the world yourself \? are people so afraid that their biases just might be unfounded \? if so , it does not say much for one 's self confidence
i was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book , but was disappointed if you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or do n't know how to track trends , this book is for you if you are like me \( you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach \) , i would n't buy the book
i read the book from cover to cover and was thoroughly enlightened from a content perspective , the book is first rate carlberg not only explains how to forecast , but he also clarifies the pros and cons of the various methods , explains how to reduce forecasting error , and offers excellent insight into regression and the other statistics involved in making and evaluating a forecast
if for dummies means , clear , comprehensible , well illustrated , and fun to read to boot , then excel sales forecasting for dummies is true to its name when you put together a guide to one of the most powerful and useful pieces of software in any company 's arsenal with the genius of conrad carlberg to lead even the neophyte through the intracacies of sales forecasting , the combination is downright unbeatable carlberg has won awards for a string of some of the best how to books on excel and microsoft office this new one gets my personal award for best excel guide of the year
i know that dummies books are supposed to be easygoing and offer a lighter tone than most , so i was surprised to see this topic getting the dummies treatment i'm glad to report that it works excel sales forecasting is very reader friendly , and it demystifies intimidating concepts like exponential smoothing and mutiple regression i 've done a lot of numeric analysis but not much forecasting , mainly because the available texts are so dense and inpenetrable no more ! this book provides the material i need to understand , clearly and with useful detail and examples it covers the basics and also dips into some more advanced topics it considers not just the number crunching aspects , but also the business context that you 're forecasting into and it 's fun to read ! we dummies have a secret we 're smart enough to get books written for us that do n't make our eyes glaze over this one makes the grade
i picked up this book at random at the airport for something to read on my flight i am so glad that i came across it i ca n't wait to read john grisham 's new book about a similar case in ada sounds to me like they need to get a new da and take a better look at this case i would imagine that his career is pretty much ruined now though , heh the girl on the first page mentioned that she was donna denice haraway 's niece and that tommy and karl did commit the crime and that this book is full of lies with all due respect to that girl , as i know her family has gone through a lot but she was only 4 years old when it happened there is n't honest closure if the real murderer is still walking who knows how many others he has hurt who knows , maybe it was the same guy that killed the other girl , the one in grisham 's book
mayer 's missive about miscarriage of justice in ada , oklahoma , has been re released to coincide with best selling legal thriller author \( and attorney \) john grisham 's first foray into non fiction true crime , the innocent man murder and injustice in a small town although chronicling different crimes and different cases , they occur on common ground both constitute a grippingly nauseating expose of ada , america , run totally amuck \( be afraid be very afraid that this can and is happening right here , in the land of the free \) in the afterward to this update , \( no pictures \( mayer aptly describes the obscenity of district attorney bill peterson \( what \? ! \? he 's still there , in his absolute power \? ! \? proving what they say about absolute power it corrupts absolutely \) and his band of good old boys as kafka in oklahoma
denice and i grew up in the same small town in oklahoma it is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death this heinous crime not only shook ada , but also shook those of us who grew up with her in purcell , ok denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room she was a year behind me in school i recently pulled out a old high school annual looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories memories of a beautiful , innocent young woman who 's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye as important as it is that justice has been served in this case , it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget denice
tommy spent many nights , days weekends with my sisters and mother and is not the type to do harm to anyone he has even slept across my sisters feet in the winter when the electric was turned off , just to keep her feet warm i have seen and spoken to him many times since then and eventhough he has been convicted of a crime he did n't commit , he is still a caring person his only crime was to dream or in this case have a nightmare he will eventually be set free
i read this book well over a decade ago when tommy told me about it in a letter i knew both of these men fairly well and spent a great deal of time with them in the year before this crime occurred , particularly tommy karl was a little different \( mentally slow \) but he was always kind to me and tommy somewhat protected him because of what karl had been through with his mother 's death they had many opportunities to hurt me as they spent a great deal of time in my apartment and i had been over to tommy 's mothers' home a couple of times and his brother 's home on several occasions i moved away from ada just a few weeks before donna \( who i did not know \) was killed i also knew \( or knew of \) most of the other individuals in the book and if i had to choose who would be most likely to commit a murder , tommy would have been the last one i would have ever chosen when i knew tommy he was one of the gentlest souls i 'd ever known i can still see him talking and playing with his pet bird and how obvious it was that he valued life , even that of a a small creature i do n't believe he did it and i will never believe it this book will keep your attention and it will capture your heart as well
i have read many true crime books in my life
i grew up in ada tommy was one of my older brothers best friends i know tommy had many faults but he is not a killer he was very respectful of me and my sister and had a gentle heart i think this book tells many truths but several are not researched in enough detail my oldest brother melvin hardin is mentioned in this book but the information is only minute as to what actually occured however , i do think this book served its purpose as to get the finger off tommy and karl and will hopefully serve justice eventually i hope tommy and karl are released to at least live the rest of their lives as they choose
i really enjoyed packing volume three with me on a recent vacation trip feynman amazes me with his clarity of thought , clear explanations , and wonderful sense of humor why should there be anything difficult about the fundamentals of nature \? you really see how simple things are at the bottom , and only get clouded when working out the details feynman clearly separates the essence from the messy mathematical details of implementation i love how he beats a horse to death in one dimension before generalizing ! i'm sure that 's how all great minds work few books on quantum mechanics are of such a high caliber volume three is a treasure
these lectures are a boon to anyone interested in having a go at understanding both the micro and macro of our universe and what part we have in the scheme of it all feynman is both the essence of clarity and he provides the tools for scientific thought about the origin of the universe
i purchased the feyman lectures on physics because i always wanted have this material to prepare my lectures i did my graduation in french universities and the physics lectures there are something diferent from the anglo saxon way i always wanted to take advantage of my formation and the fact that i have acess to physics books from the us or uk to have another look to physics for this feyman lectures are essential the clarity and the originality of these lectures continue to inspire generation of teacher sometime i regret that the mathematical formalism is not more present , but this is due my formation
when i was 13 years of age , a family friend \( a professor of math and physics , \) loaned \( and never received back \) this set of books , to me
these lectures are a gold mine about physics i use the analogy of a precious metal lode in its full sense nuggets that will make you wealthy mixed in gravel for example , feynman 's discussions on brownian motion , leading to the derivation of binomial and gaussian statistical distributions and the central limit theorem are so insightful and profound that they border on being revealations on the other hand , he spends just as much time talking about storms and lightening \( if i were one of his students in the lecture hall , that 's when i 'd work on the homework for my next class \)
a one of a kind , down to earth , no nonsense physicist and the best sort of teacher
i read all three of these books over a six month period they are a fairly comprehensive study of college level physics at a beginning to intermediate level the most through treatment is given to the subject of electromagnetism
it 's exactaly the book for me the autor is a genius he show the ways for a to think diferent
richard phillips feynman is showing physics with an extremly clear view , providing all essentials of classical and quantum physics his lectures are the best an undergraduate can read to understand the nobel laurate from 1965 was able to explain everything in his own very intuitive way of thinking he is writing precise and shows a combination of experimental and theoretical physics which is searching still for competition sometimes , i thought , even albert einstein was not able to to describe thing smore simple very inventive are his ideas on the general theory of relativity in volume two it should be emphasized , that his physical intuition was leading him to the very important description of the aharonov bohm effect in chapter fifteen of volume two he shwos , that the vector potential must be a real field all in all , feynman`s work should be read more than once by every physicist i personally know men , who are experts in fields like superconductivity or gravity and still are consulting for these feynman lectures sometimes
jennings is always interesting and provocative , but also careful and accurate
american history never made sense to me and now i know why as voltaire said , history is the lie commonly agreed upon and that 's what was taught to me in school and is now taught to my son francis jennings tries to change all that with a revisionist history asking the questions that when posed by students in school are ignored by teachers how did material progress evolve in a country that was already populated by over 25 million inhabitants \? who owned america \? how did we shift from a policy of cooperation with the indians \( a la thanksgiving \) to one of aggression how much of our revolution was political and how much economic \? how did relations between colonialists and great britain deteriorate so quickly after so many years of harmony \? this book is an overview of much that jennings has written in earlier books with some further thoughts and ideas what is most enjoyable is that he is willing to speculate , to question accepted fact and wisdom , to go out on a limb , to offer an opinion on various events , characters and situations for the first time american history became real to me the people human , the events complex and contradictory , the struggle for independence understandable in the end a history not much different from what has been happening recently in washington the prose can be turgid parts of it are somewhat academic but jennings moves the story along and makes for me \( a non historian \) very telling points he left this reader with much to think about i have since gone out and bought his other books and will be reading those in 2001 a good balancing piece after this book is a struggle for power by theodore draper
i tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that i put it down in frustration it reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat the theme is interesting , the execution poor cannot recommend
hull is the one stop shop for learning \( and using as a reference once you have learnt it \) almost any topic in quant finance this book really has it all options , interest rate models , volatility modeling , credit derivatives , you name it however , use it as an introductory book learn the main concepts from here and then move on to advanced books as a current student of quant finance , i find hull 's book to be indispensable
i recently entered the field of quantitative finance from physics , and this book has been by far the best resource as both a learning tool and reference its bredth of coverage is outstanding , covering topics as simple as bond yields and zero rates , to sophsticated libor market models , weather derivatives , bermudan swaptions , etc while a bit wordy at times , hull does present all the mathematics in a tractible manner books with more mathematical sophistication , such as brigo mercurio , while interesting , are far less useful on the trading floor
insightful , shines with intuition , easy to follow good start point , inspire further study , and visit it regularly you 'll get more
i actually learned a lot math and physics from finance after i earned my phd in physics and started working as a senior analyst at a houston based energy firm \( not enron \) , and hull 's wonderful book got me started in econophysics , or econometrics as it is often called
hull is known as the expert on the options and derivatives i found the book easy to read and the examples are insightful however , the book is not meant for skimming one needs to focus on the material or important insight will be missed i have had to re read some portions of the chapter to completely understand what hull is saying
was expecting a book that really helps fairly new readers to the concepts of financial engineering this book is not well written and throws the reader into a lot of topics without any real world , practical examples a much , much , much , better book is investment science by luenberger get that book it kicks hull 's ass
the book options , futures and other derivatives is for me the best book out there for finance majors and professionals i have n't finished the book but i feel confident now to review it the structure and presentation of the book feels right , it starts with an introduction to forwards , futures and option contracts and it later builds slowly on the mechanics of markets and the determination of their prices then it moves to more complex instruments and subjects \( in my opinion \) like the pricing of these instruments \( black scholes , binomial trees , etc \) and some risk management instruments like value at risk in synthesis this book is a most have for any finance major or professional there is not much i can say that it has n't been said before this book is the one that will give any student the necessary foundation to dwell into the more advance topics and pricing calculations the only thing , i would like to recommend is that this book could be used with the financial toolkit of matlab it is a great teaching combination in my opinion currently my work prohibits me from teaching but if i could i would give classes of derivatives using this book \( \) matlab i think it is a nice combination and it helps students that do n't have the necessary mathematical background to understand it right away john c hull is one of our most valuable authors we have in the financial industry and his book should always be regarded as a jewel of finance
it is not surprising that hull 's book is the standard text in introductory graduate derivatives courses you clearly see a no nonsense format in his book that is the same for all serious finance books \( i e black text on a white background with only shades of gray \) being an intro book , he jumps steps in some of the more challenging derivations for the beginner like in the black scholes options pricing model and does n't discuss ito calculus in much detail however , there are clearly books that focus on those topics and they are clearly more advanced than for an intro course this book is a definite must buy
although john hull 's book options , futures , and other derivatives is considered by many to be the bible for understanding derivatives , i think this book took the same shortcut that many books on this topic have taken that is , they 've focused on options where the underlying asset are stocks , exclusively i suppose hull 's reason was to simplify an already complex topic yet , as a recent graduate with a degree in economics , i was hoping to find more information on options with commodities future contracts as the underlying asset the book is fairly easy to follow the dialogue is interesting without being boring however , if your interested in a beginning book about derivatives , look somewhere else if your interested in a book about derivatives that offers strategies , some useful math , and bases most of the discussion around stocks , this book might just be for you
the boston based author , dennis lehane , wrote a great detective story with a social background so great , it is almost more important than the plot mystic river differs from lehane 's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer
what 's wrong with all you amamzon reviewers \?
three childhood friends from a boston working class neighborhood , who lost their innocence through a tragic shared occurrence , are forced together again as adults when one of their daughters is murdered each is wrapped tightly into the investigation , but each must also unwrap themselves in order come to terms with this latest tragedy and its conclusion
this is a brilliant novel that i ca n't recommend highly enough
it 's a crime novel it 's human drama it 's gritty eloquent and literary there are few other writers to whom to compare lehane he has a style all his own and a beautiful way of weaving old fashioned crime fiction into a tapestry of moral drama and psychological examination
wow ! an intense read at time the subject matter can be difficult to handle , but the story is amazing the movie does not do the novel justice
when i bought the book i did not know that they already made a movie out of it but i learned about it later on so i was really excited when i started to read it also because other comments were really good
this book is very touching you get caught up with daves character this book pulls you in and keeps you on the edge waiting and wondering what would happen next it takes a turning point when one of the friends gets kidnapped by two man claiming to be officers during that time they fall apart at lease one of them does they lose there friendship after the incident and become friends again but not to the same strenght they did before until another problem occurs then all of them come back into contact with each other again it makes you think how far does friendship go \? alot of people that had friends when they where younger dont anymore so i ask my self a question how strong is a friendship after a traggic situation this book tells more info then the movie did and i like that i feel bad for one of the friends cause after all that happened to him he was different
i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we 're supposed to believe that the haunted , passive , timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school \? the book had a great premise and good beginning , but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character
dennis lehane 's mystic river is a suspenseful , mind teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more one of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child , but manages to escape four days later twenty five years after that , the friends have grown apart , and one of the men 's daughters has been mysteriously murdered this tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten i would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery
dear reader ,
here is the ninth volume in lemony snicket 's bestselling children 's collection a series of unfortunate events the baudelaire orphans had hidden in the trunk of count olaf 's car at the end of the hostile hospital to escape from a fire that olaf and his associates had set with the carnivorous carnival they arrive at the caligari carnival out in the middle of the hinterlands and are able to get out of the trunk before count olaf discovers them klaus , violet , and sunny disguise themselves as carnival freaks so that they can stay at the carnival and have the opportunity to discover some facts about the possibility of one of their parents still living and the rest of the snicket file klaus and violet are disguised as a two headed freak beverly eliot , sunny is chabo the wolf baby they join with other freaks , like kevin the ambidextrous man , colette the contortionist , and hugo the hunchback
this book is good , as always when it comes to lemony snicket \( daniel handler \) however , it was as not as good as i thought ti would be i would have to say , this book is my least favorite in a series of unfortunate events , but it is still very good
this book is the kids go to a carnival and the count is there again lol
this is one of my favorite in the series so far the characters are well developed proportional to their respective roles also , this book develops the overall series plot well as usual , snicket brilliantly contrasts the loathsome adults with the children to create his upside down world in this book , the adults are especially unlikable there is also the beautiful twist at the end for which snicket is known
the carnivorous carnival was a good book
there is one single reason why i 've bought this book i was looking for the best quotation dictionary available , at a low price every now and then i want to use a quotation in a text i write concerning to my work as a lawyer , but i never found such a book in local bookshops my search ended when i got to this book have yourself a copy as soon as you can you wo n't regret i assure you that
i regard this book as an indispensable and practical tool for personal leadership development quite often , we get or give 360 feedback where a growth opportunity is evidenced this book not only reviews each area of skills , but more importantly provides valuable examples that actually drive change
this book is a tremendous rescource for anybody who leads a team or organization in a increasingly complex , dynamic and global world it 's filled with practical advice , stories , studies and book references

i thought real estate investing loopholes was put together really well it has a lot of information that will help you find the tax loopholes that will help you best my favorite chapter was be paid to live in your home , by having a home office i have been able to write off more expenses and pay less tax it works i highly recommend this book thanks diane and dolf

page 202 says that 48 plus 15 equals 73
i ordered this cookbook for my daughter who is away at college i reviewed it before i sent it to her it has all the basics , how to shop for food , how to store it , how to prepare it , even basic cooking utensils that a beginner would need she loves it and uses it all the time so i think this the true measurement of the book being user friendly
if you 're one of those sure , i know how to cook except i do n't want to people , you need this book this book gives you the basics on how long you can keep meat , how to pick good cuts , what to do with vegetables , and the essential hints on everything you need to get started the best part of this book are n't the recipes , but rather the reference guides on the things you never quite know , like how to cook specific vegetables and how to build a soup or smoothie great for someone who has just moved into an apartment , or for anyone who wants to get a primer on cooking if you are puzzled about what tools you need , fear not it 's all very simple , and there are many , many diagrams in case you freak out with too many words
this book is incredibly informative it 's everything i wanted to learn about food , but was too lazy to ask where it comes from , what to look for when buying it , how to cut it all up and that 's aside from the great recipes this mass of info is fortunately so intelligently written and laid out that it never really feels like overload i 'd put the book on my coffee table if i did n't need it so much in the kitchen
i like to eat other people 's cooking this can be a problem as friends sometimes expect you to reciprocate and invite them over for more than beer and peanuts thanks to this book , i was actually able to have a dinner party well two friends over to the house on saturday and feed them a roast chicken and green salad that may not sound like much to you but it was a big deal to me the nice thing about this book is that it does n't make you feel stupid even if you know nothing about cooking for know nothings like me , it can start you at the beginning , but if you already have your four standby recipes it looks as if it could help you double or triple that number i recommend it for everyone
this is a history of various market declines and panics providing some useful insight , it is well written and deviates from the normal how to buy stocks book if you want a good read and like stock market and finance books , you should like this
john rawls is indisputably the most honorable spokesman of political liberalism of the past twenty five years his theoretical committment to and devlopment of liberalism is an inspiring attempt to reconcile the difficulties inherent in a heterogenous society in which different conceptions of the good life and varied value systems , beliefs , and principles can coexist and yet affirm the political conception of a constitutional regime how can a nation entreat its inhabitants to carve out their conception of the good life and their own value systems and yet achieve agreement on a set of principles that all citizens may abide by \? it is the answer to this question that rawls 's works have sought to answer the law of peoples is no less concerned with this question rawls 's attempts to extend a social contractarian approach to human existence on the international level is thorough and nuanced liberal peoples , he argues , have three basic features they possess a reasonably just constitutional democractic government that serves their fundamental interests they are united by common sympathies and above all , they have a morally mature nature critics who claim that rawls 's brand of liberalism invites a form of moral agnosticism had better think twice moral maturity and its genetic antecedent human moral nature , are the preconditions that underly the moral basis of liberalism in general deep respect for human beings and the necessity of treating them as ends in themselves rawls 's development of a just war doctrine should force us to re think traditional concepts of sovereignty and undermines the claims to legitimacy that outlaw states seek to impose on moral communities in the name of cultural authenticity in this respect rawls' work is indispensible to young liberal scholar 's such as myself in fact i have depended on his theoretical approach to ground much of my highly controversial and hotly contested book , becoming a cosmopolitan what it means to be a human being in the new millennium i argue , however , for a more pugnacious form of liberalism by rejecting outright , as conceptions of the good , all forms of tribal \( racial ethnic and national \) identities and argue for the obliteration of all cultural practices that undermine human rights for those who believe that moral progress is possible and who wish to further advance the idea that liberal democracies represent a superior and more evolved form of social and political living , the law of peoples is a detailed and rigorous application of this idea
our planet , gaia , is sorely in need of healing her earth , waters , and air are polluted natural resources are being depleted thousands of plant and animal species are becoming extinct
thomas berry has put together in this one book what a thousand other writers have attempted and that is a complete format for human perception of reality that should and can pervade through all our earthly activities , esp religion , politics and economy let earth and it 's biolgical processes teach and guide us to a rational , sustainable , regenerative , healthy existence
do n't be misled because thomas berry is promoted as a catholic priest , many people are falsely led to believe that his books present catholic or christian teaching about the environment instead , this book presents a new age blend of do it yourself religion mixed with pseudo science if you 're into that , you 'll probably like this book
a friend recently recommended this book in this deep ecology classic , berry examines man 's relationship with the earth he explores our mistaken beliefs that we are separate from the planet , and that it exists solely for human destruction , pollution , exploitation and profit he encourages us to take responsibility this book forever changed the way i will look at our world read it then read wes nisker 's buddha 's nature \( 1998 2000 \) to learn , from a buddhist perspective , how to put berry 's dream into everyday practice
berry is the first to clearly uncover the foundation the very fabric of the universe as found in fundamental earthly reality this reality expressed as differentiated reality , subjective reality , and communion reality represents the essential trinity contained within all elements of the within and the without of all existence this foundation will enable us to move forward and grow our understanding of unfolding cosmogenesis well beyond todays dreams this triple reality though largely hidden will become like a modem and enable the unfolding transformation of inner trinity to emerge as conscious objectivity and it is interactions within and among differentiated , subjective , and communion realities which are at the heart of and in fact represent the incipient communion experience which each reality of the universe offers to every other reality in the universe
i loved this book ! i had absolutely no idea what kind of dog i wanted to get before reading this book this book separates the breeds into very logical chapters and also cross references other chapters that the dogs would fit in i love dogs so much that i was only able to reduce the number that i 'd love to 19 , but it made me consider breeds that i never would have before once i reviewed my 19 with my family , we were able to bring it down to 6 and i'm now doing research on those 6 in order to determine which one we 'll buy this is a great read if you 're toggling between a few breeds and want to make sure you consider the good and the bad in the breeds
i wish i could afford to give a copy of this book to every library in the country i have been a volunteer for different animal shelters and rescue groups for many years most animals are turned in to shelters because of a mismatch between the owner and their dog , or because people are unaware of what 's involved in pet ownership the authors give a very realistic appraisal of different breeds i love dog fancy magazine , but so many times when they profile a breed they will describe good with children if they are raised with them paws to consider will be straightforward in telling you that a particular breed is not good with children this book also helps you decide when is the right time to add a dog to your household too many dogs are given up because the owners have decided to have a baby and do n't want to have a dog around the baby or an owner makes an impulsive holiday purchase and comes to regret the decision it is frequently devastating for a family , especially the children , to give up a dog it is also traumatic for the dog to lose its home and most of these dogs will be euthanized paws to consider goes a long way to promoting happy endings for people and the dogs who join their families
this book should be mandatory for anyone even thinking of getting a dog even if that dog is ten years off since i became interested in dogs and dog welfare , i have heard and seen too many times the unhappy scenario of dogs being dumped because their owners just did not bother to do any reasearch families duped by beethoven , lassie , and 101 dalmations decide tv never lies and buy one for their young children people who want a guard dog buy a rottweiler for protection and dump it out in the yard a calm couple wants a small , quiet , easy going dog , so they judge on size and get a terrier a jogger wants a partner and thinks a great dane will keep up
the best thing about this book is the common sense advice the authors give \( if you live in an all white house , do n't get a bouvier des flandres \) the realistic expectations , both good and bad , outlined for each breed are infinitely more helpful than , say , the breed standards promulgated by the akc most of us want a pet , not a show dog while the information on each breed is very specific , there is helpful information in the beginning for any dog owner or potential owner i also bought good owners , great dogs by the same authors great book as well
do not , i repeat do not buy this book , brian kilcommons and sarah wilson are both complete idiots we used this book as a reference when we bought our bichon frise , what a mistake in the book it states a bichon can be a 9 5 dog so we bought one bichons are extremely hard to housebreak , all the book says is they 'can' be hard to housebreak this book has cost us hundreds of dollars we ended up giving our dog away tonight because we could not get it potty trained and after further research found out that bichons do not like to be left home alone the book also says that a shih tzu is a nine to five dog but after researching that breed they also do not like to be home alone all day these two authors need to find a different line of work because they are complete idiots when it comes to dogs thanks brian and sarah for writing such a crappy book !
paws to consider is an invaluable reference for the average pet dog owner who 's looking to expand the family the breed descriptions are concise and direct , and for my money , right on point most of the time as a professional dog trainer and canine rescue volunteer , i see far too many dogs selected for their looks , or perhaps what a similar dog appeared to be on television or the movies in the past , most folks only had the breed books to use as a reference when trying to make a selection unfortunately , most breed books are not going to be too forthcoming about a breed 's drawbacks as a family pet \( when most of those characteristics were specifically put there as the breed was developed , for a specific purpose ! \) thanks to brian and sarah for putting the real deal out there and providing a road map for the average family pet owner when navigating the windy road of breed selection !
i sure am glad i did not waste my money on this book the author had very few good things to say about any of the breeds this book had so little information on my breed of choice , though it was seen on the cover , that it was a total waste of my time it almost seemed as though the book was written to turn people off to getting any type of dog at all ! lots of negatives about the breeds , not alot of positives alot of generalizations
this is a great book , the best of its kind that i 've seen i would , however , take issue with the authors' advice not to pay for a crossbred dog in my experience , a crossbreed \( especially a poodle cross \) is often smarter and better tempered than some of the purebreds and a good dog is always worth paying for
very good book a must read for anyone looking for a dog i have trained dogs for 11 years and this was right on the money
i 've yet to read something written by nora roberts that i have not been completely satisfied with she 's the kind of author that gives you everything your looking for all in one place , and always leaves you craving more
i'm a nora roberts fan , so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to after reading born in fire , i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in born in ice
well , after reading born in fire i did n't have much hope for born in ice but it was so much better then the first these are the first nora roberts books that i 've ever read this is the 2nd book of 3 in the born in series i really enjoyed it in the first book you were introduced to brianna this book is her story she is running her bed breakfast in ireland when a writer from america comes to stay at her inn he is there for several months while writing a book during his stay him brianna begin a romance that neither of them expect to continue once his book is completed this was a very peaceful enjoyable read i recommend this book in the series
born in ice is the 2nd part of the born in trilogy this trilogy is about three sisters two who know each other and one who is unknown the sisters are so different , at times it 's hard to image them coming from the same family
this was my very first book for nora roberts , and so far it 's the best book ever it is the perfect book brianna is a wonderful , smart inn keeper with many talents and a rare kind of maturity i would love to be like her ! and gray is a successful , sweet , caring , witty author that comes to her inn in ireland to relax and start a new book this is no ordinary romance i love that it goes deep , not only into the main characters' personalities , but there is also brianna 's sister and brother in law , her mother , her friend , and gray 's agent not to mention the wonderful scenary of ireland described throughout the book the conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying , leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time ! other books by nora roberts are good , but this one takes the prize of the born trilogy this one is the best and it should not be missed
i really wanted this book to be good it had the right setting ireland the right pairing a skillful , self confident woman and a tormented man , who is a writer \( very interesting to me as that 's my profession \) it also seemed to have the right author nora roberts but these three things did n't gel for me i was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book brianna 's character does n't hold interest , grayson is just plain annoying \( i would have kicked him back out into the rain \) and not romantic at all none of the romantic spark and unique nature of ireland comes through in this book when nora roberts is on , she 's really on when she 's off , you get born in ice
this novel was very frustrating for me because i just could not connect with the main character , sam i found him attention starved and annoying although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of sam , i have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if i ca n't connect to the characters
if i could 've given this book 4 and 1 2 stars i would because i read it straight through in about 2 days i thought it was really good , and although things didnt work out in the end , as my review title states , clay and sam have more passion between them than any 2 straight characters have had in a long time while theres alot of talk about punk rock and not much to be seen , i can bare with it when i was 1st starting to like punk , rancid and nofx were the 2 most punk bands i could think of , minding the ramones and maybe the clash sam 's narration is likeable , you do n't really get bored with this book , and it moves along at a good pace plus , the backdrop of hawaii was a really great place to set a love story so chaotic good stuff
i know a lot of people have written some really rave reviews about this book , but personally think this book sucked out loud the only reason the book could have possibly won the lambda literary award for 2004 is that it must have been the only gay novel released that year
this is one of the only books i 've ever picked up and absolultely could n't put down until i 'd finished it a real emotional roller coaster at times great fun and at other times devastatingly sad i really , really hope there will be more books by blair mastbaum
i bought this book on a lark , just to use up some christmas gift money once i got the book , i could n't put it down ! the main character is a pissed off teenager , mad at everything , but falling in love and clueless as to what to do sounds like a few teenagers i 've known the great thing about this book is that the description of this teenager 's life rings true the book , like the main character , is not tidy and does n't fit into a neat little package the only thing i did n't like about the book is that it ended too soon
clay 's way is an adventurous tale about a sixteen year old boy who falls in love with an unattainable boy one year his senior set in hawaii , this book has great character development , excellent setting descriptions , and a couple of gnarly plot twists that kept me page turning long past my bedtime though the storyline falters a tiny bit towards the middle , i would recommend it to anyone looking for an honest depiction of those angry and often confusing teenage years you do n't need to be gay to appreciate the messages in this story
an poorly written portrayal of life on oahu involving a 17 year old gay , conflicted surfer and his neurotic , obsessive 16 year old hopeful friend \( \? \) , this book drags us into the terminally boring life of teenage oahu full of shallow character development , cliches , plus narrative and dialogue that is painful , this book deserves the bottom of the the gay adolescent book pile for those teenagers that resonate with this book and its characters , take a very hard look in the mirror if this is life , god , any god , help us all
its fun to hear gay guys talk and this book is no exception unfortunately the behaviors reinforce all negative stereotypes for homosexuals a fun read if appalling
clay 's way is an absolutely wonderful novel , full of imagery and vivid characters i'm in college now , but in rendering his protagonist sam , mastbaum created a character that could have easily been one of my stoner skater group of friends i 'd just like to add that the before mentioned group of people \( painting with a broad brush \) are some of the most accepting people you 'd ever want to meet this is , i believe at least partly responsible for sam 's sexual orientation being a non issue the other reason is that people of my generation are less concerned with identity politics it 's like having brown hair or choosing converse over etnies , it 's just not a big deal anymore clay is a more complicated case , rather than give him any sort of label i 'd say that he is at turns massively confused and in deep denial i would n't say that the sam clay dynamic is entirely sam 's projection i believe that on some level clay really does love sam but that it just was n't meant to be as a favorite teacher once told me when i was asking for boyfriend advice high school is n't where you meet the one anyways in writing clay 's way , blair mastbaum has written a novel that i believe most people of my generation can identify with and i 'll predict it has enough within it 's pages to be value to a future generation
the scripts are buggy and do n't even work out of the box and they certainly are n't well written enough for a production website the contact email address in them bounces , perhaps the author 's gone into hiding in shame
the programs are not really ready to run they are not ready to use programming is required , because there are bugs in html documents and scripts that must be corrected the book is a good resource of information for people who want to study and learn and troubleshoot and learn perl , because it is possible to get the scripts to work if the troubleshooter does not give up until they get things to work satisfactorily i believe that it is practically impossible for a person to use these scripts without having some experience with perl and cgi and html the book has a lot of good explanations of code , which i find helpful and useful i ca n't blame anyone for selling the book in the way it is sold salesmen sell the book programmers who successfully learn , do n't give up when things do n't work easily this is book for beginning programmers
this book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold it is terrible it is a lie ! on the back of my book it says jazz up your site with 20 exclusive , ready to use professional cgi scripts and subroutines no programming required ! it is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand perl , while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone , as it is hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book if you survive through that part of it , you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn perl enough to do things in your own way buy another book find another way
no you wo n't learn from this book because it is a cookbook and like all cookbooks it gives you the recipe even the advance user does n't remember everything and this is wonderful to lookup what you do need you may be able to find the scripts other places but this saves time which to me is money by having them all in one place i have this book sitting with the javascript cookbook and they both get plenty of use ! they make my life easier and i think the book states what it is from the cover you wo n't learn how to from this book but i do n't see anywhere on the book that says you would a wonderful assest
i cannot say enough good things about this book this series is some of the best writing james patterson has ever done ! not only am i totally hooked , but my daughter , grandaughter , and tons of her friends are as well this book has made the rounds through all of us and my grandaughter 's other middle school friends are begging to borrow it as well if you have n't read the maximum ride series yet , please grab maximum ride the angel experiment first then move straight on to this one all i can say is i ca n't wait for the next installment !
i purchsed this book , as well as maximum ride angel experiment i read them both before giving them to my children to read i found them to be clean of sex , language and violence we all throughly enjoyed them and would recommend them to any child who likes fantasy and drama
as an adult , i picked this book up for my daughter and began looking over it in the car before i knew it i had read the whole thing and wanted to read the first book in the series my daughter and i both really liked it , sci fi , adventure , and a little romance thrown in just for fun
i have really enjoyed both books about max that james patterson has written although he has created a unique family due to their scientific beginnings , they continue to face similuar issues that many young people and diverse families face i ca n't wait for mr patterson 's next version of life as only max knows it
after i read the first installment , i passed it along to my 13 year old daughter she has never been an avid reader , but she could not put that book down i ordered this one specifically so she would continue reading over the summer she enjoyed this one just as much after her friends got through reading the books , i finally got it back and found this to be a very entertaining book as well people can not believe that i would give a james patterson book to my 13 year old this is well suited for that age group i highly recommend it
best book in the series yet adults like it as much as the kid
explains how chefs move from running one restaurant to a whole brand , among other things
the class that michael speaks about with the career change students was mine he strolls in i think on day 2 of k 18 with chef theo roe we were told about him coming and being an active participant in our class but mostly would stay out of the way and ask questions for an up coming project he hung with us for a couple of days and we all enjoyed sitting around the dinner table talking about ourselves and he enlightening us with his journey and interaction with chef pardus , who at the time we were not assigned but did eventially get him he stayed in touch with me mostly wanting updates of my cia class clear through graduation i see him on tv now with the likes of anthony bourdain , tom keller and his own show this book , if you read the first one , goes to show how deep food cuts into the soul of a chef he has written other things , pediatric surgery with his sister the surgeon , wooden boats and he always comes back to food he cretainly has my diagnosis of soul of a chef thanks michael for 1st of all putting my name in the book , but also brining to light the cia in the time i went through it was a wonderful time in my life and i know the others felt the same good luck and buy this book if you are reading this review ! reach of a chef buy it
mr ruhlman gives us another perfectly plated culinary tome with his entertaining look inside the world of the celebrity chef phenomenon in america with his usual quirky humor he examines all sides of the 'pop culture of cooking' and what forces make or break chefs in becoming , not just household names , but brands unto themselves
as the co writer of the bellwether of gourmet culinary tomes , the french laundry cookbook , author michael ruhlman has written an eminently readable book that should satisfy any foodie his focus is rife with possibilities as he explores the development of the celebrity chef what ruhlman gleans with carefully gathered insider knowledge is the advent of the chef as an entrepreneur rather than an artisan , a trend that has been discernible for the past decade this has a lot to do with the success of the food network and related lifestyle programming , but also playing significant roles are writers such as ruhlman and anthony bourdain and the simple fact that perceived exotic ingredients are now available at local supermarkets
my first michael ruhlman book was making of a chef it was simply amazing he wrote in such an accessible way that i wrote him a gushing email \( something i had never done \) which he was gracious enough to answer i have since read all of his other books , including boy 's themselves and the french laundry cookbook he has become one of my favorite authors and this latest book is one of his best if you have n't read them , i strongly suggest you read making , and soul of a chef first altough it is n't necessary to take the journey in the order it was written , it is more enjoyable
it 's not that obvious from the outset exactly what trip ruhlman wants to take the reader on , nor if one wants to journey beginning with story of keller of french laundry fame losing his shoes at his new ny ny outing , he begins to unfold the sudden and dramatic shift of what it means to be a chef in this sudden gush of american infatuation with food and a whole new burgeoning generation of foodies certainly worth the read to keep going , especially through cia changes and exotic space age stuff done by achatz in early chapters
although i bought this book , it was really for my husband who 's a cook he 's read it
first let me tell you , i was not the kind of person who read chef lifestyle books i picked up mr ruhlman 's 'the making of a chef' at my local library a few years ago and was enthralled by the day to day lives of cia students described therein i ended up reading all of mr ruhlman 's books , and each one pleased me more than the last this author 's writing reminds me of tracy kidder , another writer who is able through his writing to make the reader visualize people performing their activities in the environment he describes the reach of a chef is a continuation of his discussions on chefs and food , and is a pleasure to read something i should stress i am from south asia , and mr ruhlman 's writing makes me keen to sample many kinds of cuisine he describes in his books he brings the knowledge of good food not only to the people of the united states , but to the whole world ps after reading mr ruhlman 's book the soul of a chef i happened to read kitchen confidential food books , chef books bring 'em on , baby !
yet another impeccably researched and insightful exploration of the world of chefs from ruhlman , one of the very very few non chef writers who get it his look at previously written about subjects and what 's happened to them in the strange new world of chef branding and multi unit expansion and the terrible lure of vegas is thoughtful and on target chefs who famously never open up to ordinary journalists are remarkably candid with ruhlman
a most pertinent and illuminating study
there is so much anti american sentiment worldwide that one is not surprised to find that these strident deniers of all worthwhile things traditionally american are often of the homegrown variety in why the left hates america , daniel j flynn takes the left to task as he analyzes who they are , why they think the way they do , and what the right can say to refute the left 's most egregious charges flynn places current vitriolic hatred of america within an historical context he notes that those who shout the loudest are often the same ones who in the mid 1960s stormed the ivy citadels of columbia university in their protest against the vietnam war those bearded radicals upset far more than the placid decorum of a few harried college administrators over the next few decades they became the new generation of administrators and teachers they wrote books revamping history , taught a brand of history that focused only on america 's acknowledged blighted past and carefully overlooked an unacknowledged glory filled record of achievement flynn notes that the trend toward anti american thought began with the early communist converts of this country in the mid 1920s it was not difficult for these converts to attract the leaders of a series of oppressed minorities to their cause w e b dubois , paul robeson , and lincoln steffens with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , the race toward finishing the job begun by dubois , robeson , and steffens accelerated i seem to recall that it was only then that i began to read about a new source of blame america first the frankfurt school of max horkheimer , erich fromm , theodor adorno , and georg lukacs revamped their then debunked critical theory to criticize american culture from top to bottom flynn does a thorough job of connecting the ideological dots between the early communists , the later neo communists , and the born again critical theorists , all of whom made it clear that in the contest between literal truth and inflexible ideology it must be the latter that had to triumph in fact , a central tenet of flynn 's book is that nearly all of those who shout out that the united states is to blame for all of the world 's real and imagined ills share the common belief that any rumor or discredited theory that vindicates their core beliefs must be accepted as literal truth , regardless of hard evidence to the contrary the reverse is also true any proven fact that contradicts their core beliefs is either conveniently ignored or what can only be seen as a colossal gall that such evidence is admitted to be true but still does not discredit those beliefs
myth 1 american women live under patriarchy
the hate here is the hate that the left seems to have not only for american , but the notion of western civilization in general in the immortal words of a bunch of stanford leftists hey , hey , ho , ho ! western civ has got to go ! it is interesting that the left continually rails against western civilivation and christianity , yet these are the very societies that have created the unprecedented freedoms to attack them from within something the left tries to skirt around at all costs
first , the problematic word in the title the left among the reviews below , you will see considerable disagreement as to who the left is and what the left stands for much of the confusion is that the word liberal and the word left are conflated by many most people on the left and on the right the sad fact is that people in general \( left or right \) do not know what liberalism is and hence do not know the difference between liberalism and leftism some suppose it is a matter of degree a review is not the place to teach fundamental principles of political philosophy you 'll have to get an authoritative book on the subject to find out \( by authoritative i do not refer to pop political polemics , whatever their merits \) to whet your curiosity , i 'll only say that liberalism and leftism , although they agree on social justice , hold totally opposite positions on two other fundamental principles
daniel flynn does a great job exposing the knee jerk , brain dead , and all together perspective free anti americanism that pervades contemporary intelligentsia he starts with a large series of anecdotes that followed 9 11 they consist of mainly stories and quotes from college profs , students , and protesters who blame amerika for the death of nearly 3 , 000 americans that day
if you 're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is evil pathetic wrong or whatever look elsewhere flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point he relies on , for example , what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs look at the footnotes in chapter 4 i'm sorry but this is like looking for a leno 's jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement
i just read this one for the second time and enjoyed it more than i did two years ago dan flynn presents a compelling case that leftists , meaning the far left and not your average democrat , root against our nation whenever possible they are repelled by everything that america stands for and only want to accentuate failures and never successes they are angry at their nation for disproving all of their theories ranging from the functionality of socialism to the misbelief that all cultures are equal this book is fast moving and flynn 's style is very concise he wastes few words and gives us a tome of proof in 213 pages why the left is thoroughly cited and the author takes the time to doggedly show that , while we are not perfect , the united states is far superior to every alternative you 'll be twice as grateful for your citizenship after you finish it
the book does nothing but make a lie of itself there 's no leftwinger that hates america contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you you ca n't keep complaining about michael moore and dan rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as rush limbaugh and dan flynn folks , you cannot complain about the left hating america when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing china and other facist and communist nations to control america 's economy and pretty much everything else of it
the five stars are for the concept which was to write a terrible , formulaic book they succeeded
it 's a terrible book the characters are uninteresting , the motivations are obscure , the machinery is obvious , the sex is strange and unerotic , the writing is terrible but in spite of everything , naked came the stranger is a hoot there 's nothing you can point at and say , this redeems , but the book is so weirdly enjoyable that it really does n't matter read it in autumn , hide it from your friends , finish it in an afternoon one of my all time favorites
since borrowing a dog eared copy from friends who were passing it around a number of years ago , i have not been able to get my hands on this book which became a short lived cult favorite hope amazon com can come through ! under a nom de plume , a group of writers each took a chapter to prove how ostensibly easy it is to write a successful trash novel ! all the talk shows were trying to get the non existent author penelope ashe for interviews ! sexy but outrageously funny ice cubes will never be the same
knowing beforehand that each chapter was written by a different author was what led me to read it \( i had to borrow it from a college prof since it 's so hard to find \) and it in no way hindered my reading ! the book came together extremely well and was a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the intertwining lives of the characters it 's become a staple on my bookshelf for when i just need a good quick read
unless you 're into spamming folks , who filter out junk mail anyway , you wo n't find much value in this book each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email \( spam \) campaign in order to get recognition \( and thus advertise to the reader \)
regardless of some of the negative reviews i found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing some have their opinions about his book about how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich although that has some truth to it , there is so much more to it if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche !
will you learn anything \? yes , dont buy another book like this and waste your money ! every chapter is one ad after another
this book is not only inspiring , it is filled with great and interesting ideas , that work , if you are interested in making money online , i think this is a great investment
if something seems too good to be true , it usually is that 's the case with this book as well it seems that all of these authors in this book are continualy trying to sell each others products no real practical advice is given they suggest making money by building a huge mailing list and selling products to the reciepient through emails first of all , how do we build this magical list , and secondly , who enjoys receiving spam of any kind these days let 's call a spade a spade the only ones getting rich off this book are the authors
a waste of money and time information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it so called expert tips are common knowledge tips for a succesful email 1 be responsive to customers tip2 be honest all times , tip3test tip4 have a good mailinglist tip4 have a good offer or quality product
stale , painfully obvious information from the so called internet gurus full of what to do instead of the more useful how to do information if you really must get this type of info , go to the authors' websites it 's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet for beginners in ecommerce , there 's very little in the way of detailed step by step instructions for people with more experience , there 's nothing new here , just a compilation of articles with the author 's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they 're telling you about
as a website publisher i 've read just about every book on the market 99 gave me general information i could gather for free off the web the remaining 1 were worth their weight in gold this book falls in that category
the e code was an interesting read for general ideas and motivation it 's not a step by step plan on getting rich online , but a rather a good general informational read for internet marketing newbie 's and those just wanting to understand the various approaches to making money online whether you agree or disagree , the book provides a number of approaches and ideas
really nice book , to read and to have as a coffee table boo
i'm in the process of simplifying and optimizing my home 's living quarters i have to admit that i get depressed after looking at other decorating books for instance , where rooms have dreamy coordinating wallpaper , border , paint amp fabrics this is a decorating book that does n't stress me out wishing i had a particular piece of furniture or a million dollars it 's the projects themselves that remind you do n't need to have to go and buy expensive things around the world with a little creativity and some elbow grease , you can pick up items from the local home or fabric warehouse and keep it simple i 'd like to make the folding screen \( p 98 \) from lightweight boards , hinges and casters i may cover them with fabric instead of paint but i 'll probably start with the linen pillowcases \( p 130 \) simply because i 've got the materials for it notice that all the rooms are quite simple the living room has a couch , a couple of chairs , some nesting tables period the projects are light bulbs that go on and make us remark why did n't i think of that \? or that 's what i am aiming for
i saw this reviewed in the paper and bought it mainly because i enjoy local history upon reading it i was very impressed with bell 's work he creates a nice balance between the events and his pursuit of the facts behind the events he gives informative backgrounds on everything from the rural ri communities to tb the book also acts as a folklore 101 course a very enjoyable read
it is a great tool to motive oneself in all types of business i find it very helpful
his presentation is always beautiful and he expounds so well very good for your home librar
in a time when new computer languages are dime a dozen , perl unquestionably retains its beauty keeping with the philosophy of perl there is more than one way to do it the book shows you ingenious ways to work with this powerful language this is a true hacks book and meant mostly for the advanced user before reading this book , i did n't even realize what i did n't know and i rate myself just short of contributing to cpan even if you have read all the popular books perl programming , perl best practices etc you 'll still find a lot of gems
if your a serious perl programmer or a long time perl scripter whose looking to broaden your horizons then this is an excellent book surprisingly , this is really a perl book for professional perl developers , sys admins , and scripters this book avoids parlor tricks like controlling your coffee maker with perl and focuses on how best to make writing and testing perl code quick , easy , and sometimes even fun
perl hacks is an intriguing book which explores specific problems and their quite practical solutions this book is easy to dive in and out of it reads more like a collection of bite sized detective stories rather than a novel
this book is for experienced working perl programmers most likely system administrators but not necessarily that need working solutions to real problems you 'll most likely find in the workplace there are a few diversions into such cute ideas as building animations in perl , but most of these hacks are for the working programmer who is looking for ways to automate processes , build interfaces that do n't get in the way of developers , and thoroughly test and simulate code amazon does not show the table of contents so i review this book in the context of the table of contents
i 've learned enough from the first two chapters along to justify the price of this book even if you are an intermediate perl programmer , this book has various tidbits that will improve your code if anything , i would call this the perl cookbook 2 it may not be as big as the original cookbook , but the recipes in here can save you time and make your code more correct
anne patchett always pulls you into her web , and sinks her teeth into your imagination as you become totally absorbed in her fantastical weaving not as complicated a web as bel canto but equally fun to read
i picked up this book after magician 's assistant i was so excited to read another patchett novel
i didnt think the book was bad until the further i got i could understand why rose decided to leave california i was glad that she decided to keep the baby even when she married son i thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone , including her daughter the fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me i would have loved to see thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that rose touched i almost felt that patchett lost her steam , and found it easier to let rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening at the very least , i would have liked an explanation from rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal as far as being a saint , i didnt see any redeeming quality about rose for that kind of title it was frustrating and disappointing its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth
everyone loves rose , the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book her mother loves her , her first husband , sister evangeline , her best friend , her second husband , and her daughter the only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter , both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother 's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family she is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother she says she misses her everyday so why does she never go back to see her before she dies \? why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her \? rose 's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly , rent a hotel room on the coast , sit on the bed for five minutes , and drive all night to be home to the husband she does n't love by morning it 's idiotic apparently this episode was so much fun to rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes , it was so much fun sounds like a blast she ca n't even carry on a conversation , much less show any tenderness or affection it makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at st elizabeth 's after she leaves because he misses her so much , even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him , and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage also sister evangeline confides in cecelia that she misses rose so much she can hardly bear it why \? she was a humorless , inconsiderate \( to put it mildly \) , cold hearted bore cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother , as she should be , but even she accepts her behavior in the end it was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere , like rose when she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now \? i wo n't read bel canto or the magician 's assistant this book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless
this book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste i trust , but i 've got to say , i just do n't understand its appeal it starts out as mildly intriguing , and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative , but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear , and the narrator of the middle section , salt of the earth gardener son , is not only too good to be true , he 's also deathly boring a dull witted drone i 've read bel canto and the patron saint of liars only confirms my belief that ann patchett 's novels are overrated
this is my first experience with ann patchett and wo n't be my last i loved her writing style even though the character development did n't always make sense why did everyone love rose so much when she was so cold and shut down \? the explanation for leaving thomas , and her mother whom she loved deeply , did n't make sense to me the story however was beautifully written albeit sad i was a bit disappointed in the ending , but i think that had to do with more with finding the lorraine character incredibly annoying i'm anxious to read my next patchett novel
patchett takes the reader through the painfully honest , searingly personal account of how the life of rose an interminable escapist impacts the lives of those around her
check out the 2002 john malkovich version of ripley 's game a marvelous interpretation of an older , wiser , more talented mr ripley much more than the damon ttmr , this one made me want to read the books and what a great read game is very cinematic in the violence and suspense
the others are right it would help to read the first two novels in order to appreciate the character of tom ripley this is important for this installment because this is the novel where ripley almost has a soul he actually undertakes his usual nefarious activity in order to atone for his own malignant action \( first a rumor , then a murder plot \) the characters do n't exactly deepen highsmith 's narrative , but she overcomes the problem of writing a creative mystery by bringing more and more characters into the mix the mysterious reeves minot , who appeared in ripley under ground \( an underrated novel , in my estimation \) , becomes a rather important character and the unlucky pawn in ripley 's game , trevanny , lends the story the closest thing to a moral center that one could hope for oh and the action scenes are relatively plentiful , and exhilirating
ripley 's game by patricia highsmith , opens with the following sentence there 's no such thing as a perfect murder that 's just a parlour game , trying to dream one up an apt statement from highsmith 's unlikely hero tom ripley , but one that also sums up the novel as it begins the third novel in her tom ripley series finds tom playing a nasty prank on an unassuming man , in which he soon finds himself involved in a grisly game of life and death
if you have not yet read the talented mr ripley and ripley under ground \( the weakest of the three first books in the series \) , i strongly suggest that you pursue those books before ripley 's game there 's a continuity of character development that you will miss otherwise
i have to admit , i liked the original the talented mr ripley more , but this was still a fascinating book at what motivates people to commit murder we have a dying man , who slighted tom ripley , and is now fingered by ripley and a friend to go kill some mafia figures money that might not be tempting in ordinary circumstances becomes reason enough at the prospect of dying and leaving his family destitute what i liked was that jonathan did n't jump up to do the murder , nor have a sudden change of heart he was sort of swept up in the whole thing and what is interesting is that tom comes as close to forgiving as a psychopath is capable he did come to jonathan 's rescue more than once a complex game , indeed , with an ending that will keep you guessing right to the end it does leave me wondering , though , how does tom keep getting away with murder
dutch diplomat robert van gulik wrote the judge dee mysteries \( in english ! \) to introduce the west to the chinese version of the mystery story , which arose centuries before the english detective story judge dee is an actual historical person , a magistrate of the seventh century during the t'ang dynasty , who was renown in china for his ability to solve crimes in judge dee at work , van gulik presents us with eight short stories each of a single case \( the novels , in the chinese tradition , involve 3 intertwined cases \) that take place throughout the judge 's long career \( magistrates were usually moved to a new post every three years \) a table at the back of the book , places each case and all the novels within the timeline of judge dee 's life
let 's see ken starr wastes the public money attacking bill clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with kon servative mitch mcconnel of ky to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there are n't any already ! ! ! this book is a perfect tool for neconservative nazis to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by bush cheney rove delay and gop with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend clinton but easily caved into and defended bush the liar in chief !
fantastic collection , fantastic book put together you can truly appreciate gary larson 's brilliance
this was everything i hoped for and more i 've seen countless far sides in my life but there were several hours worth of cartoons i had never seen before , very satisfied
gary larson has a unique way to view the world , and this collection is hysterical ! every far side cartoon ever drawn , in chronological order , is presented in this enormous , 2 volume set if you enjoy gary larson 's bizarre outlook , this set is a must for yourself or for a gift
after checking with customs in norway , i found out that books does n't add tax when bought abroad , and then i decided to buy this complete set of gary larson 's far side gallery ! the books are very well looking , and has a complete set with small remarks from the author on some of the cartoons
if you like smiling \( and sometimes laughing \) , wandering why you had never thought of how things are when they are seen by non humans \( and i'not only speaking of animals but of vegetables and rocks and idiots and my boss , too \) see the world with the eyes of one of the greatest geniuses of humour
i laughed when the cartoons were new , and i am still laughing at them gary larson had a rare gift for creating humor that could border on the bizarre , but was always novel and fresh the cartoons are arranged by the year they were first published the only downside is the heft of the volumes , so they do n't make easy bed time reading
this is a really cool collection ! it is a ton of fun to read , and a ton book to lift \( hey , when was the last time you had a comic book that doubled as a peice of exercise equipment \? \) the binding is beautiful , and tkaes itself very seriously , but not too much
this has always been my favorite comic as i was growing up i lost track of it after it left the papers , and i am sad to say i had nearly forgotten good old gary when i heard about this box set it is amazing i paid full retail for it , but it was still worth every penny this book is amazing , and you will not be disappointed from both the quality of the humor and the essays that provide intersting depth to what the far side was all about , this is a book for completists , leaving out only a small bit of material that was in the book prehistory of the far side also , unlike the calvin and hobbes set , this has high waulity and stays together the pictures are on the materials , not lame stickers that fall off after putting it away once or twice this set rocks , buy it
i 've always been a big fan of the far side i attribute all my knowledge of american culture to gary larson 's creation , as well as mad magazine
this is a great history of social entrepreneurs , military leaders , and other great strategists who figured out how to get what they wanted great short chapters on joan of arc , patton , alice paul and the suffragists , japan , and even picasso and matisse turned out for me to be an excellent source of fun cocktail party chatter but it is a very very good and unusual kind of self help book yes , the book is not about military strategy , but is is about strategy in personal life i thought it was better than a ton of other popular history or self help books it helped me understand how to be more successful at figuring out how to get what i want on the cover general wesley clark calls this a very important book and i agree
the author of tao te ching can never be found out with a hundred percent surety but what is said is important not the one who said it tao te ching is basically a book that has great philosophical depth only religious books like bhagavad geeta , the bible , the quran , the dhammapada come close to tao te ching i personally feel the bhagavad geeta comes closest to this work it is always a good idea to read these books in comparison when you read the books in comparison , you will understand what the books are saying what is clear in one book may not be clear in the other or vice versa or you might find it easier to understand in another book for example , there is a line in tao te ching that says act without action it needs great insight to explain that line the bhagavad geeta speaks of acting without expecting reward it should be understood that lord krishna or whoever wrote the geeta is not talking about philanthropy it is to act from a state where the one who is acting does not exist but the action goes through him and since the actual actor does not exist he is not worried about the result or reward i request you to read the books , tao te ching r l wing 's version is very good the bhagavad geeta paramahansa yogananda 's translation is very good be as you are the teachings of sri ramana maharshi \( penguin books \) i am sure you will never regret buying these books and if you read them properly they will change the way you look at the world
this is a fantastic translation of the dao de jing \( i have others \) perhaps i'm biased because it was the first one that i ever owned and as a beginner in chinese who knows , but i find the expression of concepts very sound , very simple and in complete agreement with esoteric law as i understand it i have used it well over the years and soon will buy my very next copy i'm so glad that it 's still in print as i keep lending it to people who seem to want it more than me
r l wing brings to life this ancient masterpiece the tao de ching is the second most translated book in the world it is a stable of any scholar 's libraries wing has an easy to understand translation that smoothly connects the ideas of the toa with modern physics principles and leadership strategies the work also offers the reader a wide range of historical information about the rulers and has side by side to the text the explanations of the key chinese calligraphy however , what separates this work from others is the insightful commentaries of the author that reveal the underlining premise of this powerful work whether this is your first reading of the tao de ching , or you 're a student of the tao you will be impressed with this work
the tao of power is an awesome book dealing with leadership r l wing 's translation of tao te ching is truely amazing , he provides an excellent interpretation for present day visions i would highly recommend this book to all wishing to be better leaders as well as understand the tao te ching better
this book has a lot of very good material on enthusiasm and goal setting and attitude i highly recommend it for that however , zig gets a little preachy when he starts telling us we should spank children to discipline them , as well as his religious views the final chapter is basically just thrown in to tell you his views the main problem i have with the book is how zig refers to homosexuality as a bad habit and how he equates homosexual literature with pornography if you can overlook his homophobia , you will probably enjoy the book and get a lot out of it
when i first heard zig ziglar , i was not a fan to me , he came across more like a carnival barker i really preferred jim rohn , brian tracy , denis waitley , earl nightingale and so on
this book is intended to improve your self steem , knoledge and confidence to its very roots as you realize those as keys factor to success , it will become mandatory as a reading
i read this book again for the first time \( as an old commercial goes \) and could not put it down zig 's no nonsense , old fashioned approach to success is timeless ! it is a worthwhile book to read for those who want to learn success from the soul outward some may consider the style and manner of this book as trite and arcane but in this day and age of guerilla business tactics this book is a still a breath of fresh air this is one book you will come back to time and time again
more than twenty years ago , this book , along with a great friend from the church played a pivotal role in helping me to turn my life around the book amazingly does help lift a person from the depths of despair and doubt it 's principles are easy to put into practice i found zig zigglar 's style to be entertaining , great fun he makes it easy to stay motivated and focus on the most important principles in life that seem so easily lost see you at the top made me laugh for the first time in such a long time now , i am refreshing my attitude with over the top i got the two tape version that was outstanding so i got the book and i'm not disappointed i always wanted to thank zig somehow , and i should have found a way to do that
if you only buy one book about success this should be it ! zig ziglar is a man of faith and positive vision his philosophy is summarized in the idea that we are born to help others furthermore , by helping others we will be able to achieve our own goals zig writes in an anecdotal style that is delightful and easy to read his writing will challenge you , make you laugh and shine the light of introspection upon your priorities what is it you want to accomplish \? zig will show you the steps of procession that will guide you to the top and to your ultimate life goal i could not more highly recommend this book
this book is very informative of walker evans it shows a wide variety of his work form portraiture to architecture , from the streets of new york to exotic places it not only shows the works of art but also shows short blurbs about the place he was at and what was happening in his life like why he was there and what he wanted out of the photo shoot
i absolutely love these books i have all the 'images of america' books pertaining to my hometown area , and having recently moved to dc , i bought the books about this area they are just as interesting and informative as the others
i ordered this for my boss he said it gave him some direction for a project he is working on

if you are a cio , head of hr , or other so called support function looking for help on how to align with the business , this is not the book for you
alignment is a superb addition to the remarkable series written by professor robert s kaplan and dr david p norton if you have not yet read strategy maps , the balanced scorecard and the strategy focused organization , you should begin with those books before reading this one with each book in the series , you 'll find out more about how to create and use balanced scorecards and your organization will prosper because of it
this book is about organizational alignment it is the fourth in a series of thought leading books on how to translate strategy into actions via balanced scorecard , strategy maps , and the strategy focused organization
great falls , montana , is surrounded by numerous forest fires joe 's father \( joe is the boy narrator of the story \) has lost his job as a golf pro and has gone off to fight the fires while he 's away , joe 's mother falls in love with another man this is the most hemingway ish of ford 's books , and the writing is crisp and clear but there is also a certain coldness and distance from emotions displayed in the prose that 's hard to understand ford is one of my favorite writers on the contemporary scene , so i like just about everything he 's written so far this book is good but not as good as the sportswriter or independence day
at 163 pages , wildlife is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched montana landscape the biggest problem is not so much the story , but the way the story is told in some cases , the impersonal first person narrator works , as in the great gatsby , but in others like wildlife or a prayer for owen meaney , the narrator is such a nonentity that they do n't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other , more important characters
ford told me that this book , really a novella more than a novel , was his last attempt to get out of his system what he began in the montana stories in his collection rock springs , although i would suggest that the montana based story in women without men which had not appeared then continues that what is significant to me about these stories is not the western setting which is nice and full and accurate , or the feelings for the times , but ford 's approach to the question of the myth of parenthood in this book and the stories our characters are faced with the patriarchal myth of the father and the mother as people who can play such a superior role and guide the family safely through the maze of life in capitalism , always being someone to look up to by the child ford brings about explosions , sometimes big explosions in rock springs dad kills a guy in one story and in another story the dad and the son come and find good old mom and an airman in the sack sometimes small and this myth is blown away the child discovers that the parent is a conflicted person with all the problems and humanity that we know , open to disaster , tragedy , and just plain bad luck whether from the parent 's point of view , or the child 's what we see is this myth receding and the acceptance of real humanity by both the child and the parent would that so many of this could have learned all this as wisely in life as ford tells this in his fiction
having read several of ford 's other novels previously , i pretty much got what i had expected and had hoped for no need for outrageous plot twists , chase scenes , or bawdry dialogues the disintegration of this family showed me that people never stop growing , learning , and succumbing to not what is expected but what feels right at a particular point in one 's life
wildlife by richard ford is a good to read , but it also has its twist in the begging of the story it starts of bout a family of three that live in great falls , montana the father jerry was a professional golfer later leaves he 's famil to volunteer as a fire fighter while that was going on the mother , jean , started to have an affair with a man name warren miller who knew her husband the affair that jean had with warren miller was convinced that she was in love with warren miller he didnt feel anything about her her , son , joe was involved in many situations of the affair that the mother had and he also could n't mention anything to the father jerry about the affair one of joe 's intimate experienced was when him and his mother went to warren miller 's house for dinner and she got drunk and she kissed warren in front of joe later his father came from voluteering as a fire fighter for two days jean approached him with the affair she was having with warren miller jerry went hysterical and went to warren 's house and burns the front porch down with joe jean moved out to an apartment without warren miller because he died of cancer that year finally , joe and his father stayed living in the house and worked together in a golf couse
her way is must read for women and men
i loved paula kamen 's first book feminist fatale , which probed the reluctance of young women to call themselves feminist , even though they supported feminist ideas and goals her way is also extremely interesting kamen interviewed lots of young women and argues that they are rewriting many of the old sexist scripts at work , in relationships , in bed she finds them assertive , independent and energetic , with high expectations for equality and intimacy , sexually frank and in control of their lives to an unprecedented extent a well written , optimistic portrait of a generation that does n't usually get such good press
as always dan brown writes lively characters and a quick paced story showcased against a vivid , informative background add a few plot twists and you have a story that reads like a movie thriller if you 've read dan brown before and liked him , you 'll see his usual storyline unfold and enjoy this book
i am yes one of those fans of da vinci code who was just dying to read something else by dan brown first , naturally i turned to angels and demons which was very impressive and encouraged me to find another one of his novels i worried how well his stories would be without robert langdon in them from a and d and da vinci but this novel surprised me
this is a dan brown book but has a feel of a james patterson book it is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous i thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value i enjoyed it a lot but would n't classify it as a best ever
i must say that this book is a very fine piece of work indeed dan brown is an excellent story teller and this book was absolutely marvelous from the first page to the last mr brown must have done an extensive amount of research to write this book since there were many scientific and technological facts included i am not what you might call a very avid reader deception point , however , had me hooked ! this book has many great elements to it thrills , suspense , sexual humor , and humor in general i found myself laughing quite a bit while flipping through the pages of this excellent read ! kudos to dan brown for an excellent story !
i first read angels and demons , after my mother recommended it to me last summer dan brown 's style of writing took me a bit to get use to after that i complete enjoyed the book i promptly went out and bought the da vinci code , digital fortress , and deception point i next read the da vinci code , which i finished just before the movie came out \( took me some time as i was working and going to college 3 nights a week \) i picked up digital fortress 2 weeks ago and finished it last sunday \( app 1 week \) once again a great read then i picked up deception point
just finished reading this book , finally ! as usual , i will give a good bad breakdown of this novel
paco 's story is about young paco sullivan sole survivor of his unit 's ambush , he has returned to the states to look for work left with painful injuries that require powerful painkillers every day , paco encounters both curiousity and discrimination from the locals in the small town he ends up in
this book gives a glimpse into the toll that war takes on those who survive no one but those who endure it can truly fathom the horrors of ptsd , but for the rest of us who want to understand , this book is the best i 've read yet paco wanders through his life finding some solace in washing dishes in a small diner in texas , losing himself in his work and barely surviving mentally from day to day the style of writing drew me into paco 's suffering although it is fiction , it is written by a vietnam vet and left me wondering how many pacos there are among us his story is one that may well haunt you long after the final page is read
this book worked for me i was drawn into a life , a sad unremarkable life on the outside but a life filled with courage and dignity inside paco has a story so horrific , so painful that he ca n't share it with anyone but the dead who haunt him he ca n't escape his experiences or his pain he ca n't comprehend why he is still alive he ca n't relate to those living ordinary lives he cannot share his terrible story he is going through the motions of living on the outside but really living to deal with his inner demons
when i first started this book , i had to put it down for a few days and read something else the rambling device at first put me off as annoying i warmed to the unusual style , however , on the second try and was amply rewarded as a vietnam veteran i can be easily offend with the loser image of a returned veteran but this is misleading paco is severely wounded and simply wants to work hard \( most likely a penitent \) and be left alone he finds his safe harbor in ernest , the owner of the texas lunch diner , where he washes dishes \( washing away his sins , yes yes i get it \) ernest 's ramblings about combat on iwo and guadalcanal add a great coda and understanding heinemann really brings these characters to life , especially the talk about combat and how they feel the most intriguing character is jesse , another vagabond viet vet who stops for dinner as i am also a former paratrooper , jesse 's rantings and observations are priceless pay attention to what jesse says about the proposed vietnam memorial understand scruggs 's idea came about in march 1979 , with heinemann publishing excerpts of this book starting in 1979 \( winning the book award in 1987 \) but cathy gives us a view of how others see us , no matter how unfair that may be cathy at first sees paco as cute then ugly as she observes him night after night with his nightmares what paco reads in cathy 's diary is what many civilians felt about us deep down and their refusal to help in reintegration one final unrelated note one reviewer of this book may be unaware that caputo served in vietnam , whereas clancy never served in the military heinemann is the real deal , with characters very real to me and my experiences
i was never drawn into the story the writing and editing could have been better the distant narrator left me feeling uninvolved , and i never felt or cared anything for the characters for a well written vietnam story that draws the reader in , read the proud bastards
if you 've been there done that you know paco is you and me read it and learn , read it and remember no offense meant just the way it was is peace bebutt1 aol com
that 's how i felt the whole time i was reading this book i loved the sixth sense , really liked unbreakable , sorta liked signs , and hated the village when lady in the water came out , i really did n't have any desire to see it however , when i saw this book in the library , i have to admit that i was intrigued as a writer , i'm always curious as to how others go through the writing process what drives them \? a peek into a creative mind like shyamalan 's was too much too resist
maybe m night 's movie lady in the water did n't make nearly as much as it should have , but he is and will continue to be a real artist michael bamberger 's \( a real artist and true reporter himself \) book the man who heard voices is a testament of m night 's dedication to his craft he tells of the man who has enlightened and revitalized our imagainations with all of his movies sadly people now a days all seem to be film and book critics and are so involved in intellecutalizing creativity right into its grave we need to remember why we go to movies , why we tell stories , why we asked our parent 's to tell us that bedtime story one more time bamberger 's book \( and night 's movie \) do this very thing in fact , they are this very thing
the writing of this book is about as readable as a poor issue of sports illustrated , the book tied in with the release of the movie which was a flop and now warners wants their money back , so as both a media tie in book , and the movie , and the film maker who made it , everyone came out looking like fools
reading the other reviews , i see some people are so admiring of m night shyamalan that anything he writes or directs is a work of creative genius no doubt shyamalan is talented but maybe his fame and fortune came too soon to keep his ego in check i know some of the people mentioned in the book and was curious how their interactions with shyamalan would be portrayed shyamalan is his own number one fan and he has no patience for anyone who disagrees with him or critizes his work he has had a few successful movies and believes all studio executives should trust in him completely i was amazed that shyamalan approved of the book since it shows so much of his darker side shyamalan sets his own rules he can feels he has the right to demand a certain salary but then feels betrayed by an actress who asks for more than the sag minimum he has offered her he loves his family yet does n't seem to accept that a film executive can break his rules by placing her family above work the book is worth a read if you are a shyaman fan or wonder what led up to the disaster that became lady in the water there is no doubt that m night shyamalan is a rare talent with new ideas it is only his ego that stands in his way of even great succes
if you 've watched m night shyamalan 's films and never experienced a sense of deep , soulful emotion and a desire to know the man behind it , stop reading this review now , because this book is not for you but if , like me , you 've been curious about the director with such an intriguing name , boyish good looks , and some truly amazing cinematic moments , then read on , as this book will quench your thirst for knowledge about the enigmatic m night shyamalan
you should read this book if
icky i like mns a lot i like the things he says in interviews , i like his movies i do n't think they are perfect , but they speak to me this book , while an interesting and easy read , is not fun i ca n't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it he has n't really publicly commented on it , other than to say the author had his full support i do n't know it just seemed a weird portrait of someone it seemed over dramatic and vanity fair article esque or like confessions of a shopaholic ew i do n't know what mns is really like or if bamberger interpreted things accurately i just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently
getting a movie produced has always been a somewhat mysterious thing to me the steps from taking an idea to getting a studio , a cast , and of course the money seems to be an almost impossible task
this book is a behind the scenes look at m night shyamalan and the making of his movie , lady in the water
love of knowledge is a very interesting piece of experimental literature not all the experiments succeed \( the short poems and drawings are definitely a product of the time and are for now at least retro cool \) , but all are useful to the reader every gesture tarthang tulku makes in this book accumulates and contributes to a particular effect
bought it for school enjoyed the other books i bought , but this one put me to sleep written more for a professional academic or corporate board member \( i enjoy much more pragmatic books \)
i really enjoyed the book for the most part there are some great topics discussed i especially enjoyed the chapter on nonprofit corporation alliances the downside i thought the two chapters regarding boards were lacking overall , it 's definately worth checking out
this is a great book has everything i need to learn and to know about 3d animation i'm so happy for this book
personaly i find them more interesting and there seems to be more demand for that type of animation in movies and ads
i ca n't possibly say enough good things about this book and its author ! the first thing which struck \( and stuck with \) me is that osipa is an animator first and foremost osipa spoke my language from the first page ! basically , he simplifies the many elements which go into facial animation and has come up with a virtually fool proof yet expandable system based on combining several blend shapes at a time into an extremely flexible series of facial expressions ! previous books either left me marooned with a gazillion blend shape sliders , or otherwise barely explained the process at all in any clear terms osipa 's book concentrates on facial animation as it applies to lip sync and facial acting !
i recently finished a big project that required sync and realistic facial expressions , and reading this book was like being bathed in a pure , heavenly light osipa guides you through the creation of numerous plausible blend shapes and helps you avoid the most common errors before i bought this , i was doing everything wrong the range of emotion that this system is capable of expressing is near total , and certainly enough for any project i can think of short of a major motion picture
this is a great book to get started with it 's a little old , so i'm sure there have been a lot of technical advances since it came out , but the principles are still the same everyone should read this to gain a better understanding of good animation principles they will also gain a good basis for understanding facial animation setups you ca n't lose
it is a wonderful way to get very expressive facial animation
i knew before purchasing that this book was centered around maya , and understandably so , as it is the industry standard however , as a truespace user i found this book to be very useful we ca n't exactly set up rigs and controls the way jason does in maya , but the theories and other ideas presented in the book hold true no matter what application you are using
brilliant concepts and discussion of details , but somewhat slow in painting the big picture he never really comes out and says it , so i will the end result is a control rig for 40 blend shapes , each painstakingly hand drawn and tuned the state of the art does n't allow shortcuts i do n't think it ever can or will if you can accept that all 40 shapes are needed to model the range of human facial expression , this book is for you osipa makes a compelling argument that each is necessary guides you through the modeling to make it possible and wraps up with an elegant rig to control and manage them all the result is a talking head , simply amazing in its range and control of nuance still , 40 heads per character is a huge investment is it worth doing right \? or can you continue to fake it \? buy the book play with the rig and find out for yourself
this book does a great job of tackling the difficult topic of facial modeling , rigging , and animation jason 's writing style is easy to follow and a joy to read his ideas are unique and innovative and presented in a professional , easy to follow way

a good framework for servant leadership style authors drive the point home by hammering three concepts into reader 's mind mindfulness , hope , and compassion however the book fall short on emphasizing the power of serving others , which i believe is a vital ingredient for resonant leaders many useful real life examples
i very much enjoyed drs boyatzis and mckee initial offering with daniel goleman , primal leadership , so i looked forward to learning more about resonnant leadership i certainly was n't disappointed i very much appreciated the author 's attention to citations and footnotes , indications of valid and solid research something that is becoming increasingly rare in these days of making it up as you go writings
intesting book mindfullness , benevolence , compassion , optimism and hope are behaviors that allow leaders to display the very best of their game if you are one individuals who aspire to be a superb leader who helps , inspires and drives results , this book will certainly be a roadmoap to get there
wow ! it 's all new to the conventional biz press and its legions of fans arthur lynch williams has said for decades that any meaningful victory can only be accomplished through 'character' excitement and passion are only required if you want your reports to be passionate and excited great to see the academics now finally on the bandwagon of recognizing truths already gleaned from sport coaching , military leadership , and countless other disciplines and organizational behavior read all you can do is all you can do but all you can do is enough and pushing up people by art williams for the real pioneering work in this field art is a helluvan easier read too , although this work is important for its contribution to the audience it is intended
the resonant leader is inspirational , creates a positive emotional tone characterized by hope , experiences and demonstrates compassion , and is authentic in tune with self , others , and the environment such leaders exude emotions that are contagious and affect all around them top leaders can impact an entire organization these leaders are consciously attuned to people , focus them on a common cause , build a sense of community , and create a climate that unleashes peoples' passion , energy , and unified spirit the authors have studied such leaders and provide examples of how they sustain resonance through difficult times through a process of intentional change and self renewal the book is not only about resonant leaders but how they infuse their organizations with spirit and energy and change them it provides insights , guidance and exercises that inspire reflection research underlying the book 's concepts , ideas and practices is cited and explained the authors have written an inspirational and insightful book with cases that bring the concept of resonant leadership to life this is an important contribution with enduring value highly recommended
organizational behavior and human resources professor richard boyatzis and co chair of teleos leadership institute annie mckee present resonant leadership , a guide to the three key elements mindfulness , hope , and compassion that are critical to enabling renewal and stability in great leaders emphasizing the importance of balance so as to avoid burnout and the precipitation of failure due to exhaustion and excessive stress , resonant leadership is an optimistic yet serious minded discourse about what it takes to be a leader in an increasingly pressurized world a highly accessible guide filled with examples and plain common sense

false memory by dean koontz is a study of terror it delves into the deepest part of an individual 's sub conscious and the complexities inherent
a fan of koontz since i read dragon tears back in 1993 , i would often allow my mom to check out audio versions of his other books for me to read from the library i have not , as yet , encountered a koontz book that i did n't like even the taking , which i can admit was n't necessarily one of koontz 's best works , is one that , when finances permit , i will probably add to my listening library however , i have to say that one of his best works was probably false memory
how many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks , knives and mirrors \? two \? well koontz takes over a hundred , and repeats , repeats , repeats 500 pages should have been cut from this book repetition weakens writing
this novel started out pretty good in that i did n't know where koontz was going with martie 's panic attacks and fear of herself it seemed to take forever for anything to actually happen the antagonist was a caricature so over the top , it was a job getting through each page if this had been my first koontz novel , i probably would n't bother with a second
false memory was the first dean koontz book that i read , and i was enthralled from page one koontz 's descriptions pull you into the story and his suspense is chilling he has a way of revealing information bit by bit , stringing the readers along until we 're snared in his web , desperate for the resolution he does so well
dean koontz writes a tale of deeply penetrating detailed intrigue mind blowing experiences and events occur to various characters in the book which are tied together so intricately that the book is spell binding from start to finish
having read many of koontz 's works , i have found this to be one of his best i am biased , though , in that i appreciate koontz 's use of psychology in his works while many if not most of his writings could be classified as psychological thrillers , this work goes beyond in my opinion koontz has done his research and depicts , in a very real way , the fear and debilitation that a psychological disorder can cause that being said , this book is not recommended for those with a tendency toward anxiety or excessive fear koontz 's writing is very powerful and very real
hello , pseudo intellectual horror novelist ! you are about to get the shock of your life when you learn that i , the preposterously over educated \( thank you very much , dean , i appreciated that one \) mark ahriman is not dead , never died , and wouldn't think of dying before running my evil nemesis and his first and last born sons into the grave for writing horrible reviews of my well received and 78 weeks on the bestseller list how to love yourself though seemingly wasted by the gun toting billionaire twit and keanu phobe , i , like skeet , dusty 's half brother \( who i thought i 'd finished off on the beach \) , was wearing a kevlar vest as if the great ahriman could be erased as easily as that neither by white out nor the nib of a no 2 pencil , with which , i am certain , you , herr koontz are admirably supplied no , no , no , dear novelist to the middle brow i have also decided to stick around to help you overcome being second place to that new england bumpkin \( you know who \) whose stupid , working class creations have always sold more copies than the yearly mass consumption of toilet paper , and whose formulaic , soporiphic stories seem always to be being made into films and tv mini series i know you pretend to call him friend , dear writer , but we both know you 've been seething for years over the inequity that a low life potato eater from maine is the no 1 horror writer in america , and not you the word smith we all know you to be here 's a test haiku for the amazon site of his latest book i 'll program him to fail i 'll never be as good as koontz i'm crushed under the weight of his indomitable prose god help me ! or something like that let me know what you think as i dawdle here under the awning of la junquette riche , my favorite french boite , downing a chocolate croissante and a yoohoo , i ca n't help wondering why these imbecilic reviewers did n't notice that false memory is screamingly funny \? it 's hard to be a sadist in a world of self mutilators well , that one sure cracked me up , and as you know , i'm usually the one doing the crack up anyway , as i always say down with the tofu police , up with homicidal snobbery , and onward forever with great writing starting with how to love yourself , of course do n't count me out we need a sequel !
i could not put this down just as riviting as koontz 's intensity if you like psychological thrillers , this one is for you it 's unbelievable how this professional psychiatrist uses the mind control skills he 's perfected on patients he treats characters are extremely well developed loved this one be afraid , very afraid , next time you see your shrink
although freud 's ideas and psychoanalytic theory have n't fared that well in recent decades \( jung 's views and reputation have actually done much better \) , there is no doubt that freud 's ideas were a major contribution to the understanding of human behavior and the mind and remain at least historically important today although perhaps superceded by the cognitive and neurobiological approaches that have developed in the last few decades , freud was still a brilliant thinker who changed our undestanding of the mind for the better
this book is a watershed in human intellectual history in it freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason , and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes , our inner unconscious lives dreams are not nothing , and they are not in freud 's eyes rare religious gifts , but rather to the key to our own mental life freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations
freud 's the interpretation of dreams is a unique book his treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind but neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book the great achievement of freud 's theory is its immunity to criticism in other words , it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book his main tenet a dream is a fulfillment of a desire cannot be attacked in any intelligible way if one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire , freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment or , if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled , he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished , viz the desire to destroy freud 's dream theory
sigmund freud has done an amazing research in the field of dreams and their meanings , you will be amazed how every single detail in the dream has a meaning \( according to sigmund freud not that i agree with him \) and it is very impressive personally i enjoyed this book very much
as a student starting law school i thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class , boy was wrong the book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student it is however , very basic in its approach and gives you a good start , so it is not a total waste , the subtitle says that the book is for non lawyers , as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun my recomendation is , that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book , but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer , trust me it is well worth the fees among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list , in the case of lexis nexis and west law require very expensive memberships and that most law schools restrict the use of their law library to students in their law school and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the law library , as the law students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the library and legal librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome
jean donaldson is one of the world 's foremost experts on how dogs learn and how to teach them her methods are humane , based on the well studied science of behaviorism , not stressful or harmful to dogs , and very , very effective
easy to read , clear and sensible advice given in response to 'real life' scarios and dog problems
if you liked ms jean donaldson 's first book culture clash you will like dogs are from neptune in fact , i would suggest that this book is a necessary follow up
excellent resource book that should be a part of every dog owner 's reference library handles all phases of dog training from aggression to submissive urination question and answer format works well arlene millman , author of boomerang a miracle trilogy \( the tale of a remarkable boston terrier \)
i love dogs are from neptune and culture clash , both by jean donaldson this expert trainer is also a thoughtful and engaging writer by really moving into and explaining the mind of the dog , donaldson goes beyond a training how to instead , she gives me , as the trainer of my own dogs , the tools i need to figure out how to solve my own training problems it has caused me to think about my dogs and how i train in a whole new way if i was n't training my dogs , i 'd still read these books because they make me laugh \( a lot \)
i love the real life questions that are answered in such wonderful detail the amount of information that is in this book makes it a must have for any dog trainer or person with a dog
this book is a collection of q amp a 's where donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems although some generalizations can be made from the problems included , it 's hard to know how to generalize i e whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case this means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog 's behaviour if you have a serious problem , do n't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes
the best thing you can do for your dog is to read this book and read culture clash also by jean donaldson i know dogs , and i know training and i love dogs , and i love training yet i 've never come across a more fantatsic dog knoweledgeble trainer ! and talk about laymen 's terms ! these are the dog books for all levels of dog lovers

series of unfortunate events book 5 the austere academy
dear reader ,
jesus gomez
you think that the children will be better off now that they are in an orphanage but beware it only gets worse for the childen that you have learned to care about thanks to snicket 's great story telling abilities
i love this one because they haev to go to school and count o is the gym teacher adn makes them run for a very lond time and is a great boo

from abc 's 20 20
now where 's the old john stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses \? guess he thought it 's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice for all his ramblings in this book , he might as well blabber on the emmy awards and get lost ! let 's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds
for all the talk stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate , he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at abc the only reason stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior for all that he claimed to expose , it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt
i love john stossel 's 20 20 shows , and thought this would be a good book boy was i wrong this was an awesome book ! i think the reason why is that stossel gets to say exactly what he wants , without being edited or censored , and without time limits
of course stossel can talk big about busting them liberals but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them ever wonder why abc hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths \? ever wonder why stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks \? this and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad
reading this , you understand how john stossel had the scales fall from his eyes and he began to question , rather than just accept this seems to be a rare characteristic in a journalist today well written , you will also find yourself wanting to look a little closer to the facts of a story
first he says he cracked down on all those liberals but yet he admits to loving their evil ways if this is as wishy washy as he can get , no wonder he and sam donaldson get along ! you ca n't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same liberal media if he were working as a farmer in idaho for instance , he 'd have more credibility but i'm not so sure stossel says what he means
it 's been interesting to watch the transition in john stossel 's politics over the years his ideas mirror many of my own i started out as a left liberal and have been increasingly moving towards a more libertarian position i 've also received a lot of flak for that , especially in the women 's movement where i was active for decades
i love this book as a geek , i 've watched the events that friedman writes about occur he has captured the events accurately , but this is not a dull history book friedman is a masterful story teller
this is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about globalization and how the world economy is moving to a new age of information sharing most of the old regimes will change as borders open up and people are able to use the internet to spur economic progress thomas friedman has a very entertaining style of writing so i recommend this book quite highly
i just finished reading friedman 's book and feel it is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the rapid changes effecting our world
it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat , then do n't waste your time
not only you must read this book , but you need to give conference about this topic and give copy of the book to everyone you know if you wa n't to understand what 's happening in the world right now , read this book
this book shows you many things that sometimes you are not aware of it was a nice reading
this book is an essential for anyone interested in economics i highly recommend it , also if you like this book freakenomics is another interesting read
i enjoyed reading this book the author has a firm understanding of the effects of globalization in the world today i strongly recommend this book
granted , world is a great bunch of stories about how our global community has become flattened but unfortunately for friedman , the book is already outdated that 's why the recent 100 page update was necessary , but a book on the history of such a changing landscape is quite like a detailed drawing of the mona lisa on an etch a scetch , which someone keeps shaking up i'm not saying it 's impossible to give a detailed description of what 's going on in the world today in a book format , but maybe some of the things that the author described in his book \( open source ssoftware and new web applications like blogs and user drivn web content \) are the only way to really get the updated version of our history there 's nothing like a printed book , but perhaps that media cannot fulfill the needs of a modern history
this book is a must read to anyone wanting to understand the times we are living in friedman does a great job explaining how the world is opening up to capitalism and how the 300 million of us in the west are being joined by 3 billion from the east in our markets with the berlin wall coming down on 11 9 1989 and the internet going up on 8 9 1995 the world has changed we live in world that is flattening due to technology people around the world are empowered by cell phones , personal computers , and web sites the chinese have opened up to capitalism and are now producing things cheaper than mexico indian students are graduating and doing tech work for america in india , then emailing it to the us the countries of the old soviet union are eager to participate in capitalism with the west america must upgrade or jobs as they are lost to other countries , but we must realize that there will be many future jobs created with the these countries developing their own consumers and middle class what will american corporations profits look like with an extra 3 billion customers over the next 30 years \? this book teaches us to embrace collaboration and competition through out the world we will all be better off in the long run with lower prices and higher standards of living , if we adapt to the changing world why is wal mart the cheapest retailer in the world \? chinese labor and logistics while the arab world , africa , and most of latin america are being left behind , china , india , and the old soviet countries are gearing up to join the west , while currently only 2 of india and china are developing into their own middle class , the potential is incredible this review can not do justice to the book , read it for a preview of the 21st century prepare for change
love 's labors lost is one of my absolute favorite shakespeare plays it 's completely hilarious , but still has shakespeare 's amazing way with words in love 's labors lost , the bard has created a highly amusing tale of men and their problems keeping oaths especially when women get on the scene
this merry play is a delight for its language it has more a situation than a plot the king has sworn himself and three attendants to three years of fasting , abstinence from women , study , and little sleep immediately a princess arrives with her attendants that cause the men to regret their oaths letters are written , delivered incorrectly , and a huge final scene with disguises , masks , and a wonderfully strange presentation of some of the nine worthies all of this provides a structure for a rich play of language that is full of wit and bawdy
first , i should note that the wealth of networks is terribly edited given that benkler thanked his editor for his herculean work at the beginning of the book , i can only imagine the state it started in as it is , it ended with glaring grammatical errors , including using effect when he meant affect and wave when he meant waive \( i 'll provide specific examples sometime tomorrow \) editing , apparently , is a craft that is only noticed in its absence i did n't realize this until i read the wealth of networks by the time i was done with the book , i was copyediting every page

i have worked with some of the new web 2 0 products and felt unease at explaining how they fiteed into the 'selfish' model that we associate with economics benkler explains this without sounding hippyish or marxist a good read
professor benkler discusses the idea of social production , goods being produced by communities rather than corporations , as a third way to think about development he also discusses the affects that social production will have on the status quo , and in particular , intellectual property laws his is a methodical and extremely well researched argument that will leave you thinking about what the 21st century may bring
this book is very funny , weirdly prophetic and difficult to read if you 've got 8lbs of baby pressing down on your bladder
i have always been a fan of dave barry
just not funny , i returned the book and got my money back
i read this book when it first came out and lost it when a friend did n't return it this a fascinating book and since it was first published sars and bird flu has entered our world if you are prone to panic attacks or nightmares do n't read this book because the author did a fantastic job at research and has revealed our future and the diseases that will alter it
this book is superb for a number of reasons but the meticulous research behind it really stands out there is not an idea or suggested proposition that is not referenced to one and sometimes mulitple sources the tentive conclusions that are laid out are suggested only after exhaustive research and tightly logical arguments
this book is a very long read , but the details and the descriptions make it unbelievably entertaining and educational
this large but highly readable work covers the history and context of emerging or re emerging communicable diseases affecting the world today as a physician with a masters in public health i could appreciate the challenge this author faced in presenting this complex and important topic she has made remarkably few minor technical errors while presenting fields as diverse as virology , immunology and disease ecology in a clear and compelling manner she places the emerging diseases in the social , economic and political context that helps to explain why diseases occur where and when they do and why and how they impact individuals and societies although the jacket copy seems to imply a sensationalized account , the story the author tells is a balanced and highly professional one in a world grown ever smaller and more tightly connected the issue of communicable disease and public health will impact all our lives and deserves the attention of every citizen
scares me more than any terrorist , earthquake , comet or meteor from space ever could !
you want to be truly frightened about your health \? read the coming plague newly emerging diseases in a world out of balance by laurie garrett a friend loaned me his copy of this book after i had read a book about the flu epidemic in the early 1900 's this book , written in 1994 , covers a number of diseases from all over the world , as well as the stories of the individuals who constantly risk their lives to combat the deadly viruses
i read this a few years ago and re read it last month it gives a very compelling view of microbes and their evolution and how humans have responded to these threats
laurie garrett is an excellent writer , she could easily had made this book a novel , as a matter of fact she almost did with her great detailed narrative she makes you fell inside the history of the modern microbe hunters , i 've read several other book in this subject and none of them treats the subject in the professional and journalistic way garrett does you can easily detect she knows her business , the concepts and the way she makes them all make sense is laudable
beautiful narrative style shows the history and the politics behind some of the most deadly bugs out there want to know about the diseases up to 1995 , then this is it huge notes section with indepth index all this packed into 750 pages
i just started reading john grisham books and find them to be exciting and hard to put down
wow ! i have read a few grisham books , and i have to say that this is the best one i have read thus far he drags you in very quickly with mitch , the main protagonist in the story he tells about this background and the sudden riches he has he seems to have it all a great job , a beautiful wife , a nice home , a great car , and living in a wonderful city only one problem he finds out later how unsavory his employer is
this was the first john grisham book i ever read and it was the best non stop action , suspense and thrills you cannot put it down a for sure recommendation
this is a dramatic and tense story of a young law school graduate who gets a job offer that is too good to be true of course , it turns out that he does n't get the full story until after he accepts the job the rest of the story entails the exciting efforts to get him and his wife out of their desperate situation like most grisham novels , this is a fun and fast read that many readers would classify as light fiction
i agree with one the comments posted below the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one dimensional character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him over the course of the book he does n't change , he 's unsympathetic , and by the time we 've reached page 500 , we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10 i found myself dying to get to the end of this book , just so i could start another book with some substance and some well drawn characters
the firm is a very interesting book that will grab you from the very beginning and keeps you going until the very end mitch mcdeere is fresh out of college with his law degree from harvard accompanied by his loving wife , abby mitch is recieving tons of job offers because he was ranked third in his class at harvard after careful consideration mitch decides to take a job in memphis that pays a lot of money what both mitch and abby thought was a god law firm turned out to be the place that could ruin their lives they haved to perservere and try to secretly get out of this law firm without being killed they are very upset with their decision to work at this law firm but will do anything to get out of this very mysterious firm
in the service profit chain , the author uses extensive case studies and empirical data to demonstrate how successful companies can achieve customer satisfaction , employee satisfaction , and at the same time , profit and customer growth too many companies are focused on the next quarterly earnings release that they do n't ever see the lifetime value of their customers finally , managers at service industries wo n't have to keep trading off employee satisfaction in order to achieve customer sastisfaction , and customer satisfaction wo n't be viewed as a cost factor and a drag on profit growth service companies that just do n't understand these concepts wo n't be around for long ! as we embark into the e commerce age , service and technology companies that can quickly apply these concepts within their business models \( where there is no direct , face to face , contact with the customers \) will build a truely competitive advantage let 's review the successful ecommerce companies in 5 years , and see how many have adopted the principles in the service profit chain
i think the authors provide a powerful and empirical approach to designing and analyzing a service organization for success the recommendations are not always intuitive nor easy to implement , but , based on my experience in several industries , i think they are nearly always correct with a partner , i am starting a own company and have read this book twice very carefully , with lots of notes in the margins , to make sure we do the important things well
this is the type of book that can change an entire corporate vision the authors are meticulous in presenting their philosophy , and back every word with carefully researched examples from best practice companies unlike many of the quick read publications that present a superficial view of service \( particularly from a marketing perspective \) , this book is clearly the result of several years work in the field every corporate manager who is serious about customer value management needs to take some time out to study the service profit chain
when i began to read viktor e frankl 's book it felt like being in a dream this is one of the few books which i read all at once i just could n't stop reading it , started with the first word and finished it with the last one
the dramatic story frankl relates is hard to believe but is true how he managed to learn something so positive from his horrible experience is truly inspirational i give this book to anyone who is suffering in life because it so clearly teaches how to overcome any obstacle
viktor frankl was a distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist and the founder of logotherapy he was also the 32 books which were published in 32 languages
this was a really great book
i was assigned to read this book for a class called psychology intro to counseling , theory and practice the book talks about frankl and his meaning for his life , how and what he found meaning in while in the concentration camps it is an existentialist writing about his experiences he grew , he learned , he made choices , and lived life for himself , even under the guise of imprisonment the fact that any one man can find meaning in all of this is amazing i really wish i had the chance to meet krankl and speak with him it is a powerful story and a great theory logotherapy is worth of even the most devoted freud fan
this is an easy to read book , which managed to make profound points about life , pain , and fate i enjoyed reading the first part of the book and learning about what it was like to be in such a hellish place \( a concentration camp \) , and yet still being able to be positive about life what more can i say than its an excellent book
man's search for meaning
this is simply a must read for those interested in the human experience some of the positions concluded in this book may not be the only way to think on the issues involved , but still , this book is a great psychological workout with deep insights
frankl , who survived the concentration camps , writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile rather , one should be worthy of one 's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism , bitterness and despair he uses poetic , moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth clenched self preservation though not specifically religious , this masterpiece has a religious purpose to help us find meaning this book succeeds immeasurably
amazing book , gives the reader many things to comtemplate the reader will be a better person for reading this book written by one of the most important people of his era viktor frankl is someone everyone should meet through this works
this is a book i now keep in mind for my soon to be new mom friends just in case , that along with the numbers of womens' clinics at various hospitals and health centers that treat post partum depression
this book actually helped me put into words what i was experiencing with postpartum depression
i had mixed feelings about this book i admire brooke shields for writing it yes , she has a lot of advantages most women who suffer ppd do n't but the feelings she describes are valid she does n't flinch from discussing thoughts of suicide or her visions of seeing her baby injured these are shameful feelings for anyone and when you are in the public eye admitting you have had them is inviting an attack i think it was a brave thing to do
so , poor brooke shields felt unhappy \? so what \? is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty , who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation \? is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year \? and all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself of all the times in one 's life , the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby , yet still she could n't feel her own baby 's love for her how pathetic
yes , much of the book was spent explaining how difficult it was for brooke to become pregnant perhaps it was explained to demonstrate how badly she and her husband wanted a child , only to have brooke feel the complete opposite once her daughter was born i read this book while suffering from ppd brooke 's words were my words , she was speaking for me , when i could not articulate my thoughts , and was afraid of myself i finally had faith that i would not be the excepton and that even i could overcome ppd also good reading is conquering postpartum depression by dr ron rosenberg he 's a dedicated doctor
brooke shields has done an excellent job painting a picture of one of the negative possibilities of the postpartum experience though it took her a while to get pregnant , her pregnancy was wonderful so it can be very surprising to read how difficult her experience was after the birth of her daughter rowan
i 've heard good things about this book so i was honestly expecting to like it however i really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive and because it was written by brooke shields , the book sold but really , if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere
brooke sheilds takes the reader into her own private eye view of the world through the eyes of a mother suffering from post partum depression she is amazingly truthful with all that she has gone through who wants to tell someone , much less the world , about thoughts of harming one 's own child \? how do you get help for that \? without someone thinking you need to be institutionalized \? that fear alone , keeps a mulititude of women from seeking help for this debilitating disease brooke allows herself to be put up before judge and jury , and for that , i truly admire her and her book of confessions she is a strong woman who has dealt with and beat , ppd i highly recommend the book , especially if you are in need of a sense of comradery brooke lets you know that you are not alone in your suffering and gives you hope with a sense of comfort and understanding , that only one who has suffered from the disease itself could possibly offer
i'm a ph d and gay , coupled for 18 years we have twins via surrogacy \( our daughters are now 10 yes , they are simply lovely \) i completely applaud brooke 's frankness and honesty of her horrid struggle through what i , as a man , have not undergone as a 16 year old , i left work early \( as a pharmacy typist \) to see blue lagoon a fan , i suppose ! hearing brooke on cd is quite shattering to one 's soul as well thanks so much , brooke your honesty and integrity are highly appreciated
for anyone who has ever suffered from postpartum depression , this book is a must read as a mom of an almost 2 year old , i too suffered from ppd while reading all of the pregancy books , i skipped all the chapter about ppd and laughed out loud who would be depressed after wanting a child for so long and finally getting their wish was i in for a rude awakening ! brooke shields book hit home in it , she is both funny and honest about everything that happened to her , from her bouts with infertility through her pregnancy and ppd and afterwards when her sun came out there is not enough emphasis on this subject she tells of her struggles with infertility , miscarriages and her wonderful pregnancy she did n't come off as a celebrity who has someone else caring after her child she is a hands on mom who happened to have suffered from ppd you can feel a connection and i am so happy for having read this book kudos , brooke shields
i was going to assign this book to my students in my abnormal psychology class the first chapter is powerful and true however , this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children 's illnesses ! ! ! ! he also attacks nami , the national association of the mentally ill , an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover , find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life , and has truly educated more people about mental illness than breggin has ever done himself , i am sure the good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are , in my opinion , obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents attacks , i believe , that may be a result of his old fashioned psychoanalytical training
some people think they are so smart that they know everything about these drugs and chemistry , no matter how smart you are and lets say youre 1 top psychiatrists in the world if you havent taken the ssri yourself and experienced the damaging affect of these drugs , you cant say anything period not even if you invented the drug ! ! ! ! ! why do we have so many people complaining about these drugs \? duh maybe because there is a problem and causing problems ! ! ! , people who havent tried or experience the damaging affects afterwards dont see why people are complaining we dont see books about warning people not to take for example flu shots do we \? no i used to be one of those people who believed and that popping a pill can solve my life problems but now because of ssri my life is ruined and have permanant problems that wont go away and for people who are currently on ssri , pills will never ever cure depression unless you stay on them forever , im sure you are happy with those fake smiles , see what happens when you taper off of them and people who are for these drugs should immediately go to doctors and try them and see how safe they are i recommend you try prozac first if that dont work out dont worry there are plenty others that doctors will want you to try hahaha so sad that there are still people out there in this country that really believe these pills can help them
having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years , i can assure those who swallow breggin 's nonsense hook , line and sinker that nobody could have talked me back to anything resembling health the mental anguish i suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long financial and insurance considerations aside , talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results
i could n't resist writing this the ad hominem abusive , straw man , slippery slope and other fallacies running rampant in some of the other reviews are just ridiculous !
the 1 december 2005 reviewer misunderstood everything the reviewer implies the book is new but breggin wrote it fifteen years ago
do any of you positive reviewer even know that dr breggin does n't even see patients anymore \? that in nearly 2 years all he has done has traveled the country to testify in courts against psychiatrists \? that is , in states which have n't yet discredited him for being biased and unscientific i find it amazing that a man who has n't treated a psychiatrist patient in years can write a book so skewed and wrong that it can endanged the public and still be published what bothers me more is that people think he 's correct modern medicine does not know the reason that the pancreas produces less insulin than normal , they only know that it does , so maybe diabetics should stop taking insulin and try to figure out if they were raised improperly by their mothers sound crazy \? of course , but this is the message that he 's advocating he should be ashamed of himself he is not a real doctor and should return his diploma edit 12 21 05 take about misunderstanding karellen 's comments above are typical of those attacking something they know little about , making me wonder if karellen believes in aliens like tom cruise i said nothing about when the book was written and that is irrelevant to the point of the review which is that breggin 's opinions are so biased that he has been discredited by state courts in this country i was trying to avoid posting websites , but since you posted one i 'll post one too http www quackwatch org 11ind breggin htm
biological psychiatry is a perfect pseudoscience and toxic psychiatry is one of the best books that debunk it i strongly recommend this book , peter breggin 's manifesto , to anyone interested in mental health the negative reviewers simply do not address honestly breggin 's arguments
as a behavioural neuroscientist i was appalled by the extreme and unscientific rhetoric expressed by this individual the fear mongering nature of this read provides an extremely biased point of view by throwing psychiatric techniques at the reader that are either out of date or have been changed to better the patient \( s \) involved a mental state is a direct result of a particular brain state , and therefore , a disturbed continual mental state creating dysfunction in the individual must be a result of altered neurochemicals and must be corrected through proper medications if the author knew anything of neuroscience and psychiatry he would understand that medications and psychotherapy are the best combination , and not one alone
i'm glad there is a book out there that states the dangers
a well researched and documented book by a smart guy with a real passion for his subject and compassion for the people impacted his book your drug may be your problem might be a good running start to get up to dealing with this sizable thing it is an outstanding gift to patients as they are never told this stuff nor are their lved ones
this book is more than just a hiking narrative , although it is that listening to bryson read his account of his appalation trail hike , you become immersed in his life you can almost see the forests , feel the breezes , enjoy the mountaintop views , and hear the wildlife you also become well acquainted with bryson , his hiking partner stephen , and many fellow hikers on the trail , and it is often very funny he also brings in a lot of the history , geology , and ecology of the regions he travels through i believe that the listener will find himself or herself very enriched by this well written work
the book moves , is enlightening , funny , and educational if you have ever walked in the woods , it might not look the same again
a charming piece that makes it all but impossible to read quietly mr bryson shares his experiences , lessons and insights about this challenging appalachian trail hike he undertook with such drole humor we found ourselves giggleing on almost every page and stopping to share wonderful humor at least a few times a chapter my sister did this with mom and my husband and i did it to each other despite the plan to read it ourselves went straight to amazon com to find his other works
any book that challenges and engages a high school student is well worth the price
first let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail he does not he hikes less than a third you dont find this out until 2 3 through the book , which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad , to an ill effort to fulfill a contract
i rarely read a book twice there are just too many to read to have the time to read any twice however , i was reading an article the other day about the appalachian trail and i remembered this book that i had read years ago and was now on my book shelves with all the others i remembered it as an extremely funny , yet poignant book
r stockwell was right on in his review bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book , constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself his favorite targets are southern whites a typical description is loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex ! ! ! how would a reviewer \( of the nyt , for example \) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner city youths as crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman neither of these passages are acceptable but bryson belongs to that ilk who 's motto is bigotry for me but not for thee bytw , his earlier book , lost continent is even more egregious with his kind of self righteousness it 's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff
returning to the us after living in england for twenty years , bill bryson becomes intrigued with the idea of the hiking the appalachian trail , a portion of which is in his new hampshire backyard the 2100 mile trail from georgia to mt katahdin in maine winds through virgin forest and scenes of incredible natural beauty and provide an unparalleled opportunity to be alone and reflective
this may be my second favorite bill bryson book behind sunburned country as i said in his forum , it's beyond belief that he and his overweight friend good old katz walked as far as they did in the wilderness and survived it is a wonderful , relaxing , edifying , laugh riot of a book as only bill can provide i love his work and trust me , buy this , you won't be able to put it down even reading about the dangers you'll feel like immediately going for a hike somewhere one warning , take a lot of bill's history with a grain of salt he tends to bend the facts a bit for a laugh and his history of thomas j jackson \( stonewall \) is just nonsense , but very funny in fact , jackson was probably the most brilliant major officer the united states ever produced and he , not robert e lee was the stategist in the south's greatest victories but i digress , bill bryson is my hero and for heaven's sake i'm a republican and he detests republican's so you know i find this man funny go bill
jaques offers a number of fast dishes that taste like they 've been cooking all day the recipes are easy to follow and brought a fresh new taste to my kitchen i frequently turn to this book both on a busy weeknight after work and a lazy sunday afternoon the book is a companion to the tv show that currently airs on public television it is by no means all inclusive but certainly worth having in your kitchen pick it up
this book wo n't turn me off to jp , who i admire very much for his style of cooking and pleasant personality but the book was a bit boring once i gleaned the book , my usual how can i decide what to cook first \? did n't hit me i picked up the book again with the same results just not enough inspiring stuff there i have n't looked at the book since so i ca n't even say this or that recipe was lackluster i only remember my response to the book it wa n't the 'fast food' concept either because everyone needs quick recipes in the cooking repertoire i cook a lot i'm not a cookbook collector my cookbooks are stained and tattered i'm afraid fast food my way will remain in pristine condition until i can give it to someone who will assign it more value than i can each book i have on the shelf has to carry its weight or it 's off to the pantry my culinary siberia for cookbooks where this cookbook now resides for some reason i found jp cooking from this book on tv much more pleasurable than entertaining the idea of cooking from this cookbook
this is a great cookbook to have especially if you 're following the tv series on pbs it has simple and complex recipes , good pictures , and delicious recipes jacques pepin is a great chef this would be a great gift
this book is phenominal ! i made the zesty pork chops the other night quick , easy and made it for friends who all said wow ! i want this recipe !
i 've long admired pepin and have several of his earlier books this newest book \( and pbs series \) brings us his approach to fast food which i think is meant with a wink and a smile it 's only fast in the time sense ! i'm a serious foodie and this is real cooking equally useful for family meals or entertaining
this is the best cookbook , in my opinion , for those of us who have busy lifestyles but still prefer delicious home cooked meals i have given numerous copies of this as gifts and the recipients have all been appreciative i have tried 75 of the recipes , which is amazing in itself , and only one dish was disappointing i own many of jacque 's cookbooks and this is the one i turn to time and time again happy cooking
i absolutelly love this book i love to cook and love good food unfortunatelly like many i do n't have the time , expecially with a new baby that requires my attention constantly this book has been great i use it practically every day the recipes are easy to follow and they are delicious i love his show also and record it every saturday if you like good meals but do n't have the time to spend the whole day in the kitchen get this book , it is definetely worht every penny
gorgeous , four color book stuffed with easy , delicious recipes every time i cook one of these deceptively simple dishes , i ca n't believe that i made anything so delicious ! or that it came out so perfectly ! thank you , jacques
first off , you just ca n't top jacques pepin he just makes you comfortable about cooking no matter your skill level i bought this book after watching his pbs fast food my way series all of the recipes are easy and quick many of them can be done with things you already buy most of the time and he often tells you items that can be supplemented for example , the instant vegetable soup \( which is awesome \) lists one defined recipe but the accompanying description tells you how it can be made into a variety of other , quick soups with things nearly always on hand , like potatoes , onions , and cheese the tomato tartare has become a weekly staple in my home everyone loves it cilantro walnut cod , egg tomato gratin , quick tenderloin stew were easy and turned out fabulously the warm chocolate cakes are the easiest i 've ever made this book is n't a mega source of recipes but the ones that are in it are quality i'm just an average home chef and have had a great experience with every recipe i 've tried all were easy and tasty i only wish i could mince an onion like he does
i saw the program and after years of making the same traditional laborious recipes \( e g chicken pot pie \) , was surprised with fantastic techniques of making marvelous looking and delicious tasting dishes in much less time
this book is not for everyone if you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that \( such as long winded language that seems outdated to us today \) , then you should stay away
note to all first time readers this book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula i read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it journey to the center of the earth is also a classic , but i prefer this well written , with a unique story and good visuals throughout the reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the nautilus captain nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers in this one will see man vs man , and man vs nature for some the descriptions of various marine life may seem over done for me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made captain nemo tick mr verne 's book deserves the appelation , far ahead of its time
having chewed and digested around the world in eighty days , five weeks in a balloon and journey to the centre of the earth , i set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of verne the often overlooked true father of science fiction with much relish sure , 20 , 000 leagues seemed bigger than the others i 'd read , but i thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of verne all the way well , i was nearly right
20 , 000 leagues under the sea was a very complex book the authors word choice was what made it so complex , the author used words like vexed zoophytes and connoisseur the majority of these words were old english , which added to the complexity of the book the sentence structure was similar to the word choice , it was also very complex sentences , the sentences were usually not to long but not to short , at times they could be quite long though , and they were old an english style the book itself is about three human beings chasing after a giant narwhal as the author calls it these three characters are known as professor m arronax , a genius professor from france whose passion is to study , conseil , a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor , and ned land , a canadian harpooner conseil and the professor accept an invitation to the boat the abram lincoln , the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant cetacean , or a sea creature this creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds , and so the 3 meet up at the boat they pursue the creature for over a month , when they finally catch up with the lightning fast cetacean they pursue it , however when the creature strikes back ned land , conseil , and professor arronax are thrown into the ocean , and separated from their boat , they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean , to find out that it is not at all a sea monster , but an amazing submarine named the nautilus led by captain nemo they then learn of captain nemo 's plans , and embark on a submarine hunt on the bottom of the ocean , they discover atlantis , they venture to the south pole , and even fight among poulps or cuttlefish of enormous size , 20 , 000 leagues under the sea is full of adventure
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of literature and you should do n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one quarter of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher , and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel , pick up the elegant naval institute press edition , in a modern , complete , updated translation , with commentary by the leading american verne expert today , walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition \( no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint \) less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by jean michel margot , president najvs
of course it 's still not the same as reading the book
i'm only able to listen to audiobooks because not many are produced in braille , and those that are are so ridiculously high in price range so when i saw the talisman on audio on amazon , i knew i had to read it frank muller narrating the book was also another reason why i snapped it up
this is a plot to flip for \( read the book ! \) ! who else but the two masters of the dark side could team up to create such an incredibly scary , tearjerking , suspense filled dream of a book but king and straub ! one of my all time favorite reads !
i liked this book i like all of kings books , some better than others and some i will read over and over and over this one is the prequel to black house i like this one better but they are both good and i would read them together if you have n't read either of them
i'm not giving anything away here just wanted to say that this book was still enchanting the second time around i read it the first time when i was a teenager , and now in my 30s i have re read it and have fallen in love again well written , endearing , truly a classic
the book was everything i expected the story was great and the characters developed the whole way to the end action , suspence and a happy ending not all king books have a happy ending but i'm glad this one did
about a year ago i read black house and thoroughly enjoyed it i immediately knew i wanted to read the talisman , a book about the young jack sawyer and his early adventures in the territories however , there are always books i want to read and it took me until now to get to it i must say that i did not find this book to be all that compelling in the beginning , but around the time wolf made his appearance in the narrative i started getting hooked
the talisman chronicles the adventure of a twelve year old boy named jack sawyer the young hero sets out from the east coast of the usa in a bid to save his mother , who is dying from cancer jack needs to find the mystical artifact known only as the 'the talisman'
i 've read the talisman by stephen king peter straub no less than ten times , and i'm sure i 'll read it at least that many more times , if not more one of my favorite novels of all time , the talisman is the modern version of tom sawyer and the newer version of the lord of the rings bold statements , i know , but i ca n't say enough about this book king straub just clicked on this project and the results are brilliant
not my favorite but still interesting lots of description that can get your head pounding after a while though it 's def not a 2 3 day read
i liked this book a lot because it was a real adventure and it was very exciting i kept reading because i kept asking myself what would happen next it deffinately kept me interested until the end except when it got to the end i was quite disapointed the ending just left me hanging is there a sequel to this book \? i wish
i happened to read seize the night first i was still pulled in to this first book in the series the charcaters are very likable and the book left me wanting to know even more about them dean koontz is one of the best writers of our time
i love reading amazon reviews and it 's astonishing how especially in koontz' case reviews seem to vary between 5 and 1 star reviews all the time
linked to koontz 's work midnight , this is another interesting look at possibilities he artfully portrays the character of christopher snow and his rare disorder with a compassionate heart for that which is challenging koontz always uses an element or two of psychology in his works , and this one is no different koontz has done his research yet again so that he can accurately portray the physical and psychological effects of snow 's disorder also one of koontz 's more humorous novels , this was one of my favorites
good read over all that keeps you interested from start to finish if you can handle all the monkey business that seems a little goofy at times , it will be an enjoyable read
as a huge fan of the book watchers , the parallel in the two books was clear and overall this was a good book
this book is sooo extremely informative it explores issues relating to muslim women from many different islamic perspectives \( non muslims seem to be shocked that there is actually more than one islamic perspective ! ! ! \) roald , a convert to islam , critically examines specific issues from the eyes of the most important and relevant players in contemporary islamic discourse , from eastern and western muslim feminists , to the typical mainstream muslim writers \( in the west and in the arab world \) , to the wahhabi salafi literalists she is honest and insightful , and she includes personal experiences and anecdotes gathered from interviewees she also gives well cited hadeeth evidence and quranic verse to explain where many of her subjects' views originate she ties modern islamic rhetoric on women 's issues to the convergence of western cultural encounters with islam muslims due to colonialism and globalization , together with basic islamic sources of knowledge \( quran and hadeeth \) , and with culturalized islam in the arab context this book is a must read for people who want to take a critical and well informed look at the women in islam issue
this is a book that talks about advertising branding creativity it 's not about product design or r d creativity
have you ever wondered why some ad campaigns soar and others thud \? it 's definitely not the amount of money thrown at them in juicing the orange how to turn creativity into a powerful business advantage by pat fallon and fred senn , they argue that it comes down to creatively solving that one key business issue the client has
excellent real world examples of creative advertising marketing and the thought process involved a great read for newcomers to the advertising world
i loved this book fun entertaining while providing meaningful , salient and actionable suggestions in \( re \) focusing one 's activities and priorities in business development and management i'm a recovering business executive just starting my own entrepreneurial business and this work has been enormously helpful i ca n't recommend this enough get this book
there are a few interesting nuggest in the first few pages and then story , after story , after story there 's no doubt that their agency is successful but please present some principles and not story , after story , after story
i loved this book i found this fun and entertaining while providing specific , salient , concise and actionable ideas on managing a business while being driven by creativity i'm a recovering business executive just starting my own entrepreneurial enterprise and i found this work enormously helpful in helping me define and launch my business i ca n't recommend this book enough get this book
true or false is advertising obsolete \? fallon and senn say true unless it changes and they go about showing how it must change in recounting their best campaigns \( with some intellectual honesty in mentioning their losers \) the big ideas do n't steal a competitor 's emotion , find your own ads must bear an a to b connection in more revenue generation take risks to survive because incremental change will kill you the chapter on lee jeans is one of the best trust the focus groups when they have passion \( here , teenagers want to feel indestructible in their jeans \) do n't ape the competition \( the strong desire to be sexy like levi 's \) do n't be afraid to go to your roots \( here , bring back a doll icon from the compnay 's past \) and know , above all else , that emotions drive decisions the reason is tacked on later they also talk about how they run their shop fire prima dona employees or unreasonable clients understand what is worth fighting over undertstand that creativity is team driven believe in a few core idea and push them over and again
i found this book as enlightening and delightful as sitting and having a drink with a great leader in advertising personally , it has reinvigorated my own perspective as an agency account manager and i'm excited and motivated all over again about the accomplishments and contributions we can all make in marketing
with fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described after all , the reader is seated in a comfortable chair , one assumes , in pleasant surroundings but such is not the case with this novel the distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning , and like the wedding guest in coleridge 's poem , i was dragged from ohio to mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things i did n't want to see but could not avoid
i really am enjoying the audio recording of this book , but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word , to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous i understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece , but i think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it
i had to read this book for school i thought i would love it , but it turns out i was wrong this book was mind numbing it is drawn out and boring i almost threw the book away and rented the movie i should have this books sucks do n't waste your time reading it
a time to kill is definitely grisham 's best novel it 's interesting that it was grusham 's first novel , but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published the story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly racism , murder , justice , revenge , law and order , etc the story will hold you from start to finish most of grisham 's newer novels are simple , predictable stories that bash attorneys that is not the case with a time to kill it will grip you , tear you and entertain you all at the same time
a time to kill and the broker are my two favs from grisham suspense is the name of the game i like books that make me read them straight through because they 're so suspense filled another great novel is deadly behavior by dee sullivan
i have been interested in reading something by grisham for quite a while , but i was recently pushed to actually read one of his books when i saw the movie version of a time to kill the obvious book to start with was a time to kill i had heard that grisham is good , and i really enjoyed the movie , so i was expecting a lot i was not disappointed this book brings out some very interesting ideas about murder and the justification for it it also gave a very large amount of information about the legal system in general and trials in particular this legal iformation was probably my favorite part
i 've read many of grisham 's novels , and this remains my favourite it addresses complex issues and does not attempt to gloss them over i recommend this novel to those more familiar with grisham 's more recent work this is what he is capable of , and it is outstanding
this is my all time favorite book in one word powerful grisham does an excellent job at bringing the characters alive and making you care about them there is a lot of description to help you understand the south at a time when blacks were begining to be people , not things wonderful
john grisham has quite a reputation as being a very prolific author being the best selling author the 90 's means you 've got quite a reputation so i wanted to see what all the fuss was about and i picked up a time to kill needless to say it was a good book , but there are a few moments where it glares as it is grisham 's first book \( and believe me , in some areas it shows \) , i 'd expect a lack of substance surprisingly , there 's substance but there are times when the book really rambles on for a very long time
a tme to kill , the debut novel from acclaimed writer john grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a young black girl soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic , organic notions of the case , and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made true , the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50 100 pages without question , but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking , not answering , questions that need to be asked grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he would n't change a word with a story like that , you can see that he does n't need to , compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling in the end grisham nails it out of the park , and leaves his readers yearning for more
this book does a great job of covering several areas of debt that all consumers will find helpful it is written in an easy to understand language , yet rich with detail and a variety areas covered the chapter on debt collections touched on the topic of statute of limitations , which is very important to many consumers , including me i found that two other books that i read on consumer debt did not deal at all with this important topic i thank garrett sutton \( and contributor gerri detweiler \) for a very valuable book
i read this book to get a little more famaliar with budgets , and was very impressed with how many things this book touched on
the abc 's of getting out of debt trade your bad debt for good debt and your bad credit for good credit really stands out among the many credit and debt related books available to consumers for many reasons for starters , the book covers the topic of credit and debt in a very thorough and objective manner such critical , but often overlooked , topics as the health effects of debt are addressed in addition , the book provides very simple and practical steps to help consumers that are struggling with credit and or debt problems
i actually have the audio version of the book and found it to be both broad and in depth the author dispels many of the credit myths , and examines exactly how credit is established , rated , and how it can be used in both good and bad ways he spends a lot of time reviewing the subject of credit repair explaining how scammers \( especially on the internet \) operate he focuses on what you can do legally to improve your credit i 've read most books on credit and debt management and found this to be a welcome addition to my bookshelf

how awful was this book i had more questions than answers talk about speculations , and what ending i wrote the author because i was hoping he could help me clear up some questions i had he did respond i do n't discuss my books therefore , i will no longer buy and or read his books that is my own rage
this is an excellent book i am a huge jonathan kellerman fan
randolph \( rand \) duchay and troy turner , both age thirteen , kidnap and kill a two year old girl after trying to get her to puff on a cigarette and drink some beer big surprise she gagged , cried and fussed psychologist alex delaware was asked by the judge to evaluate each kid and submit his opinion to the judge as to whether they should be tried as juveniles or adults they 're tried and sent off to separate youth detention centers troy is dead six weeks later rand gets out at age 20 and is dead three days later however , hours before his death , he called delaware , asking to meet with him alex and his police friend , homicide detective milo sturgis , begin investigating rand 's murder the investigation leads them to all sorts of crazy people , relationships and situations
this was my first reading of a kellerman novel , though i 'd obviously heard about him for years i ca n't imagine a read much more painful than this novel he is the king of what writers call talking heads , just pages and pages of dialogue that go nowhere he also loves convenience , an absolute deal killer in mystery and suspense the characters delaware interviews protest for a few sentences then suddenly realize they better help him and then there are the pages and pages and pages where he and milo have to have impossibly mundane dialogue so the author can tell you how the mystery is unfolding because nothing in the material leads to any mystery of merit it 's also amazing that kellerman is a psychologist and his character is one as well , and yet so often it is other characters pointing out what even amateur phsychologists or observers of human beings would know if this is , as the jacket says , one of the world 's most popular authors , i need to go in search of the worst sellers
i like john rubenstein 's readings of kellerman 's many crime novels , which have continuity with old and new characters
on his release from prison , child murderer rand duchay contacted the only person who had ever showed him any compassion on the outside , psychologist alex delaware the two never met again , as duchay was killed before they can meet the murderer 's murder reopened a number of related cases , which on re examination are not as straightforward as the initially seemed
i just saw this exhibit at our moma , and the work is outstanding some of the images are color , some black and white there are a number of styles and artists , ranging from the very famous to those unknown outside of their small communities the point is that these are images of musicians it 's that simple
the catalog is gorgeous , the photographs are indeed spectacular while the written entries were wonderful , they were too few and left me wanting more i guess that 's a good thing
in response to another review on this site , clearly if you think the book has poor aesthetic quality you know nothing of photography or art for that matter
gee i 've never heard that poor aesthetic quality is an essential element of art i'm not even sure what poor aesthetic quality means but if it describes the heartbreaking , iconic portrait of johnny cash and june carter , then i surely want more of it these are beautiful , sometimes funny and often emotionally moving pictures in which the subjects collaborate with the artist to present a certain face to the world maybe not all the faces are completely honest ones , but they 're interesting and beautifully photographed
once you 've read the first page of this book you wo n't be able to put it down
and i'm glad that i did i read the killing floor many years ago and was not impressed it was n't bad , but child did not belong in the same league with many of the other author 's in the genre that i enjoyed 3 stars would be a generous rating for that first novel first being the operative word boy , has child 's writing improved full of terrific twists , one shot is a great page turner with a very well thought out plot i plan to read the whole series highly recommended
a man 's book love all of lee child 's stories
this is my second adventure with jack reacher and it has been the best so far so good that i succumbed and have ordered all of them
there is nothing essentially wrong with the plot and its suspense sniper gets caught for multiple murder the case seems watertight , then is n't , then gets solved by the hero from outside , the solution involving some inside dirt
i was looking for the new spenser book in my local bullseye themed maxi mart , since i was there anyway and had to kill time while my spouse tried on and retried swimsuits shockingly , they did n't have it , but they did have this little jewel by lee child
i enjoyed this book as i have all the other jack reacher stories i hope lee child does n't run out of steam too quickly
this is a real page turner you will read this and get adicted to jack reacher ! highly recommend for a great summer read
lee child 's jack reacher series continues to grow , remaining vibrant and surprising into book 8 , one shot reacher continues to walk the earth , seeking the solace of not having a plan that only frustrated career military man can know this time , reacher is in miami , enjoying the sights and the female company , when he hears a name of his past on the evening news , james barr seems james barr shot five innocents in indiana for no apparent reason five head shots , six bullets so reacher high tails it to indiana , intent on keeping a promise to make james barr suffer for this sin and a prior one and this will be a painful reunion for barr
from his early days at columbia , starting out with the liveright publishers in the 1920 's , and buying into the modern library classics , this is without doubt the best look at publishing i 've ever read ! the amusing story of how a special copy of ulysses came across the atlantic , and into the hands of us customs is worth the price of the book ! add to that , hilarious yarns , like meeting with gerturde stein her sidekick alice , featuring the hilarious promotion of their book so it could compete with the hot new book forever ambor , and its even hotter author k windor makes for some real fun mr cerf even wrote a short comment in some of ms stein 's books admitting he could not always figure out what they were about a trip to london to meet bernard shaw is also good for some laughs his comments on many other literati , including saroyan , faulkner , o' hara , ayn rand , wittaker chambers , etc plus general comments on the state of the world are all top in short , a must read for anyone of all ages , even if you do n't care too much about writing and publishing !
the beauty of this book is that you get to know bennett cerf as the scholarly , brillant , and excellent businessman who met the most amazing and well known writers of the 20th century the gentle questioner on what 's my line was the powerhouse of random house
when all of us who are now officially older than dirt were growing up back in the 1960 's , we usually aspired to be one of three particular men of achievement for those of us with an athletic bent , mickey mantle was the man of choice for those adventurers and dreamers among us , john glenn appeared to offer the perfect life finally , for us bookish sorts , bennett cerf , publisher of random house , panelist on what 's my line , author of some of the worst puns ever written , and all around man about town , was who we aspired to be this book is in essence his memoirs , told in oral history format just a short time before his unexpected death in 1971 he describes in detail why he was able to grow random house at such a rapid rate in his day , the book business was a stuffy one , and no publisher worth his salt would dream of lowering himself to seek out new authors bennett , being young , foolish , and very intelligent , would travel to wherever these authors lived and impress them with his obvious wit and sincerity the sheer number and weight of authors whose service he was able to acquire through these means was absolutely staggering eugene o'neill , james joyce , robinson jeffers , gertrude stein , and bill styron , to name a very few through his liberal editing policies , he was even able to publish authors whose ideas he completely disagreed with , such as ayn rand some , like playwright moss hart , became lifelong friends although new yorkers have long thought of their city as the center of the universe , bennett 's long and storied career made many believe it was true the reader will enjoy his chatty , breezy style time and again , as a reminder that at one time , in the world of books and publishing , one man truly made a difference
we do seem to love the story of a child whose life is so miserable that it begs for a magical rescue and an exciting , dangerous and hair raising adventure in james and the giant peach we meet one james henry trotter , one of these very same children who like his predecessors and successors \( harry potter , cinderella , those lemony snickett children , hansel gretel , ect \) is leading a desperate and miserable life with is two wicked aunts his parents were eaten by a wild , rampaging rhinoceros \( naturally \) on one particularly bad day , henry hides behind some bushes and meets a strange old man who gives him some magic crystals \( green glowing pellet things \) , which he is supposed to drink \( mixed with water and ten of his own hairs \) , but of course he promptly trips and spills them on the ground under an ancient and withered peach tree
james henry trotter lives a miserable life with his unpleasant relatives aunt spiker and aunt sponge when a mysterious old man gives james cooked crocodile tongues , strange things begin to happen a peach the size of a house grows on a withered tree in the aunt 's garden james crawls inside this peach and finds it full of friendly oversized bugs , each with an amusing personality james and his new bug friends journey from the aunt 's garden and eventually end up in new york city after many exciting adventures the goregous imagery , endearing songs and unique characters found in this tale have delighted a wide range of readers this book is a joy to read and shall work it 's magic on who all read it
this is the best book ever written period seriously this book changed my life on many levels james is the perfect little boy ever i wish he were my son no scratch that i wish he was my husband no but really this book made peaches my favorite food ever everyone should read it it should be mandatory reading for citizenship into america , to obtain a highschool diploma , and to go to the bathroom okay go read then eat a peach james and the giant peach is the besst book ever , it gave me morals it solidified my views on the intersection of race , slavery , freedom , and talking centipedes this book taught me right from wrong this guy in the computer lab with me does not like this book i question his intelligence he threw a frisbee paper plate at me , if he had read james and the giant peach he would know violence is not the anwser that is all go rea
\( my first grade students have created a review to share with other readers this what they wrote \)
james and the giant peach is a great book ! i love the pictures james is a young boy with nagging dumb parents james had a peach tree in his garden and in a few days the peach was huge james found a hole in the peach and went inside it james just saw yellow flesh then he cut a piece of and clibed inside the peach when the creatures inside saw him they were in a panic james was greeted by the silk worm and the glow worm the other creatures made a drink because james was thirsty james started to get used to them i recomend this book for children who like rhoal dahl
i think that whenever i re read james and the giant peach by roald dahl , i am transfixed by the fact that it was merely a child 's story written by the author who brought us charlie and the chocolate factory and matilda and so many other wonderful classics why do i love it \? i am an adult with children of my own should n't they be reading it instead of dear old dad \? well yes no roald dahl wrote many things in his lifetime and though he is remembered best for his children 's fiction , he wrote a number of macabre tales and other adult oriented stuff he never talked down in his books to kids and that is probably why i love james so much it was first read to me by a teacher in the fifth grade i can recall , each day at reading time , being entralled by the book , taking delight in every outlandish twist and turn as an adult , i gotta say , i still get a pretty big kick out of it so come along , join me and james henry trotter watch out for aunt sponge and aunt spiker is that a grasshopper , and a spider , and a centipede , and an earthworm
go through the alphabet with edward gorey one death at a time ! this is a great gift for anyone you might know with a dark sense of humor or as a gift to a young child whose parents you do n't particularly like this short story is , like all of gorey , a wonderfully illustrated and twisted look at the world from a very different perspective if you already like , or have an interest in edward gorey , i would recommend you skip this and just purchase amphigorey which contains this story as well as many others
i was very pleased with the product that i ordered as well as the time it took to receive it hardly any time at all
one of the most imaginative books i 've ever read i put it out when friends come over so we can laugh and talk about the images i 'll definitely be getting gorey 's other books
what can you say about the quintessential edward gorey book that has n't already been said \?
i wish i could give this zero stars it is a very dark book and i ca n't imagine why anyone would write , publish , gift it , or read it there is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk \? garbage in garbage out !
yes , it 's sick yes , it 's twisted but it defines gallows humor no , you 're not an evil person for laughing at these rhymes and accompanying pictures frankly , you 're probably better adjusted than the people who freak out over them \( it 's just a book , you lunatics ! \)
edward gorey 's stories of the 1960s , pen and ink illustrations with seemingly innocuous one liners full of droll humour under the surface , set in some vague victorian or edwardian times , have long been among my most entertaining reading with the grashlycrumb tinies , however , gorey turned to a very macabre sort of humour with a send up of children 's alphabet books
this is n't exactly babys first a b c book , but it makes a great gift for the goth in your family
yes , it 's warped ! i feel like such an utter sociopathic evil human being for thinking this sick creation is completely hysterical oh , gosh , i mean , what 's wrong with me that i break out laughing over what sounds in description the most demented thing ever drawn \?
an awesome history lesson , especially for those who have forgotten what it takes to defeat evil in the world i hesitantly started reading this book expecting some blowhard general to gloat about his limited accomplishments in the big war i had a very pleasant surprise and was drawn into another perspective of what we did as a nation to defeat hitler and his cronies the title is taken from a line in the cadet 's prayer from west point it is a prayer we all could use to recite occasionally i very highly recommend this book
i really enjoyed this first hand account of general bennett 's experiences i have read this type of book extensively , and i put this very close to the top of my list
the first hand telling of wwii by a retired 4 star general detailed battle discriptions and analysis , and amazing individual encounters possibly the best book i have ever read ! ! ! !
i have read many books on wwii from many perspectives and have been to visit the d day beaches four times i cannot visit the american graves in normandy without being moved twice i have had the experience of hearing taps played near omaha beach i have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died i had high expectations for the book my problem is that the book never finds its voice at times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men i wanted to hear more from this man just as he starts to share , the general leaps in and throws off the narrative let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different \( a few photos and maps would be nice \) if the general needs to talk , give him a separate chapter at the end of the book we hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels their voices could add to the history i wish the colonel would have spoken for them
simple concept , easy read , expensive book and worth 10 times the cost this is n't just someone 's personal philosophy but a concept backed by irrefutable scientific studies the most profound statement in the book is the proven fact that almost every interaction with others rarely has a nuetral effect it almost always leaves the other person feeling more positve or negative that awareness has me looking for opportunities to apply this at home , at work or with the clerk i buy groceries from my life is twice as enjoyable as before because i am continually touching lives and spreading the joy
i was thinking negative thoughts waiting for the book to advise me on positive thoughts
i have long been a proponent of encouragement as a means to build healthy , strong relationships and promote growth this book offers a concrete plan for making that happen i have observed people moved to tears by a little appreciation people are starving for love and appreciation do n't let the people in your life suffer any longer
i ordered this book on friday august 25th at 4 53 p m
written in the first person , this book is a quick read that is both logical and simple the bucke dipper concept is easy to apply every day and sure to improve your management style as well as your personal life relevant research supports the asserted power of positive psychology my favorite gallup author hits a homerun !
life is a simple game is n't it \? from the beginning of time it has been a battle of good vs evil we get to choose the side we play on by being a positive person or a negitive person this book will lift your spirits and fill your bucket ! if you want to get fired up today read this book , and if you want to get a friend fired up and fill their bucket suggest they buy it too , or better yet buy a copy and give it to them thanks for an inspiring read david otis author of walk fast , talk loud and smile
this is a great book to help any manager understand the importance of recognition both to their peers and to the people they manage the philosophy of adding to or taking away from one 's bucket and hence their esteem adds a whole new importance to thinking about how you act in situations with so many people leaving jobs because of how they are treated , the book brings an honest reality to exactly how this happens , and gives great insight into why we need to be sure our actions are constantly giving value to other people i gave it out to a group of leaders as part of a recognition training , and two of them said not only did they rethink their actions in their departments , they also began to rethink their actions at home , and it made a difference in personal relationships plus , there 's an online way to give drops , which makes it even easier to let someone know you saw or noticed they did something great , and they have a tangible piece of recognition to have and display a terrific book all the way around

anyone who is well versed in running a business will know what his or her costs are and where those costs can be reduced if need be this is a wonderful book that lists 181 ways to reduce operating costs people who are planning to start a business might not know where wasteful costs can be cut , and they will greatly benefit from reading this book
young obviously was teasing us with the ygbk acronym daring us to read on and figure it out later in the book , in one of his ygbk descriptions , he ends it with the statement you gotta be kidding
the book is eduactional in the sense that the ideas mentioned are all valid points and easily comprehensible the one fault this book has starts in the first chapter when it states make sure you avoid these ygbk 's my question to you is what is that i have thoroughly looked for the meaning of this acronym and have come up empty if anyone could provide some light please do
i did not even finish this ! ! i have no idea what this book was trying to get across i give bono credit for the hard work he is doing for aids but i do not understand where or what this conversation \? \? \? was all about sorry bono , i am a big fan of your music , but this book was so confusing and not at all enlightening
you will probably love this book if you are interested in god , love , and or rock and roll bono displays a profound understanding of scripture , love for god and his wife , and a wicked sense of humour highly recommended
really a great book , with very little glitz added to his image the conversations ring very true , and very funny
loved it enough at the movies to buy it what a great fun film also prompted me to buy firefly the series which i am having great fun with , too
to anyone who has wondered why bono is the way he is , this book pretty much answers any questions you may have had he comes across as a very bright and caring person who has a sarcastic wit about him , but who can change gears and get into some fairly deep topics you also get to hear why charity is so important to him the talks on charity were my favorite chapters all in all recommended for u2 and bono fans
whatever you think of the man , bono is something else here we get some genuine insight into what makes this extraordinary individual tick the series of dialogues between the irish singer and old friend french writer michka assayas covers just about everything you can think of with intelligence and humour at one point they discuss that these conversations themselves may be some kind of therapy for bono since the relatively recent death of his father
i have to admit that i'm a huge u2 fan , and a huge bono fan so my thoughts on this book may be a bit biased but on that note , i figure that i like so many other u2 fans who 've read this book have a greater ability to give criticism i 've read numerous u2 books on varying subjects , so i guess i was expecting nothing more than a carbon copy , for the most part , of those books this was not a carbon copy ! i echo other reviewers who said they loved the conversational style of the book it makes me wish more people would do something like this rather than just beefed up , ghost written memoirs that hardly reveal anything but assayas does a great job at keeping bono \( one who has a tendency to deviate and ramble \) on subject bono himself explains how he 's a very forward looking person and does n't like to revisit the past assayas spends a good portion of the book having bono look back
one of the best u2 books i 've ever read , mostly because it allows for a first person perspective from bono michka generally divides each conversation into a single chapter \( although this is not true for the first 4 chapters \) , so the chapters go by easily , and the titles are quite funny overall bono meanders his way through subjects like death , spirituality , africa , what it means to be a rock star , and love i already loved bono immensely before reading this book , and now i think i have arrived at a new level of admiration and respect for the man so many sections of this book are quotable bono has great opinions on all sorts of things , yet he 's funny , self deprecating , and extremely intelligent michka , to be honest , annoyed me after awhile some of his questions were either too broad , or just too simple for somebody who 's considered bono as a friend since 1980 , i felt like i knew more about bono 's life in some areas than michka did , and i 've only been a u2 fan for about four years still , the book is excellent , especially when bono wanders off into reflections on his personal relationship with god , for example definitely a must read for any u2 fan
as the singer has said many times before he sings into the ear of his fans but its nice to know a little bit more of his life , and more clearly in a conversation
excellent job done by mr utterback
this book covers much of the same ground that clayton christensen explored in his three revolutionary books the innovator 's dilemma , the innovator 's solution , and seeing what 's next truthfully , those books do a far superior job of explaining the dynamics of innovation in comparison to the performance of this book utterback does have very insightful comments on the standardization of product design , but outside of that section , the book is not particularly exemplary for those interested in mastering the art of innovation , the game begins and ends with clayton christensen
this book is written in a concise manner that is straightforward and easy to understand utterback explains how innovation has evolved over the years , using great examples from a variety of assembled and non assembled industries one side note , i found that this book was worth the cover price for the history of industries he mentions alone some of the products and industries mentioned in this book include incandescent light bulbs , typewriters , glass , photography , and ice this book is loaded with invaluable nuggets of insight , it is impossible to due it justice in a book review i highly recommend reading it
utterback explains how companies can seize opportunities in the face of technological change there are dozens \( hundreds \? \) of other books on the same subject , notably those written by geoffrey a moore i rate this book so highly because it is exceptionally well organized and well written , because it examines several offbeat subjects \( eg the development of the typewriter and the evolution of the typewriter industry , the development of the incandescent electric light \) , and because utterback focuses so intensely and so effectively on real world situations in which the dynamics of innovation are manifest this book is very informative but also great fun to read \( those who enjoy it as much as i did are urged to read both the history of invention and the lever of riches \) chapter 4 revisits the the dynamics of the innovation model \( figure 1 1 \) and then in chapter 5 , utterback shifts his attention to developments within the plate glass manufacturing industry in chapter 6 , he examines the innovation differences between assembled and nonassembled products subsequent chapters sustain the discussion of the power of innovation in the creation of an industry and then , in chapter 9 , utterback draws together some of the lessons of earlier chapters and academic research to consider the relationship between the behaviors and strategies of firms with respect to technological innovation and long term survival he concludes his book \( in chapter 10 \) by addressing the perennial management issue of how corporations can renew their technology , products , and processes as a basis for continued competitive vitality it is obvious to all of us that even the strongest product and business strategy will eventually be overturned by technological change ours is an age in which change is the only constant therefore , as utterbach explains so carefully and so eloquently , the challenge is to accept the inevitability of change which results from technological innovation \( discontinuities \) and to sustain a commitment to cope effectively with such change only such a commitment will win the day
the existing reviews really get to the heart of the matter i can only add that this book continues to provide a powerful framework for analyzing technical innovation the process and maturation of that innovation within a market as i survey the rapid growth of trading hubs net market makers in the industrial procurement space , i am struck by the similarity to the examples in the book the hyper growth in this space sets the stage for the inevitable shakeout and establishment of the dominant model yet to be determined it is exciting to watch the market mature , with the knowledge that the changes are part of a cycle which can be comprehended and has repeated itself in multiple industries utterback provides a powerful framework with which technological innovation can be understood thank you
this is a fascinating and chilling account of technological innovation it belongs on the recommended list of technology managers and staff alike utterback marshals compelling case histories that provide the objective foundations for more popular accounts of technology formation such as geoffrey moore 's crossing the chasm \( 1 \) we gain insight into why it 's so crowded at the bottom reasons exist in abundance why firms that epresent established technology are the least likely to perceive the threat represented by radical innovation it is a slight exaggeration to say utterback makes current management sound like the last czar of russia praising the happiness of the serfs yes , perhaps the serfs were happy but the bolsheviks were n't in short , the technological discontinuity is not going to come from established competitors all the electric typewriter manufacturer 's were taken down by the word processor but how then to recognize the radical innovation \? the key to utterback 's argument is the idea of a dominant design of a technology it forms the center of a network of system features , user habits , collateral assets such as brand image , market channel and customer switching costs by definition , the dominant design wins the market it is the pattern to which both competitors and incremental innovators must adhere to if they aim at significant following in the current market it is what radical innovation over throws many case histories are provided each of the chapters illuminates an aspect of the dynamics of innovation by drilling down into a specific example thomas edison came late to the race to produce a commercial electric lamp he succeeded through ingenuity and systematic thinking from the start , he planned for scalability , aiming to deliver electricity through the very illuminating gas conduits that formed his major competitors' delivery system he also laid down a network of patents as he worked and legally pursued those who tried to steal his mechanisms utterback 's other examples include the qwerty typewriter key board \( an example as powerful as it is elegant and simple \) , the bm compatible pc , the cray computer , the intel based massively parallel computer , the ball point pen , the float process of making plate glass , celluloid \( kodak \) film , the incandescent light bulb , the intel x86 chip , and a dozen other engaging from the history of economics a fascinating account of cutting natural ice from the lakes of new england in the mid 1800s should have a sobering i almost wrote chilling effect on the complacent technology manager here radical innovation means one thing refrigeration paradoxically , the ice industry , which efficiently transported harvested ice as far away as india , was unable to envision refrigeration industry outsiders were the ones why \? according to utterback , industry insiders have a heavy investment , both technological and emotional , in the existing system of infrastructure , distribution , and production from a practical point of view , their managerial attention is encumbered by the system they have just maintaining and marginally improving their existing systems is a full time occupation they are ripe for the process which the economist schumpeter described \( 2 \) as creative destruction \( utterback 's book exemplifies how schumpeter is reborn as the intellectual god father among the silicon valley ideas as economic drivers mind set \) thus , innovation shows up as a game of chutes and ladders a new technology represents a ladder to get off the slope of incremental progress and jump to another level the chute is the path by which managers dedicated to the customers of the about to be obsolete technology follow it into oblivion and obscurity this is a grim prospect , and , according to utterback 's cases , one that occurs about 70 of the time in the case of david and goliath , history is on the side of the sling shot how do the lucky few reinvent themselves \? this possibility is appreciated by utterback , who provides the examples of hp and motorola but the examples of what does n't work are legion discounted cash flow will rarely \( never \) fund risky , radically innovative projects compromises like dec 's simultaneous pursuit of vax and mips chips , with one foot on each side of the chasm , helps to explain how dec ended up its bottom assigning the new technology initiative to the establishment department is like asking the philistine goliath to be little david 's mentor if a state of the art lab is established , then you may end up with xerox parc , which invented modern computing without benefiting xerox of course , you may end up with edison 's menlo park work shop or bell labs so this approach though risky is a gamble with pay off prospects a diversified portfolio of r amp d projects is part of the equation but equally important are top management 's commitment , patience , and persistence the enterprise wide nurturing of core competencies in marketing and distribution , as well as product design and implementation , are on the critical path to firm wide renewal finally , reading utterback 's text itself would be useful step for technology managers in understanding how to cross , instead of ending up at the bottom of , the chasm of technological discontinuity and innovation \( 1 \) moore , geoffrey crossing the chasm new york harper collins , 1995 \( 2 \) schumpeter , joseph business cycles new york mcgraw hill , 1939 excerpt from my review in computing reviews , november 199
more than a million copies of this reference classic 's prior editions have been sold , so if this updated 20th edition the complete dog handbook holds a familiar ring , that 's why but the 20th edition offers even more not only is it endorsed by the powers and professionalism of the american kennel club , but it packs in all 153 breeds recognized by the club , along with standards , breed histories , and photos including the twelve most recently recognized breeds lest you think this is just for pros , look at the sections advising on how to choose and train a dog , responsible breeding , canine first aid and more add sections on akc sports and a glossary of terms and you have a real winner
book was a textbook for a niece going to dog grooming school was in good condition and just what she needed she was pleased
i am a dog lover this book is truly complete in many important ways my library has this book available both in circulation and in the reference department this unusual situation speaks well for this book
i recommend this book to every novice who wants to learn about types of dogs able to compete in conformation shows as it gives the akc official standard of each breed however , this book needs to be updated very soon there are at least 9 new breeds that have been added to the amercian kennel club since this publication
this book is a good reference for breeders and enthusiasts it has the breed standards for all the akc recognized breeds as of the publication date it also goes into basic dog care i would definitely recommend it to families still struggling with what breed to pick out check out the book , talk with your veterinarian then go to a dog show and talk with breeders and trainers
excellent book you can find most of this information on their web site , but it 's great to take to a dog show when you have questions about other breeds wonderful book i always reference it
my husband is a dog show judge and has been looking for this book as always , amazon has what i need this book is 2 yrs out of date , but this is n't amazons' fault overall , the dog standards have not changed , except akc has added some new breeds that are n't listed will be valuable with our breed \( miniature dachshunds \)
the author should be sued for deception the biggest blunder i 've ever made was buying this book
one thing you should realize about this book is that it is not a detailed investment book if you are looking for such a book you should pick up something by bill bernstein or jack bogle the vast majority of this book deals with behavioral finance \( and the stupid mistakes people can make as a result \) and colorful stories of huge investment blunders that modern professionals have made i think it is critical to understand the mistakes that people can make because of their mood , fears , unbridled optimism , etc this book tries to adddress much of that the chapters dealing with huge plunders that professionals have made are entertaining and informative
john feinstein broke out in the sports book business with the million seller 1987 book season on the brink and he has n't looked back since like clockwork , feinstein writes one book a year on some facet or another of sports , although clearly his love goes to college basketball and golf
make no mistake this is not john feinstein 's best work other reviewers have correctly pointed out it is repetitive , a bit too long , and he has a tendency to name drop to the point of kissing arse

because i have ! in his book on acc basketball in some cases , he did n't change a word just repeated the same anecdotes i am really glad that i did n't pay for this book because i would have been really angry about re reading old material
there is that silly cult movie about wrestling called vision quest where elmo \( j c quinn \) talks to louden \( mathew modine \) who is not going to wrestle the meanest \( you know what \) wrestler in the valley , and j c quinn talks about pele , scoring an impossible goal , on his back , turned the other way , and he tells louden that for one moment that effort raised the human spirit allright granted , kind of silly and louden eventually beats shute which is a turnabout as if george custer won but do n't forget the picture had a very hot linda fiorentino which made up for a few gaps in the believability quotient
as a big march madness fan , i couldnt help but check this book out from my local library i love college basketball and especially the big dance this book is a great look behind the scenes at the final four and is full of valuable insight and interesting side stories
i 've only read the first 70 pages or so , but agree with others that this is repetitious you better love the acc , because it 's mostly about those teams and ucla
a great read ! while its main theme is the 2005 final four , coach roy williams and the tar heels of north carolina , it provides a wealth of historical information on how march madness developed over several decades it also provides the reader with an insight into the politics of the ncaa tournament as well as how the tv revenues influence many of the decisions made by the selection committee
the last dance joins other excellent books by john feinstein he especially has a feel for college basketball anyone who loves the chase for the national championship will love this book
hernando de soto 's the other path is a much drier read than its follow up the mystery of capital i'm glad i read tmc first it gave a global economic perspective that i could relate to and which interested me in reading more of the author 's work the other path is very detailed in its portrayal of peruvian politics , the intricacies of laws governing property rights and transactions , and the evolution of businesses from extralegal to legal operations while this very book was the tool used by the peruvian government to successfully solve its terrorism problem in the 1980s , by legalizing the economic operations of the majority of its marginalized citizens , and while its message and methods are even more relevant in the current climate of global terrorism , the step by step detail makes it a tedious read and i could n't get all the way through i will , at some point , try again , but i'm glad i read the mystery of capital first
i love the little jibe provided within the title of hernando de soto 's the other path it 's a poke at the shining path \( sendero luminoso \) , the maoist peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de soto 's homeland beginning in 1980 de soto 's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient to those who know de soto 's work , the solutions are well known build a system of laws that allow one 's residents to buy , sell and value property rights and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business
i enjoyed this book but was spoiled because i first read the mystery of capital and then this this book 's stats are somewhat outdated because so much has happened in the last 15 20 years , which takes away from the crispness of the argument , but the argument is still apparent and sound although i agree that eliminating government red tape to let more people become a part of the economic system and therefore become plugged into the benefits of the system \( eg , a legal work address for customers to reach you at , legal recognition so to advertise , etc \) and thereby allow government to collect more taxes so to \( hopefully \) put more money toward fighting social problems i hope de soto agrees that the economic answer to terroism is not the only answer stregthening the economic infrastructure is a strong part of the answer , but much more is also needed for some people to not desire to kill other people , and that may be something which can never be had although i would say the mystery of capital is a must read , this is nonetheless a great supplement to the mystery of capital
de soto does a great job of outlining some of the consequences of excessive regulation and lack of a strong rule of law in three distict industries \( transportation , housing and commerce \) de soto shows how productivity and wealth generation are hampered by poor laws and law enforcement this book is essential for anyone interested in the microeconomics of development
desoto is a genuinely original thinker this was his first book that argued that regulation in developing countries impedes economic development his most memorable example is one of a small entrepreneur who wants to open a hot dog stand in peru with six months of working with government entities they could get a permit no wonder why some people choose to work in the grey economy desoto looks at a number of areas where regulation slows down the natural tendency of individuals to be entrepreneurial the mystery of capital which is his second book has new data and amplification of his original premise but this one , which has been translated into many languages and should be used as a guide
personally , the book 's main contribution was that it shed many lights on the 'consequences' of delaying \( or not granting \) formal documents , papers , etc to property this is a critical issue esp to goverment officers in developing countries who do not realise \( unintentionally or otherwise \) that simply delaying the processing of e g business licenses , land applications , etc will affect the development of their own populace and country de soto 's work is definately worth reading and preaching to officials and land administrators everywhere
de soto 's work was viewed by economists , historians , and politicians alike as breakthrough he gives us an in depth look at the lima 's informal sector and postulates , much to the satisfaction of his washington , d c bankroll , that peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market capitalism unfortunately , he has twisted peru 's real scenario to reflect what washington wants to hear in reality , lima 's informal sector is merely a way for a depraved population to survive , not a radical shift toward capitalism de soto 's institue for liberty and democracy was funded almost in full by washington , and the man himself has spent more time in the u s than in peru this book leans more toward american propaganda than objective analysis an interesting read , but only with abundant grains of salt
i will concede mr wolters critics that this book does emphasize firm discipline however i do not see this as a bad thing after all anyone who owns a dog , irregardless if they hunt , take it in public , or just keep it around the house wants a disciplined dog that they can control it does not teach excessive cruel punishment , just enough to let the dog know they were in the wrong it actually emphasizes lack of attention and apathy more for initial and minor corrections this book does counter the stern discipline by emphasizing the need to give affection after the rebuke when it is said that the book uses old ways and techniques , remember that this book was originally written in 1961 but by no means is it outdated as far as training it provides a solid foundation of techniques and important commands what this book does not specify is timeframes on when to teach what this is because every dog is different it approaches the timeframe issue by applying the idea that when one thing is learned , move on to the next , but continue to reinforce all the previous trainings the important thing to consider when looking at this as well as any other book is that time is the critical factor continuous daily training from an early age provides a system with which to grow this book establishes that framework with this system , you can train your dog to do anything
i used this method 11 years ago to train my golden to hunt he has performed wonderfully and has hunted with me and loved going afield all these years arthritis has limited his ability , but he still loves to go i am picking up a llewellin pup in a few weeks and plan on using wolter 's methods once again i highly recommend this to any novice hunting dog owner
this was a waste of money , i bought wolters gun dog afterwards and it made this video look even worse
i think i am quite literate about the topic dog training and i really loved this book and the video there is nothing in it that will harm your dog as some reviews tell you to punishing , nothing i used his wolters methods to teach my german shepard now i teacj my enlish pointer he is 5 months old and i took him to his first hunting he was well prepared it even was more an education for me to trust him more
this is a wonderful book wolters has helped me to train one of the best dogs i have ever hunted with which surprised me since this is the first dog i have ever trained people compliment me whenever they see my dog in action whether it be at the lake , park or in the feild highly recomended
fukuyama outlines how the intermediate social organizations of society , under the protestant ethic , permitted the development of modern capitalist structures whereas in low trust societies \( where you cannot depend on the corresponding person to trust you , or you to trust him \) , only family oriented businesses could grow , and inevitably collapsed after the second or third generation he links the development of these intermediate organizations guilds , ptas , unions , volunteer activities to the social fabric that engendered trust he comments that a country can spend this hard to develop social capital and eventually become a rigid , non trusting , and economically backward state furthermore , fukuyama points out that the united states probably is doing just that , in nearly all intermediate social organizations , which are now surrounded by litigious critics the educational system , boy scouts , union management conflicts , the catholic church \( which has never trusted its parishioners to have other than the standard orthodoxy , and now has suffered enormous scandal \) , and so forth the lack of trust in our country is seen as pointing to our economic future , whether for good or bad
this book was written \( i bet \) by unpaid graduate assistants i borrowed it from the library to read before mr fukuyama 's arrival to speak at a university
fukuyama trots out stereotypes that he must have picked up at his japanese protestant father 's knee , under a thick veneer of impenetrable sociological jargon that can fool the occasional reader into believing that this is an impartial scientist at work like all stereotypes , fukuyama 's are a blend of breathtaking overgeneralizations , and huge blind spots and , like all stereotypes , they are utter nonsense
i live in europe close to the fault line between \( in fukuyama speak \) low trust land and high trust land and i have rarely read such an interesting book in some ways the book is the successor to max weber 's magnum opus , the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism \( published in 1905 \) about the impact of protestant religion and culture on economical success in germany
what makes francis fukuyama such a special author is his ability to 1 \) take large , complicated subjects such as the dynamics of industrial economies or the breakdown of the american family and substitute them with larger and more substantive themes he brings social science back to its grand roots , broadening the circle of human understanding 2 \) fukuyama has a unique gift to push the public dialogue into new and unchartered territory he challenges people to think differently he accomplishes this again in trust it is an impressive book which re connects the issues of culture and economics his thesis that public values , especially trust , shapes the direction of national economies is well proved by the author i will add , though , that the book got a bit long winded at times it seemed to lack focus periodically , especially in the heart of the book i would have also preferred that mr fukuyama spend more time examining the united states i do not see why it should receive the same attention as the other countries , ranging from japan to italy i would also have been interested to hear more about his feelings about how communism will impact russia 's culture and economic future but these mild criticisms do not greatly impact was is an important and interesting work
by the age of 24 , russian aristocrat dmitri andreich olenin has squandered half his fortune , failed to complete his university courses , and has n't selected a career lacking nothing and bound by nothing , he volunteers as a cadet for service in the caucasus here he hopes to find adventure , and by strict economy , perhaps even pay his debts on his last night in moscow , the aristocratic olenin muses about love and the meaning of life while his friends secretly question olenin 's judgment in volunteering for military service , olenin sees his posting to the caucasus as an escape , and even possibly a second chance at life
in the middle of the cossacks , dmitri olenin , a young russian cadet reflects joyfully , happiness is to live for others how clear it is ! , while being mercilessly bitten by mosquitos during a deer hunt despite the fact that his whole body is consumed by a consuming itch , olenin revels in the beauties of bountiful nature it is almost as if he gives himself up to the mosquitos , whom he imagines are yelling out to each other , over here , boys ! here 's someone we can devour ! tolstoy develops the scene with such skill we see olenin 's joy quickly turn into confusion and mortal terror
here 's a book that not many people know about which should be read by all it was really just what i needed to read , having just dropped out of university myself also , does anyone else think that this book must have greatly influenced hemingway \? it sounds just like him , and he says in a moveable feast that he was reading lots of russian stuff at the start of his career i realize it might just be that the translator liked hemingway , but even so it 's amazing how much it ends up reading like one of his novels and is so unlike the rest of tolstoy
truly the best novella that i have ever read the story of a young russian aristocrat disillusionned with the life of a city gentleman who looks to the simpler life of a soldier in the caucasus for his completion an outstanding read
my grandshildren love this book ! one was concerned that some of the letters folded , and did not look like themselves , but he 's gaining perspective on this
i read this to my preschoolers almost everyday they call it the coconut book they 're learning the alphabet , identifying letters , and building their vocabulary
i first read this to my son when he was one and a half months old he smiled and \( almost \) laughed , he liked it so much amazing that a book can do that to a child at that age he still loves it , and you 'll be amazed how quickly you learn to recite it by memory it comes in handy all the time waiting in the doctor 's office , riding in the car , anytime he starts to fuss and it does n't matter if i do n't even have the book around i just say it and the words capture his attention excellent
thank you for the book it arrived very fast and i ca n't wait to use it in my class
i taught preschool for years and now have a 6 month old i have read chicka chicka so many times that i can quote it verbatim from the first a to the last boom the thing about this book is how easy it is to make it exciting and fun for the listener anyone who teaches knows that reading to kids is almost as much about the acting as it is about the words and the pictures this book lends itself so easily to sign language , volume changes \( boom boom ! \) , tempo changes , humor , and body movements if you 're not willing to twist yourself ally oop like o , you may not grasp its greatness if you are , your listeners will be hooked on chicka
a creative twist on learning the alphabet my children all really enjoy this book it has bright , vivid colors we used this book a lot during our teacher education classes as well it is seen as a classic and enjoyed by children
i remember thoroughly enjoying this book when i was in kindergarten that was 16 years ago it 's a great book
i started reading this to my now 19 month old twin daughters when they were 9 months old at first they just loved looking at the colorful letters , then it moved on to giggling at the chicka chicka boom boom ! verse now , they actually flip through the pages and try to read the story themselves they will actually babble the rhythm , with a word sprinkled here and there
our 2 year old daughter got the new blues clues tape for the abc and they read chicka chicka boom boom on it she just loved it so we bought both the chicka chicak boom boom and the 123 numbers books she loves these books ! they sell a set with magnetic numbers and i regret not buying that one , but we have other letters to use for additional book interaction plus blues clues does n't do the entire story , so it was fun to be able to read the rest of the book after the letters fall out of the tree i highly recommend this book for any child learning their abc it 's fun for learning
kofi annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that kofi annan the peacekeeper is ironic in that annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the un , support for arafar , etc
kurt vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels two of them are truly great cat 's cradle is one \( slaughterhouse five is the other \)
kurt vonnegut knows how to draw your attention , and it 's often only after you 've finished the book that you realize the level of seriousness that he was trying to portray
cat 's cradle is basically a unique and creative look at the end of the world to me , vonnegut is arguing that the dizzying progress of science and technology in the last century has made the total destruction of life on earth a frightening possibility , and it 's not just the bad guys that threaten humanity with annihilation an equal threat comes from the well intentioned but short sighted , from the lonely or downtrodden , from the greatest superpower to the tiniest and poorest island nation
did n't know what to expect thought it might be difficult reading for some reason turns out it was pretty easy i guess it just gives you a lot to think about instead of looking up words and things like that i think it could have been a 4 5 5 star book if the story would have been expanded upon to at least 500pp , or at least long enough to develop the characters
kurt vonnegut 's cat 's cradle is the story of a man , jonah , who is writing about the end of the world , or the day when the atom bomb was dropped his work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position the story features an imaginative religion , a scientific potion , and a far off society as part of vonnegut 's many bizarre episodes jonah , researches the father of the atom bomb and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped seemingly against his will , jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true his journeys ultimately land him , along with the children , on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own
okay , i would like to give it 5 stars ! what was i thinking , i ca n't change it now \? ! \? ! a truly entertaining , and somewhat frightening book i do n't like to write long reviews , so i 'll get right to it if you enjoyed slaughterhouse five , you 'll most certainly enjoy this novel cat 's cradle is more accessible , and not as outrageous as slaughterhouse \( which i enjoyed a little more \) what can be said about vonnegut that has n't already been said he was ahead of his time in thumbing his nose at the powers that be do yourself a favor and read this book now
i frankly hold this one book as the perfect example of fiction writing at its best intelligent , creative , wry , funny , brilliant read it ! if you do n't have at least a slightly twisted sense of humor , do n't bother reading it
i 've read many of vonnegut 's books over the past few years and i have to say that this is easily his greatest work it contains a gripping tale about a protagonist that is stuck in a world that is almost certainly doomed to fail along the way there are many interesting thoughts expressed and funny moments
i do n't know whether to categorize the book as political , adventurous , anti religious , satirical or philosophical \( perhaps all \) this being my first vonnegut novel , i can say with personal conviction , that i am a staunch bokononist the journey of cat 's cradle is one of absurdities , cliches , wisdom , luck and chance what i find intriguing is how vonnegut manages to balance the seriousness of the atomic bombing of japan , and the foolish life of a scientist , who helped create it i do like the characters and feel they all have their moment of catharsis somehow they all feel relevant to the story , yet john \( the main character \) never seems dull
this is truly an amazing book , if your interested in reading anything by kurt vonnegut i would recomend this being your first , i swear it , if you read cats cradle you will be hooked on vonegut
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer , imho it has romance , treasure hunting , and a little magic really great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down i read it several years ago
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters , and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep sea diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed , maybe because i did not want it to end ! also , i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state , the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree , the blue green water , the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read , however i am an avid jd robb reader
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her , it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet , romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book , whether you like romance novels or not
first , let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books , more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read , her stories tend to be very formulaic , and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's , for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before , my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books , this one went against convention in many ways , while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship , but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain , but the love story was touching as other readers have said , i liked how she spread it out over the years , which made it slightly more realistic , and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short , if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan , give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered , but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men , and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream
plain truth , set in lancaster county , pennsylvania , would be better entitled , fancy lies an eighteen year old plain woman wakes up with labor pains , gives birth in a calving pen , cuts the umbilical cord and prays , lord , please make this go away when she awakens and the baby is no longer with her , she whispers , denke , and goes on with her day later , after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate , she tells them i did n't have a baby , as blood trickles down her leg without providing spoilers , two \( of many \) implausible situations follow first , two women , one old , one young , both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse , defying the odds of fertility second , a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity free farm out of the kindness of her heart in summary , a two page italicized section mid book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages those interested in reading just one book by jodi picoult should choose my sister 's keeper chris bohjalian 's midwives is better
i will not be passing it on to a friend the ending left me irritated why should i close a book with questions in my head \? i will not buy another picoult book i felt snookered by keeping faith and now i have been fooled twice
the writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense i thought something might change , that it might become an interesting ghost story , or there might be moral issues , or maybe even a character would grow or change the heavy handed ending is , perhaps , intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones but that 's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness are we supposed to take everything that ellie says about the amish in court \( peaceful , gentle , incapable of murder , loving , child centric , willing to accept an out of wedlock child into the community \) as lies \? the ending belongs to a much darker book my biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing , i kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story
i have read several of ms picoult 's books and i think this was the best yet the writing was so great , i was taken right into the amish countryside
like all of the jodi picoult novels i 've read to date , this one slides down as easily as ice cream she is a masterful storyteller , with the ability to pull you into a time and place , and an extraordinary family situation plain truth tells the story of an amish girl by the name of katie fisher and the lawyer , ellie hathaway , who defends her in a murder trial katie is accused of neonaticide , killing a baby she refuses to admit she delivered even though it is a medically indisputable fact that she has just given birth
this book was the best i have read of picoult , though i do n't think she knows how to write a bad one ! it explores the amish community and the story takes place in that setting
this was my first time reading a jodi picoult book and i really do n't think i will attempt another one the plain truth was painfully long , boring and repetitive every character was annoying and unbelievable especially ellie and katie \( the main two \) i kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of hannah but it never came just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in the beginning is the only part of the book i found interesting it went downhill \( extremely slowly \) after that
plain truth tells the story of an amish girl , katie fisher , charged with the murder of her infant child immediately after she gave birth to it out of wedlock ellie hathaway , a hot shot defense atorney gets suckered into taking the case though circumstance and extended family ellie herself has a biological clock like a timebomb about to explode and ca n't reconcile her feelings about having her own child with how katie apparently killed her own child
after reading five of her novels , i have become a fan of jodi picoult i will admit \( and this probably proves that i am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself \) that i 've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that did n't make it on the list
for love is a subdued , mature chronicle of a woman coming to terms with adult relationships this book tells the story of lottie , a woman haunted by her and her new husband 's pasts the tone is detached with the author perhaps purposefully distancing the readers from intense emotion themes in the book include love \( of course \) both romantic and familial , identity , loyalty , maturation , and conscious living it is not a tale packed with action though it decidedly lures us with a what will ever happen \? plot thread sue miller nimbly and impressively weaves the plot back and forth through time and through the emotional state of the protaganist \( lottie \) it is a first person account told in third person \( hence the distancing \) this device may be used to emulate the lack of connection and knowledge lottie has with and of herself this book presents the simple unfolding of a story completed with brilliant technique and subtlety would i recommend this book \? yes it contains simple life truths which provoke soul searching and contemplation to whom would i recommend it \? patient readers those willing to take the time to meander with the author and the protangonist through the often stream of consciousness narration was this book life changing for me \? yes it helped me wrap my mind around two ideas that while very intuitive seemed very fresh and enrichming for me 1 \) when we love people , that love will either stretch to include all different versions of them as they grow and change , or it wo n't lasting love takes work in that regard how is this work done \? this leads me to idea 2 \) sometimes we have to pretend to love the changed version of a person we once loved \( or pretend to embrace the true nature person who we idealized as something else \) until that love can adapt and become a reality will this book change the way i live \? it will change my perspective if the book 's philosophy is correct and thought follow actions then yes it will have changed my life i enjoyed this book for it 's unlikely marriage of depth and simplicity
the relationships between the various characters were n't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character , lottie , at all the book seemed to ramble on , and did n't catch my interest there were a few parts where the action picks up , but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
all the characters in this book were shallow , selfish and boring the writing was good but i could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters
i enjoyed this book , but then again i always enjoy sue miller 's novels she has this way of making me feel close to her main characters so anyway sue , is lottie ok \? has she found contentment in life \? please write me at babz aol com i am about to read the distinguished guest i heard it was really great ! i 'll let you know bar
this is an excellant book for people seeking answers to living life to its fullest siddhartha learned the lessons the hard way and through his journey we then learn those same lessons and find out just how simple they really are i recommend reading this book again as most of us have probably read it years ago
people that say this book changed your life and that if you get it it is the best book and the only book you need , clearly did n't get the book that is the antithesis of one of the main points of the book the point is that teaching is wrong , striving to learn is wrong you have to find the answers within yourself , you have to truly see and hear yourself without your ego clouding the truth this is the way to happiness and enlightenment the point of this book is that you cannot learn what it shows tells you you must find it within yourself , you must experience it yourself the point is that a book on enlightenment on spirituallity can never truly show you these things can never bring enlightenment to you , that is something that must be discovered within yourself you must strive for it , go through hardships for it , it cannot be handed to you or it loses all value
seriously , if you 're gonna read siddhartha , this is certainly the edition to get the slightly oversized penguin classics one
this book is simply amazing ! and when i say simply , i also mean that it is an interestingly simple book very short and concise and yet filled with so much knowledge and meaning it really is a treatise on life itself
i bought this item together with other photography books and i am very pleased with it the author , michael langford , \( yes the same guy who wrote the highly acclaimed basic photography \) distilled the lessons into 101 easy tips that is a great help for beginners who wanted to get their feet wet immediately
my 15 year old son , who of course is an expert on everything , reluctantly read this compact book and admitted that he learned quite a bit from it he certainly takes good pictures so we certainly got our moneys worth
this little book is great ! it was one of many books that i bought when i took my first my first round with an slr i really got more out of it than several of the more impressive \( expensive \) books that i bought ! i carried it around in my camera bag forever and referred to it many times then when my daughter showed an interest in photography it is the one i picked to get her started if you are just starting out do n't sweat the 5 bucks
i recently bought a canon rebel 2000 and need a small simple book with guidelines on taking better pictures in a variety of different situations this book is wonderful ! ! ! gives many real life examples and shows sample pictures of everything the author talks about a must for anyone wanting to take better pictures
this book is small enough to fit in your pocket or camera bag yet , it 's full of useful tips accompanied by demonstrative full color photographs personally , i find it to be a great reference on vacations , i always bring it along as plane reading material so that my skills are refreshed for travel photography it 's a must have for any amateur photographer
this is my 3rd nora roberts book i 've read the first 2 in the 3 sisters trilogy , and decided to read chesapeake blue while i \( very eagerly \) await face the fire in the mail perhaps i was spoiled by the characters , the conflicts , and the love stories in 3 sisters , but this book pales in comparison
i really enjoyed reading about seth and his life this book added so much humor to make the situations a bit more fun , especially since seth is still young reading about him as a man was far better than hearing about him when he was a boy however , a wonderful ending to a series
why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad \? after the wonderful quinn trilogy fans \( including me \) begged and begged for nora roberts to write seth 's story after all we journeyed with seth through we wanted to see him fall in love nora roberts repeatedly said she would not write one but us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it and we got chesapeake blue reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted seth 's story but this was n't what i \( and my fellow nr fans friends \) wanted first of all i wanted the heroine to be aubrey after their beautiful friendship in the quinn trilogy i expected her to be seth 's love interest but i tried to keep an open mind after all i loved anna , grace , and sybill , but dru whitcomb banks was a completely let down all she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what cam , ethan , philip , and seth experienced as children seth becoming an artist was a surprise too i expected him to join the family business and design boats the gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline there 's no reason gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that seth would n't tell his family considering the quinn brothers \( and wives \) worked their so hard to keep him away from her i closed this book vowing never to request , beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they do n't want to because this is what you get
i'm embarassed that i read this all the way through the language expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff i do n't live with people who talk like that , and i do n't understand the purpose sophistication \? to my mind , the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with s
it was great to return to the great characters in this family that nora roberts has created to see what time has visited them with , and what happens to the lost little boy in the original stories score another hit
i wanted to be there with the quinn brothers i loved the description of the chesapeake bay it 's very hard to explain how i felt i was a part of this book from beginning to end
the book was in good shape on first glance as i finished reading the book , the last 4 pages were torn making the top 1 3 of the page impossible to read it was frustrating but i was able to read the rest of the book and get the idea how the book ended
perfect ending to the prior three nora roberts novels chronicaling the lives of four brothers
more information than i never knew existed about national lampoon the extraordinary detail that josh karp uncovered to put this book together is absolutely amazing
i more or less forced myself to read the entire book because there were some great anecdotes and also several nodes of connectivity where someone famous first got their start working with some of the other persons mentioned in its pages
the title a futile and stupid gesture is , of course a quote from national lampoon 's animal house , one of the most beloved , successful , and influential films of the past 30 years doug kenney helped write that movie and played the role of stork , as well as writing the almost as adored caddyshack , along with being one of the first and most powerful editors of the legendary magazine national lampoon josh karp 's book is both a biography of kenney and a history of the whole lampoon scene , which because of the sway of the quasi spinoff saturday night live , becomes a social history of american comedy during the 1970 's and that decade was to comedy like the 1960 's was to rock a time which transformed show business and culture not just in the u s but in the whole western world the irony is that , as a woman who worked with the almost all male writers of that scene said of them , they were the most miserable bunch of guys i 've ever known
ever since esquire published their cover story on doug kenney , life and death of a comic genius , many years ago , i 've been hoping for a book like this to appear mention the name doug kenney to your co workers and see what sort of reaction you get until you start talking about national lampoon and animal house
about a year ago , i checked out this book from the school 's library \( i was very suprised they had a book on vegetarianism \) it has alot of information on becoming a vegetarian , has q a sections and tells you about different kinds of non meat diets , such as fruititarian , when you only eat fruit i think all children and teen vegetarians should read this book
this book is written in a very fun , age appropriate style it highlights many of the concerns and interests of the young vegetarian it includes jokes , recipes , information , comebacks , and even famous vegetarians a great read for the young vegetarian , especially one you may be afraid of losing to peer pressure note although veganism is mentioned , the book focuses on vegetarianism , not veganism
this volume contains 10 of heinlein 's future history stories written during the 1940 's
this collection of future history stories was first published in 1951 , and it consists of 9 short stories and one novella which were originally published between march of 1941 and december of 1949 the collection itself was recognized by fans in the astounding analog all time polls in 1952 and 1956 where it ranked 8th and 17th respectively the stories in this collection are chronological with respect to heinlein 's future history these are some of the classic stories from heinlein 's early writings this is definitely a must read for anyone who likes science fiction
as with any collection of short stories , there 's some variance in quality here several are three star , a few are four star , and two are five star the long watch is a great character study , with emphasis on loyalty , duty , conscience , and ethics the title story , the green hills of earth is a wonderful but tragic tale of heroism and bravery , reminiscent of what we saw in the nyfd on 9 11 01 these last two make the whole collection worth buying
i have an older copy of this book that my grandpa gave me i read and loved it i re read often
desoto presents an elegant model for the creation of capital in a society his examples focus on the infrastructure needed for capital formation , and they are clearly presented and explained in a historical context when applicable in a field \( economics \) that is riddled with disconnected academics , desoto pleases the reader by presenting a model based on primary research the reader also will enjoy desoto 's clever phrasings and sentence structure thorough citations will aid a learner in the advanced study of the argument , while clarity and elegance in support work will please a reader considering for the first time why capitalism seems to thrive only in the west
author is easy to read and understand he supports his main points very well with examples and data already bought two friends a copy as gifts
every now and then , a book comes along that opens our minds to an idea that can change the world , and in so doing changes us and reminds us why we read and search for that next great book with that next big idea i have a very short list of contemporary books like this , and mystery of capital is one of them
since the keynesian revolution the economics profession has been busy writing up mathematical models of incentives that show how imf and world bank loans , free trade deals , fiscal policy or game theory can be used by governments to generate economic growth hernando de soto 's mystery of capital is a slap in the face for every economist that has ever had a high paid position in the countless agencies built to promote growth it turns out that the classical economists \( and their austrian school heirs \) have been right all along , that the source of economic growth is individual businessmen and what can these individuals do when it takes a year of full time work and years of savings paid out in bribes to get a legitimate business license \? nothing the only people that can do business in these countries are the already wealthy and well connected
i enjoyed this book , particularly the legal history of property rights in the united states
in the mystery of capital , hernando de soto , president of peruvian think tank institute for liberty and democracy , seeks to explain \( as stated in his ambitious subtitle \) why capitalism triumphs in the west and fails everywhere else his answer is that western countries have developed flexible legal systems that recognize emerging property interests , especially in land
this book dispels may ill conceived notions people in developed world have about people in the rest of the world explains how the inability to put a value on assets in various parts of the world is a major cause for stymied growth and the reason for this inability to quantify assets stems from the extralegal ways in which the assets are obtained
let me see if i have got this right \? the only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way \? that way we all gain \? ok the bosses of nike , mcdonalds , and wal mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk , but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide \?
de soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights it 's incredibly difficult for poor people \( specifically , recent urban migrants \) to get legal title to their land as a result , the poor make extralegal arrangements , squatting on and using land that neighbors \( but not the government \) recognize as theirs but because they do n't own the land , they ca n't get a mortgage on their house to start a business , electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services , the government has difficulty taxing them because they do n't have a legal address , and so on and so on
an economist 's book written so regular folks can finally understand how and why capitalism is a distinctly american animal the mystery of capital provides a plain language explanation of the foundation and founding of capitalism in the us and why its export to third world and former communist nations have , thus far , been unsuccessful then it outlines logical methods necessary for making capitalism accessible in any country excellently researched , exceptionally well written
this is probably one of the best books i have read in this century we , elderly readers , have usually fair memories and can stack one writer against the other by every comparison , ms smith winns hands down her language is original and refreshing her characters very much alive if they suffer from common falacies she can treat all of it in very humane and understanding way the story she tells is fascinating , well conceived and even better executed the resolution is unusual in any case of all the young writers publishing in english currently \( and i 've read a few \) she is my favorite
at first , i thought that smith was mining the same ground as andrea levy 's small island examining the lives of immigrants in postwar london and tracing the routes that had brought them there but while smith does not quite have levy 's intensity , she spreads her net wider , dealing with several different cultures \( bengali , jamaican , jewish intellectual , and british working class \) over a span of three generations , only the first of which coincides with levy 's eventually it becomes clear that her main focus is on the youngest generation \( presumably her own \) , and she chronicles the troubled nineties with sharp observation , vivid and often colloquially profane language , and considerable humor i felt that the narrative lost coherence and the plotting became less plausible as the number of characters increased , though it may just be that i had less time to read but smith 's central theme the difficulty of maintaining cultural identity in a strange land is extremely well addressed and chillingly relevant
extremely insightful , witty , relevant , and pleasurable to read with the one major caveat that all the white women in the novel are one dimensional walking stereotypes who basically show up to seduce muslim men and then crawl away with no real exploration of their motives or thought processes by the author , unlike the ones afforded to all the novel 's other characters keeping this criticism in mind , read the book and enjoy it just try and find a white female character in the novel whose behavior does n't follow this trajectory
i do n't know where to start ! this novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent , shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence the descriptions of the dust bowl and the depression \( the period following the stock market crash of 1929 \) made me weep more than once the cast of characters calls to mind dickens , and the presence of artificial limbs is outright melvillian features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden , post columbian textual figure a must for teachers , students and parents who care about the rainforest
this is one of my favorite books it is a story about culture , the insecurity racked years of adolescence , lives of immigrant families and their kids in london zadie is a great story teller who brings all her characters to life with her descriptive writing and a wicked sense of humor i do n't like to give away much during my reviews so you 'll just have to read it to find out worth all the accolades it has received
it was in the last year of the second world war , while serving together as part of a tank crew , that archie jones met samad iqbal what resulted is a powerful but wacky bond between the hapless but easy going englishman and the better educated , but always underemployed and bitter , bengali muslim this close friendship also brought together their wives alsana , who was promised by her family at birth to marry samad , and clara , an extremely beautiful jamaican girl from a jehovah 's witness family , whose one flaw is that she has no upper front teeth 18 years old clara married the much older archie soon after meeting the middle aged man at a hippie new year 's eve party she was attending archie crashed the party after deciding not to go through with a suicide over his failed marriage to his italian warbride
a much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story the end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
zadie smith has filled white teeth with cultural tension that drips from every relationship samad worries that his sons are being corrupted like all the other children in england alsana does not ever want to go back to india because she feels her family is safe in england but samad would not agree that safe is as clear as alsana thinks it is the minds , traditions , rituals , and morality of his sons are being eroded and destroyed his sons are not safe to him , alsana is only thankful they are in england because she has swallowed it whole , believing the lie of safety that promises physical security while your cultural foundation is eaten away beneath you
this is a great little book a fairy tale with a twist there is an intelligent sweetness to it i think it fell down a little toward the end i would have liked it better if the darker plots hinted at in the beginning were not so quickly disposed of about two thirds of the way through not that i would wish darker consequences on the hero and heroine , but a little more complex working out of at least one of those sub plots would have improved the book still well worth reading charming
this is a fine piece of work by a talented author in essence it is a fairy tale for adults , written with some of the best prose i have ever read smooth and flowing however , read gaiman at your own risk his topics , sensibilities and shock value vary a great deal from book to book his books illustrate why some authors need to use pen names , so you can tell one type of writing from another
the great thing about reading gaiman 's work has always been his commitment to story telling whilst there undoubtably enough themes and issues in stardust for even the most pompous literary critic to sink their teeth in to the main strength of this book \( and indeed of most of gaiman 's work excluding his literary collaboraitons \) is its ability to fire you imagination
neil gaiman 's stardust takes place in a mystical version of england the town of wall is a tiny , safe and quiet village that is a bastion of safety from the outside world residents of the aptly named wall never venture outside of the village barriers and nobody from outside is allowed in , so as to keep wall safe villagers , in pairs , are assigned shift duties in protecting the gap that separates wall from the outside world
this is definitely , as alot of people say , a fairy tale for adults it is only such , however , because there is a sex scene i do n't recall there being alot of complicated or harsh language so it 's basically a children 's fairy tale with some adult content if you like children 's fairy tales , you will love stardust it is very well done , and the imagery is fantastic although they 're probably not the best books for comparision , i 'd say that if you 're an adult yet you still enjoy reading books like ella enchanted and the neverending story , you 'll like this one
this is a lovely mix of fantasy and faery gaiman 's characters and plot lines stack up with the brothers grimm , but he adds some flesh and personality but not too much personality we do n't get bogged down in introspective angst or belabouring the human condition he 's kept it simple , but managed charm over banality we 're carried along by the events , sure , but none of the characters are throwaways my favourite was the unnamed `little hairy person' the scene where tristan meets him is a cracker the magic feels magical , the innocents are good , the witches are bad , and the conventions work for gaiman , not against him moreover the mix of plots and subplots is pretty much seamless it 's unusual to not notice a few bumpy links here and there , but i just realised i did n't notice a thing \( well , maybe the topaz \)
i truly expected more from this but from beginning to end it seemed trite , unconvincing and entirely too derivative the characters fall flat and the writing is simplistic at least it is short
as i was reading the first few pages of the novel i thought it was boring that was so until the storyline developed in the succeeding chapters it held my attention and i only put it down when i had to \( lunch , dinner , bathroom trip , sleep things such as those \) i found tristran thorn 's character very handsome , especially when he set out for a journey beyond the wall to retrieve a fallen star for his love
this is my first book by this author , and i honestly feel like i might like the story after the fact , if the author did n't ruin all the punchlines in the book the fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like i was being beat over the head with a did you get it \? stick i also thought he was over doing the fairytale theme , with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks
very good in the sequel line , but i figured out who dun it before i finished the characters are still developing well , waiting for the next one i have the whole series
boulder , colorado author , margaret coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal it 's always two looks ahead , of everybody else , she says using the wolf as metaphor , she gets the villain in her mystery novel the eye of the wolf at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters
margaret coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the wind river reservation in wyoming and describes the arapahoe customs in wonderful detail in this installment , father o'malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the arapahoe and shoshone indians has been re ignited , and that dead indians can be found on an ancient battle ground when father o'malley goes to investigate , he discovers three dead shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles things heat up when the young shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends vicky holden , the other main character in the series , has entered into a law partnership with adam lone eagle , and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling vicky wants to defend frankie montana , who is a suspect in the murders , and adam tries to persuade her not to take frankie as a client as always , author coel creates a wonderful setting and characters , and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series
it is hard to believe that margaret coel began her wind river reservation series some ten years ago with the eagle catcher , which introduced readers to father john o'malley and defense attorney vicky holden each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between o'malley and holden the latest installment in this series is no exception
the poetic macabre message shakes up father john o'malley , the jesuit pastor at st francis on the wind river plantation the caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths not long afterward , at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the shoshone betrayed the arapaho to the cavalry , three shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here
eye of the wolf by margaret coel isbn 0425205460 due out today \( 6 september 2005 \) i was sent an arc of this great book to read for review which i do gladly i had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them , especially spirit woman and story teller , so was expecting good things i was not disappointed the series follows the adventures of father john o'malley , pastor of st francis mission on the wind river reservation and tribal attorney , vicki holden and apart from a ripping good mystery , the author weaves the history of the arapho and the soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well , bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life it is not hard to care about the indian priest as they call father john or vicky holden i think what i enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well they were brought vividly alive by the author 's words from the first mystery message this is for the indian priest , everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield but does it \? \? this is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish
it 's always fun to read a best seller from almost 20 years ago , especially one that was proclaimed as something of a classic at the time it 's even more enjoyable to discover that tom wolfe 's the bonfire of the vanities proves worthy of its acclaim even with the absence of cell phones , email and instant messaging
if you like quality writing , this is it ! mr wolfe is extremely talented at painting an entire scene with words that leave you feeling like you are there character , scene , and plot development all have depth and i 'll have to disagree with an earlier review that said the characters were n't believable they were entirely human with all the rich exceptions that make a person who he or she is i also disagree with the comment that the book , itself , was racist no , the book was n't , but some of the characters were , which was a point that mr wolfe was attempting to make about them because their racism had to do with the larger story i will most definitely read mr wolfe again because of his extraordinary writing abilities that said , i was completely disappointed with the ending , both because of specifically how he chose to end it and because of its weakness the ending lacked the full bodied development that mr wolfe gave to the rest of the story
when entering the competitive , cut throat professional world , where stories abound of the dorm mate who just landed the six figure job at goldman sachs , the bonfire of the vanities just may help you maintain the precious altruism that you grew up with
wolfe hero worships the irish , and all others rank below them
regarded by some as the essential literary representation of 1980s america , bonfire of the vanities was written during the economic boom and urban crime waves of that decade and published almost as the stock market crashed in 1987 it follows the lives of a group of characters who express new york city 's ethnic , socio economic , and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly publicized case of hit and run a car belonging to sherman mccoy of park avenue , one of wall street 's most successful bond brokers , accidentally strikes a young black man in the bronx with the injured man in a coma , harlem preacher , politician , and general rabble rouser rev reginald bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious district attorney abe weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist peter fallow prosecutor lawrence kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy wasp in the name of equality and streetwise irish lawyer tommy killian may be mccoy 's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything
i did n't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when i read it , and i do n't understand it any better today a lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties , but that was only a tiny part of the novel stick to liar 's poker or bombardiers for a better look
many will remember the movie made of this my advice \? do n't i was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film , but , finally decided to give it a go \( despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover \) this book is an example of what a meticulous , fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him while being a great 'page turner' as far as plot goes , wolfe manages , through a complex web of ironies and double ironies , to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place hands down one of the most enteratining novels that i have ever read , and definitely the best rendering of modern new york city in fiction ! this paperback was so ubiquitous i waited 10 years to reluctantly read it , and only because it was one of the only books on the shelf where i was staying boy , was i rewarded with this compulsively readable , suspenseful , razor sharp story for social satire to be so fiendishly plotted is a real treat and this story will have you racing to its inexorable conclusion
bonfire of the vanities has long been hailed as one the greatest \( the greatest \? \) american novels of the 1980 's , and its accolades bear little use repeating nevertheless , a new look at this classic novel provides ample proof that while many aspects of society have changed in the nearly two decades since bonfire was published , a great many other have , sadly , not just add starbucks , the internet , and cellular phones you 'll find that the world described by this novel is very much alive in gotham today
for me , at the beginning there was an intrest in how all of these people related together what could a bronx defense attorney have to do with this guy that makes a ton of money on wall street \?
i can just echo the substance of remarks of the other reviewers on the contents as an avid reader of mystery fiction , i can visualize opening a page at random and picking my next book to read as a computer programmer , i look at books like this and envision how i would write the program that would generate this information if the author did not use a computer program , i am doubly impressed this book should be on the shelf of every crime fiction aficionado if not on your shelf then that of your local library
the brilliant author writer wordmaster pat conroy has always been my favorite all time author i love his style , his way with words , his storylines , dialogue , description , and masterful similes another conroy fan once e mailed me , asking if i knew anyone else who wrote as well as conroy well , i did a search and asked some of amazon 's top reviewers and they admitted they could n't find anyone comparable in style , etc
this was my first jodi picoult book and still my favorite i love her writing style the way she switches between characters keeps it interesting a real surprise ending , dont read the end and ruin it for yourself
what a very touching story that with stem cell research , could be true ! the author tells a gripping story through each characters' perspective this is a story that stays with you for a long , long time ! !
the emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable i found myself sobbing on more than one occasion terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment i identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared
a very interesting probe into a practice that is not too far from home any parent can identify with the pain of having a child with health problems , and the moral dilemna of having to choose one child over another is full of anguish well written and enjoyed by all i have shared this with
very well written , and presents ethical challenges of having one child to save another the emotional status of each family member in a family with a dying child is well represented these feelings and assigned roles took place in my own family so i can say with certainty the author hit the nail on the head in examining the individual impact
this was a fantastic book it really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness the story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister organ donor i really felt compelled to side with the well sister , but as a parent i could empathize with the parents as well this book will keep you up late until it 's finished a great read

harry bosch and his partner kiz rider are working cold cases and they come up with one harry worked 13 years earlier a case harry has not been able to lay to rest connelly is at the top of his game with this one the plot moves along at a rapid pace though several twists and turns never a dull moment on a personal note , i grew up in southern california and i'm still a die hard dodger fan so , the little bit of history about echo park , chavez ravine and how dodger stadium came to be was all very interesting to me a thoroughly enjoyable read
back from retirement , detective harry bosch is still haunted by the kidnap and disappearance of marie gesto from 1993 now serial killer raynard waits is willing to lead police to marie 's grave as part of a plea bargain ensuring he will not receive the death penalty when waits escapes during the outing and the tape filming the event is obviously doctored , harry suspects politics and career advancement are involved and that , perhaps , waits had n't killed marie after all but only been told how to find her grave
there is nobody , and i mean nobody who writes this genre better than connelly he does n't muck up bosch 's life with unrealistic actions or relationships i thought he was coming too close to it with walling , but thankfully he let bosch be who he really is a flawed man , an honorable yet somewhat unhonorable cop , and a great detective i was glad it was nearly pure storyline , without the ex wife and daughter present as well i do n't want to see connelly take bosch the lucas davenport route
harry bosch is a detective working for lapd 's open unsolved unit marie gesto 's 1996 disappearance , a case to which bosch was assigned when he was in homicide , was never solved her clothes were found neatly folded on the front seat of an abandoned car parked in the garage of a vacant luxury apartment but her body was never recovered and the case has eaten at bosch ever since thirteen years later , raynard waits was pulled over in his van in the early morning hours in echo park but the traffic stop turned out to be far from routine the officers discovered two trash bags in the van that contained the dismembered body parts of two women in an effort to avoid the death penalty , waits and his lawyer , maurice swann , negotiate a deal with the prosecuting attorney , rick o'shea , in which waits confesses to nine murders including marie gesto 's and promises to lead the police to the location of her long buried body
harry bosch had been working for the lapd 's open unsolved unit , although there were many endless cases through the years unresolved , it was one case in particular that had been haunting him bosch remained transfixed by it , pulling the file several times a year in the hope to discover some new information , something missed , a fresh lead , just anything , wanting more than ever to give closure to this victim 's parents and also to himself , but the criminal remains still at large , one who still walks the streets and this makes bosch nervous
michael connelly shows why he is the best writer within his genre harry bosch receives a call that there is a confessor to the murder of a young woman from 1993 harry worked the case and it has haunted him for over a decade
once again michael connelly proves he is top shelf when it comes to crime drama i was first introduced to connelly , like many via the 2002 clint eastwood pseudo flop blood work i had no desire to see another creation of connelly whatsoever a year later i was at a book signing for one of john sandford 's prey books and he recommended i give connelly another try i picked up the poet and that was all i needed i can sum it up like this no one writes flawed and f'ed up characters like connelly no one !
fans of michael connelly and his series revolving around detective harry bosch will not be disappointed with his newest novel echo park
once again , i was thoroughly entertained with a michael connelly novel featuring my favorite detective , harry bosch no matter how long ago the crime was committed , harry will solve it not only with his tenaciousness , but because he happens to care this well written , compelling story grabbed me from the beginning the twists and turns were spot on and the ending was oh so satisfying
i first discovered michael connelly \( through amazon ! \) because i was a stephen j cannell fan i 've read all of cannell 's books , and especially liked his novels about detective shane scully if you are familiar with cannell 's work you will enjoy connelly just as much he writes an engaging story , with believable characters and dialogue it was a pleasure to read , with good pacing , interesting plot , and a satisfying ending his heroes have flaws the same as cannell 's do but you know their sense of honor will win the day ! a very good read
this book is well written and easy to understand it addresses specific issues which confront people in modern society who feel the need to reconnect with their inmost self , as well as offering methods for doing so i highly recommend it
this is an excellent book for moving forward in your life and finding your true self i have felt stuck and confused for many years about the direction my life should take and this book has helped me to change that the activities the author recommends open your everyday mind to your subconscious or soul as the author calls it this has been a life changing book for me and is helping me to finally understand what it really means to grow up if you feel stuck and as though your story has gooten too small for you then it is time to read this book
i was drawn to bill plotkin 's book the week it was released over time i have gone back to this profound message and taken more to use in my life as i work toward life purpose , life intention the 'coincidences' of his story are nothing less than the spiritual power of life itself that we all experience every day , if we only take time to decide to be open for them powerful truths for heart and soul in these trying years of an old and tortured world there is peace and hope
this book is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense it contains endless statements making no sense i was truly looking forward to a book that would be a refreshing alternative to most pop psychology that 's on the market instead i got a text that was written by someone who could n't think it was full of illogical , unsupported statements and arguments if i could , i would demand my money back i'm that upset with my purchase i definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has any ability to think whatsoever
over the past few days i have been slowly reading each page of bill plotkin 's pivotal work soulcraft i had read it a few months before i completed a vision quest with the non profit he founded in 1980 , www animas org , but it was a completely different book then now , having experienced the profundity of his western based soul initiation process in the form of a animas valley vision quest , i have revisited his life 's work and boy is it good ! no , great ! no , outstanding !
soulcraft is a must read for any individual seeking meaning to their life through soul connection the book is unpretentious , easy to read , yet profound bill takes us on a journey of his and various other individuals' lives at the same time , he offers us practical tools to engage in our own soul journey soulcraft will make many of us want to go on a vision quest to encounter our deepest fears with the intention of reconnecting to our soul and living our divine purpose
i am currently translating this book into the german language it is the most exciting translation i have done in the last years even though i am only copying it down it has already changed my life in a profound way i am very thankful for the destiny that put this book on my desk and i know that there was no coincidence involved
what do you get when you cross a jungian oriented depth psychologist , an ecotherapist , and a wilderness guide of the highest caliber \? and then what do you do \? the answer to the first question is bill plotkin , director of animas valley institute \( www animas org \) the answer to the second spend 20 years creating a way to approach soul in a culture that over the years has lost its ways of soul connection that once were as natural as walking upright half guidebook , half storybook , and half pure poetry , soulcraft crossing into the mysteries of nature and psyche by bill plotkin describes his lifelong work in discovering and developing nature and the outer wilderness as mirrors for our inner nature and inner wilderness in soulcraft , bill tries to compile and present approaches to the mystery of our souls and what mary oliver calls our place in the family of things of the many fruits one can take away from the stories and practices bill describes in soulcraft , i think four of the juiciest are \( 1 \) his distinction between spirit and soul , \( 2 \) his approach to dreamwork , \( 3 \) his belief that soul work , while not promising any easy answers to the harsh realities of life , certainly makes life more interesting , and \( 4 \) the practices that lead to cultivating a soulful relationship to life
david mccullough 's 1776 , an account of the american revolution from the declaration of war in october of 1775 to the battle at princeton in january of 1777 , is well researched history told by a master story teller the skill of the author is elegantly focused on the details of the boston siege , the rout at new york , the battle of fort washington , and the turning point battle of trenton
at the crest of a hill on 150th street , in jamaica , queens , a simple unobtrusive boulder with a bronze inscription announces that it was at that spot the battle of long island was fought in 1776 the british had travelled throughout the night probably along what is now hillside avenue to take the american rear by surprise at dawn the fact that the plaque sits on someone 's front lawn , and is a brief ten minute walk from my apartment is a reminder that before the asphalt and brick that predominate the landscape , our nation was taking its first , precarious steps toward nationhood
this is my first book by mccullough , but i doubt it will be the last his ability to breathe life into history is uncanny , as so many others here attest this book covers the revolutionary war from the declaration of war in october of 1775 through the battle at princeton in january of 1777 it is a history of the military campaign , so much of the political maneuvering is non existant , instead focusing on the continental army and its travails against the british army , british navy , and mother nature
1776 is a nice general read on the events corresponding to the first significant year of the revolution david mccullough is a nice story teller , but he is not a military historian such was not the intent of this book what i like is that its a nice , fast moving narrative on the 1776 campaign thank god we do n't have another rehash of the signing of the declaration of independence , with franklin , jefferson et al doing all their careful draghts mccullogh , the voice of history on public tv , was sensible not to drag the reader through that well known territory again
i read 1776 shortly sfter having read mccullough 's john adams so some of the same ground was covered but from a different perspective , i found 1776 to be an interesting and smoothly flowing read anyone who has enjoyed and appreciated david mccullough 's other works will enjoy 1776
david mccullough does an outstanding job of presenting history as a living entity george washington , among others , is portrayed as very human , i e , not always knowing what to do or how to do it the supporting documentation is fantastic i would n't have thought that ordinary communications , e g , letters from an ordinary soldier to his family , would still exist and be available to flesh out our understanding of events which were undoubtedly chaotic at the time this is not your usual history book , at least not like the history books that i read from elementary school through college
thanks book is superb an easy read non fiction that reads like a great novel
1776 does an outstanding job of personalizing the key figures who became so critical in the war for independence although the year 1776 saw repeated military defeats for the americans , the faint glimmer of hope is apparent as the americans begin to turn the tide in a series of minor victories that kept the morale at a manageable point
i like the novels of clare boylan \( holy pictures her first novel was a bit overstuffed and almost crazed in its scope , but it was memorable and a page turner nontheless \) in emma brown , boylan takes 20 sparse pages of notes from bronte for a novel that was fated never to be written and she fleshes it out it does n't read at all like bronte the crisp prose is missing and this is definitely in boylan 's more ornate voice
in emma brown , author clare boylan takes two chapters of an unfinished novel left behind by charlotte bronte and turns them into a complete novel in doing so , she incorporates other pieces of bronte 's writing , including a short story published by her husband after her the result , while perhaps not what bronte herself intended \( we 'll never know \) , is a rich , multi layered novel that makes for an engaging read
clare has created a polished work from scanty beginnings it is not , despite the blurbs , bronte 's voice it is certainly a modern work but it is a stimulating read nonetheless the characters are well developed and sympathetic , and drew me in to the mystery the plot is well timed , adding in new facets just as they are needed
i would absolutely recommend this novel to those who can appreciate victorian literature i was an english major in college and find myself incredibly bored by most contemporary writers ms boylan does an excellent job of writing in bronte 's style while it is obvious that the work is not entirely bronte 's , as one of the other review mentioned , that is besides the point the book is thoroughly enjoyable and a great read !
while the writing was acceptable , i felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced the differnce between the classes is too obvious the contrast between the rich world \( the students in the wilcox school and the cornhills \) and the streets of london \( and isa 's forced marriage to the grocer , and mrs cornhill 's predictable and obvious snobbery \) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice i was left cold by the overall plot one thing that truly bothered me was the fate of mr cornhill and isa i felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired , and was not in true bronte style the characters and their development also left something to be desired they were too predictable at times , and mr ellin was just annoying there were few occasions when i sympathized with any character , other than isa \( and only at certain points in the plot \) there was nothing spectacular about this novel , though i wo n't discourage anyone from reading it it was fast paced and it did hold my interest
based on 20 pages of an unfinished charlotte bronte manuscript , you forget that it was written in 2004 and are quickly enjoying what feels like a long lost bronte ! ms boylan takes into consideration charlotte 's growing concern \( at the time of her death \) with children born into extreme poverty and deprivation the plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan \( emma \) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to london 's back streets of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel
it 's nearly impossible to recreate another author 's writing style in fact , clare boylan undoubtedly took this project on knowing that it could possibly subject her to all manner of abuse nevertheless , i think she did an excellent job
this is a new victorian novel , starting with 2 chapters that were written by charlotte bront clare boylan did a good job , finishing what bront started it must be difficult to finish something someone else started , let alone that person being the famous writer c bront is ! ! !
stormy weather was the first hiaasen novel i read i picked up a paperback copy at a remainder sale never heard the name of the guy and did n't expect much but it was cheap , and so
great characters , the book stays true to its genre without losing the element of surprise good summer read
given the recent hurricanes katrina and rita that hit the united states in the past year , 'stormy weather , ' by carl hiaasen , seemed like a timely read this novel tells a story of tourists , native floridians , scam artists , and insurance adjusters as they interact in miami after a hurricane strikes
once again , hiassen proves he is an amazing writer most thrillers need an intricate story to propel them forward to keep a reader turning pages
i admit i was suspect when i first picked up this set and saw ed asner was reading stormy weather carl hiaasen books get pretty raunchy at times and i was not sure i could listen to ed asner reading about hot and dirty action i was pleased to find my misgivings to be unfounded the consummate actor mr asner brings stormy weather to life with a dry , sardonic wit that fits the material and allows the listener to get to know the characters and revel in their adventures and misadventures
hiaasen as his best ! what better way to write an adventurous novel about florida than to incorporate the act of god that plagues us most a hurricane ! ! ! but what most people do not think of , that hiaasen has lived through , is the crazy aftermath of said hurricane lack of fresh water , food and ice cannot drive away those hell bent on insurance fraud , roofing scams , or the crazed tourist that wants to capitalize on some original footage of the events as they unfold
having read and enjoyed the author 's young adult book hoot , and looking for a light adult read , i picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light frankly , it was both of thos things , but within a hundred pages , it became eminently easy to put down i enoy a diversion reading book periodically , and have some adult writers that meet those needs , thomas perry and harold adams to name two this one did n't make it for me it seemed to be a lot of given a hurricane , one darn thing after another for a group of characters i did n't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together
this is the first hiaasen book that i read and i was impressed most lines were witty and hiaasen is one natural satirist \) even though there are plenty of characters with intertwined lives , i never got lost and i believe almost all of them were given enough space for the character to evolve i have acquired more of his books here in manila and i ca n't wait to read them
great sense of timing and humor this was the first book of his i 've read but i ca n't wait to buy the rest of his works keeps me up late at night giggling
if you believe that there 's a little good in everyone , then stormy weather and carl hiaasen are not for you
when this book was first presented to me i was not to thrilled to read it , but when i did i found myself in tears this book moved me to a place that i did n't know existed , it is powerful and heartbreaking i recomend it to anyone who needs a good cry
this is a beautiful story about an idyllic childhood and the loss of innocence the kite runner follows the story of amir , the son of a wealthy businessman in afghanistan , and hassan , the son of amir 's father 's servant as children the boys are inseparable until a horrible event changes them and their lives forever amir and his father flee to america during the take over of afghanistan by the soviets while in america amir continues to be haunted by the tragic childhood event while he finally grows close to his father events lead him back to afghanistan and eventually amir finds a way to redeem himself
sometimes we must step out of our own culture or ideologies to glimpse the mindset and pain of another i know that i 've read a great book when it haunts me days after i 've read it this book did just that the characters were raw and real and flawed the details and setting were rich the story was difficult to read at times , but the reality is that life is filled with both beautiful and horrible moments i look forward to reading the next book by khaled hosseini
the kite runner is the story of two boys growing up in the tragedy that has been the last thirty years of afghanistan 's history
this is quite possibly my favorite read of the year it 's really eye opening to the ways of afghanistan before all hell broke loose heart wrenching ! a beautiful story of a father son just trying to make it in america , and a story of true friendship love
the kite runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up , stay focused , and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
what made this story so exceptional to me was the plain fact that every human in every culture wrestles with conscience and questions of truth
hari kunzru 's debut is reminiscent of john irving 's son of the circus with its east meets west main character and his many comic escapades there 's a little poisonwood bible thrown in as the same character , in one his guises , ends up with a demented missionary in darkest africa the writing shifts from the ridiculous to the sublime overall an entertaining read bringing promise of more to come from a talented young \( 30 year old \) author
the impressionist is an interesting book for me , it was so engrossing , that i realized its faults only when i almost finished reading
it has been quite a while since i have read a book that has touched me so deeply perhaps having lived several years on the indian sub continent colors my opinion , but i cannot help but believe that anyone who enjoys a fine , well crafted tale would not enjoy this book if you are looking to be transported \( in beautiful writing style \) to another place and time , buy this book !
with wit and empathy , this fantastic novel compassionately tells the life of a boy born from a wild and improbably union romping through brothels in india , sex parties , and the streets of london , the reader remembers how fortunate we are sometimes to have a place of familiarity
i found the parts of the book about the flexbility of identity and race interesting the boy liquidly moves through the novel adapting to new classes , races and environments he demonstrates the poignant struggle to be oneself and part of one 's culture and the simultaneous desire to be other however , this book narrator author is fixated on sex the boy 's life seems to revolve around sex more than the aforementioned issues , and the discussions about sex have absolutely no reason to be in the novel in fact , it draws away from the momentum there are parts where the narrator is describing a person in an insightful and interesting way , but then throws in a comment about the man 's pulsating bulge or something equally ridiculous i do n't have problems with sexuality or sexual novels , but it had absolutely no point in this book and drew away from the central issues of class and race and you 'll notice to book is heavily discounted hm
i picked this novel up because , for years , i 've been idly tossing around an idea for a course in racial ambiguity that looks at figures of mixed race in literature and culture this debut novel follows its half indian , half white protagonist through the various identities he inhabits in his trajectory through various scenes of british colonialism kunzru 's real narrative gift is his humor the first and second sections of this novel are written with a cocky , satirical aplomb reminiscent of henry fielding \( whom i happened to be reading at the same time still , i think the comparison holds \) after these sections come to an end , not even halfway through the book , the humor wanes and so does the story 's allure i think kunzru could have learned a lesson from the master , fielding that one of the benefits of having a shape shifting protagonist is that he can serve as a foil to set off the more captivating maneuvers of an intelligent narrator as the novel becomes more intent on developing the characters , the narrator fades , which is very disappointing

ca n't remember when i have been so captivated by a novel the reviewers who complain that the main character has n't much depth are right but they do n't really get that this is the whole point kunzru is making a comment on the flexibility of identity pran 's initial identity is a lie \( although he does n't know it \) , subsequent identities are forced upon him by necessity and others' needs and expectations , and he eventually learns that he can manipulate his own identity to his advantage an absolutely stunning , yet playful , story that demonstrates the ways in which we perceive ourselves and others and how we shape personal and cultural values outstanding i ca n't recommend it highly enough and wish i could give it 10 stars
i am not one who ca n't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance however , after half of this book i had to toss it away because there was nothing redeeming about it every character we encounter is wicked and sexually deranged i need a shred of hope to contine reading especially if i am to endure such explicit rape scenes ugh
don stoner is pretty much damned if he does and damned if he does n't , advocate an old earth creationist position on the one hand , he faces empirical data that demonstrates clearly the age of the universe he actually focuses on the scientific evidence and shows quite clearly using the data obtained from quasars and pulsars and the resultant red shifting demonstrated in the light spectrums that unless one accepts the implausable possibility that the speed of light has not always been constant , the universe is billions of years old he then makes a compelling argument that if scripture is to be taken as true it cannot be at odds with the truth of the creation itself
this book fights the spiritual war against the end justifies the means young earth cult if you paid hard earned money to send your children to a christian school \( as i have \) only to have them exposed to hideous kent hovind videos , you will appreciate this book 's clear exposition of the young earth fallacy i never understood how world war ii germany could follow hitler until the young earth propaganda machine deceived so many christians i hope others will join me in loaning a copy of this book to a young earth follower in their area this book does a great job in challenging us to reduce the young earth following by taking a stand for god 's truth
stoner begins by warning that unscientific books written by christians bring discredit upon christianity and drive non christians away from the gospel unfortunately , following this thinking , stoner may be a major culprit he simply accepts standard uniformitarian thinking as fact his treatment of dating methods appears to show a complete misunderstanding of them he says , for instance , that the circular reasoning of using fossils is obviated by the fact that fossils are used for dating only when they first have been shown to agree with isotopic dates first of all , index fossils , and the concepts behind using them , were used for over a century before isotopic dating even existed second , one of the major ways that dating results are evaluated for presumed reliability is their agreement with relative dating based on index fossils consequently , the circular reasoning still stands
some editions \( in fact , most of them \) do not tell you that this is actually the third in a series of books about the character mitch rapp i was not aware that this was a series until they made numerous references to previous activities flynn tries to catch the reader up , but it mostly ends up as a blur to the uninitiated reader
i could not put this book down vf keeps the story moving quickly and paints great mental pictures if you like clancy you will love flynn
at the beginning when the book tells us about saddam hussein i thought that this 'll be as many books written about him when the book turns out to be an internal affair is when you get thrilled the book has some pages that said nothing about the main plot but you 'll get hooked till the end this is my first book by vf and i'm looking forward to read more of him
as a political thriller , this book was heavy on the political and not so much on the thriller the prior two books , term limits and transfer of power were more action packed as a fan of the series , however , i do recommend this third book in the series there are a large number of characters returning from the prior two books , so i 'd definitely recommend reading the series in order
i have just finished this book i have read all of vince flynn 's previous books and i have enjoyed all of them if you are looking for a good book pick this one up
vince flynn strikes again with anohter spellbinding mitch rapp novel of intrigue and politics in a not so fictional us government
a disclaimer for this book to fully enjoy it , you really need to read term limits and transfer of power first there are a lot of characters here that were in the previous two books trying to digest all of them at the same time might be a little rough
another thriller from vince flynn like mitch rapp , this guy just does n't miss ! ! he 's that good real , real good ! ! no , he 's great ! !
simply put , this was an outstanding book if you are a guy then vince flynn 's books are for you lots of action with just a touch of romance you become very attached to the characters , epsically rapp and rieley in the mitch rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that , very well written i am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but i finished this book in two days , impossible to put down
in an unrelenting quest to understanding the history of the united states , one obscure name comes to mind , thomas paine paine helped establish the meaning of democracy and the united in united states his two monumental works , common sense and rights of man , provided the philosophical and rhetorical building blocks that the founding fathers , such as thomas jefferson and benjamin franklin , et al , would emulate with the writing of the declaration of independence and the bill of rights many take for granted the origins of freedom and democracy in the united states , and as with many school history textbooks depict , paine merely appears in a paragraph or two , and quickly disappears to historical oblivion
i discovered paine about five years ago , and just the knowledge that a man like him lived was very uplifting to me if only american schools would teach more of paine a true friend of man and one who truly understood what society needs , if all men and especially their leaders thought like thomas paine , our world would be farther , much farther ahead not in mere progress , but in true , meaningful betterment and would be as close to heaven as one could imagine
pleasantly surprised , until recently i thought all of your fathers of this stolen land was for slavery with the exception of john quincy adams and benjamin franklin refreshing to know that there was another , in my opinion , open minded and understanding the real meaning that all men are created equal ! ! ! ! ! ! how can a government have those high minded ideals practice slavery and genocide of the indigenous population of turtle island
i have just finished reading age of reason and i am ordering another copy to loan to friends paine said it best if i am wrong , prove it ! in detail , he proves that the bible is an anonymous , disjointed , plagiarised , conglomeration that is unworthy of mother goose that said , he outlines the concepts of deism that honors god as well as the rational mind
then you have to read this book thomas paine was so amazing , not only did his writings \( along with him personally \) influence the colonial revolution , but it also heavily influenced the french revolution !
thomas paine , in short , was brilliant ! looking to the evidence of nature for the existnce of god and not to man made altered doctrines that have caused 98 of the wars ever fought , and 90 of the deaths ever claimed by war why should we as humans push aside the only life that we know for sure we will have in hope for another what you see is what you get , is as far as it goes at least that is all we know for sure faith is good , i do say that , but when faith starts pushing reality to the side is when we have a problem
thomas paine is one of our nation 's most misunderstood founders 'the rights of man , ' contrary to public misunderstanding \( usually by those who have not read it in it 's entirety \) , bears out that paine in fact did believe in a divine entity , quoted directly from the bible throughout the essay , and had a near encyclopedic understanding of the new testament his criticisms were of organized religion and how men had used it to corrupt the very idea of an afterlife and the ideas of faith the publication of common sense , most forget , was one of the most important causes of the american revolution often derided even in his own time , paine reminds us that those who speak ideas that cause painful debate are at the heart of our nation 's ideals
thomas paine 's clear and concise writings make him one of the greatest political authors of his time basic thoughts of freedom and democracy , that seem so common place nowadays , were brought about because of paines radical ideas his books common sense and the rights of man were written not just for the political philosopher but also for the common man both the aforementioned books played a big part in the american and french revolutions
sports economics fascinates me , and mlb economics is especially fascinating the most powerful trade union in the world for the past two decades as been the mlpa , and this book explains why after getting my initial wake up call about the stupidity of baseball 's ownership through bouton 's ball four lo those many years ago , lords merely cements my opinion a more venal , greedy group would be hard to find in any other industry big on detail , impecably researched and tightly written , this is a must read for all baseball fans , especially for those of you in a city which is being brow beaten into building a stadium with public funds
this book does a superb job describing the business of baseball author john helyar gives readers a strong historical perspective , explaining how and why the game got to be the way it is today \( well , as of 1994 \) the author devotes considerable attention to labor issues we learn about the days of reserve clause slavery , the success of union chief marvin miller at winning gains for the players , and of owner attempts to cheat the players via collusion readers see that the game 's overseers \( team owners \) are often driven by greed and desire for power we also see why disparate , unshared local broadcast revenues give advantages to teams in large markets \( new york , los angeles , etc \) and make it tough for small market teams like kansas city and milwaukee to compete the author also refutes that repeated owner lament that they are losing money yes , a few teams \( montreal expos \) have bad years financially , but if most teams lost money and they do n't then player paychecks would bounce , the price of franchises would stop rising , and owners would stop holding bidding wars for top free agents

i would add to my strong recommendation of this book a companion reading of marvin miller 's a whole different ball game , which gives a better treatment of the early history of labor relations in the sport , but unfortunately ends in the mid 80 's , when miller 's retirement took effect i used to think the players were a bunch of greedheads once you know the history of the relations between owners and players , though , it 's easy to understand where they 're coming from
how the individual owners in major league baseball on a continual basis constantly lose out to the mlb players union in the collective bargaining process this book lucidly details how the owners plans are constantly frustrated by the union and also the commisioner of baseball who is the employee of the owners , but until recently had independent powers this book does not cover the bud selig years as commisioner of baseball a must read for the baseball fan who gets frustrated with the work stopages another must read book is marvin millers' whole different ball game a history how the union taught the players to be discontented about their salaries and the terms of employment how one man worked tirelessly to make athletes well informed about the business side of baseball and the lies of the owners , in so doing improved the lives of all profesional athletes
if you want to know about baseball , this is the one book you must read from the early days of robber baron owners , to the formation of the most powerful union in the world , this book tells it all in great detail i cannot recommend it enough to fans of the game as well as anyone interested in the history of business in america it has been said that to know the history of america , you must know the history of baseball this book exemplifies that thought its out of print , but try as hard as you can to find a copy you will not be dissapointed
awesome ! although it 's been more than five years since i read it , i always see it on my bookshelf and ask myself if i should read it again it was one of those books , especially for baseball fans like myself , that i never wanted to end
as with barbarians at the gate , helyar makes what could be a boring topic into an enlightening read a walk through baseball 's past from a business perspective , looking at the issues that shaped the game we watch today if you 're a true baseball fan , check out this book
readers interested in benny morris should read israeli historian yehoshua porath 's war and remembrance in the summer 2002 issue of azure porath adds to the oct 1995 and april 1990 discussions by robert satloff and shabtai teveth in middle eastern studies and to efraim karsh 's excellent book , fabricating israeli history do n't read this book without looking at these critiques
what makes this and other similar works by israel 's new historians significant is that they are coming around to what academics in europe and some even in america have known for decades , that israel forced the majority of palestinians out of israel through the use of terrorism , mass murder , and forced expulsions morris has joined the growing number of israelis and jewish americans who are coming out and looking at israel 's past without rose colored glasses and this is , of course , angering israel 's supporters who hold to such laughable notions that the arabs left of their own accord or were instructed to leave by other arab leaders for some reason that remains mysterious one might as well claim that the native americans moved to reservations because they wanted a change of scenery the criticism aimed at this book is part of the usual obfuscation process to make it seem as if there are two truths or that morris and the multitude of israeli historians like him are all prone to hyperbole this is nonsensical to say the least neutral academics who are n't involved in this conflict and israeli jews such as morris receive nothing but constant criticism for revealing the truth about this conflict to wider audiences in israel and america \( the europeans and others in the world do n't require new or revisionist history as they have been aware of the palestinian refugee problem and what caused it since it happened \) the declassified information found in israeli official archives is nothing new to much of the world , but it does help those people who know very little about this conflict or have the wrong idea in israel and the us many of the critics who have attempted to pan benny morris' work are the same academics who support such charlatans as joan peters they do n't want people to learn the obvious truth and see past the propoganda this is especially important here in the united states where pro israeli sentiments run high and blind support for that apartheid regime is unwavering also , the critics do n't note some of the interesting insights morris gives such as pointing to some israeli actions as purely military and not meant to drive out palestinians \( and thus supporting pro israeli views \) , but they still had that effect anyway morris does n't protray the zionists as some evil army , just a well organized one that planned for and carried out an expansionist campaign designed to disenfranchise the palestinians of their lands the war was fought weeks before an arab armies even announced their intentions to attack israel and yet strangely all the fighting took place in palestinian designated regions we also get some interesting insights into the major players like david ben gurion who was one of the master planners of the zionist plot to conquer palestine morris , contrary to what some reviewers claim , is actually quite balanced and neutral and is n't as harsh towards the israeli side as purported \( he 's actually a zionist himself \) morris is just not interested in living in some fantasyland that has been built up largely in israel and the united states that the arabs were all rabid anti jewish masses waiting to attack the jews and that the fledgling zionists did what they had to do to survive it was not survival which they sought , it was conquest and expansion and even many israeli academics have arrived at what has been obvious to the rest of the world highly recommended
this is the most important book ever authored about the palestinian refugees problem written by the famous israeli historian benny morris it is full of details based on declassified israeli , hanagah , and zionist documents the book is must read for any person who wants to know the core facts surrounding the plight of the ethnically cleansed palestinians
an excellent book that documents the origin of the palestinian refugee problem using israeli sources well researched and written , it is hard to debate moriss 's conclusions
this book has been replaced with better , more accurate information , free of the far left wing slant of morris i suggest prof uri dan 's excellent four volume set 'israel 's war of independence' which is far more detailed and accurate than this book
wow i wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of no stars o'reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it fiction is clearly not his strong suit his characters were cardboard cutouts , his dialogue stilted and ludicris , his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes , and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy 's mind really is if this trash is any indication of o'reilly 's true worldview , he 's a sick , sad man indeed
i'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored i am no fan of bill o'reilly and this novel is not the greatest , but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions especially if , from the looks of some of these reviews , a reviewer have not actually read this book
i have to say i really enjoyed this book no it 's not hemingway but it is fast moving and held my interest from the first page for a first time novelist , i give it two thumbs up i have certainly read worse by more established authors
wow , before i read this book i looked up the reviews listed at this site there are some very nasty \( and disingenuious \) reviews that have been posted by those who obviously oppose anything that mr o'reilly does , writes , or says
i'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews did n't actually stoop so low as to buy the book i read a few pages of it , and this is truly 7th 8th grade level writing
bill o'reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from twilight zone his vision reminds me of manhunter the michael mann film not the lame book he based it on o'reilly , tall and deformed , is the tooth fairy o'reilly is gutter trash
bill o'reilly ought to stick to what he does best , i e making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon
i 've heard this book on tape , which , poor writing aside , is more horrifying to actually hear o'reilly read in his own voice the gratuitous sex \( which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels \) is enough to turn anyone off , but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure a sad , sad example of narcissism at it 's very worst
this insight into tv journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent 's vacation to florida o'reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction \( or a work of anything , for that matter \)
this book might be a lot more helpful if it were updated regularly the current third edition is from 1986 , which is ludicrous with subject matter this volatile the content itself is a bit too brief , but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last 1 5 years
this book was not enlighting , alot of the information was out date the phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc
this book has an excellent collection of recipes even if you 're not vegan it 's much better than other vegetarian vegan recipe books i 've tried
unbelievably great cookbook every receipt that i have tried , i love easy to understand , easy ingredients , and very fresh approach flavor , freshness , delicious i cannot say enough good about this book
though we are n't vegans , we do enjoy vegetarian vegan cuisine and have almost worn our copy of this cookbook out the recipes taste great , are clearly explained , and do n't require a lot of specialty \( hard to find \) ingredients the conversion index in the back , for metric us measurements and temperatures is also very helpful
the mediterranean vegan kitchen cookbook makes healthy cooking taste heavenly i especially enjoy recipes that do not use cheese and still deliver optimum flavor the book is well organized and the recipes are easy to follow if you are serious about getting or staying healthy , this one is a must have

arrived in great condition i read this years ago and am now enjoying the escapade again
twenty years ago the sudden appearance of a nervous looking young security guard at the door of my office nearly gave me a heart attack it was three in the morning , the hospital 's ninth floor \( the non patient biophysics department \) was otherwise completely dark and empty , and i 'd been laughing so hard that i had n't heard the security guard walk up to my door when i looked up and saw him , the shock was like a cattle prod to the solar plexus the guard also looked sort of scared when he 'd gotten off the elevator on what was supposed to be an empty floor , he 'd heard hysterical cackling coming down a dark corridor and was torn between duty and just getting back on the elevator and pretending to have heard nothing
reading the other reviews , i feel as if i'm going to be sent to the devil for not bowing down before it but let 's not suspend all our \( god given \? \) critical faculties before what is , i agree , a magical , unique book this sort of literary sycophancy is just the sort of thing bulgakov skewers herein
before writing a book review , i always attempt to determine what the intent of the author was and how successfully the desired effect was achieved so what , exactly , is the purpose of bulgakov 's the master and margarita \?
first , let me deliver the highest possible praise this novel deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as ulysses , tristram shandy , candide , gulliver 's travels , the trial and the metamorphosis it is not merely one of the greatest comic satirical novels ever written it is also one of the most imaginative books ever written and i mean ever , as in 'since the invention of writing '
this masterpiece has gained almost supernatural halo in russia
are you tired of russian novels where people are slaves to horrible jobs and then die terrible depressing deaths \? mikhail bulgakov 's masterpiece is unlike anything else you 'll ever read it 's a story of theology , government , fantasy , and love
pretentious and boring , too clever for its own good , the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ , and there 's not enough of that
this book is a must read for anyone interested in expanding their awareness in life i am russian , so read this book in its original language and just for kicks in english this translation by richard pevear is pretty bad , as well as the one by mirra ginsberg this one is choppy and not well written , and the one by mirra just does n't do the original work justice it 's not poetic at all the best translation is with the red and black cover with a profile of a cat
while there are plenty of business books available by armchair ceos , what made gary 's book stand out is his experience when michael jordan talks about basketball people listen and when gary talks about business people listen here 's why

as usual , douglas preston and lincoln child confirm their great ability in writing cool , well conceived page turners
the alternate title of this book should have been how to affect an air of sophistication and urbanity in several hundred pages of plodding and frankly unbelievable plotting coupled with two dimensional stereotypes so predictable in their pretentious musings
book of the dead is a perfect ending to a great triolgy of books , the started with brimstone and dance of death i highly recommend reading those before starting this one , each book basically continues from where the previous one left off in a cliffhanger fashion the book of the dead continues with pendergast battling his evil brother diogenes , and it continues to be compelling dance of death was probably more exciting than this book , but i found this book to just be more interesting it reveals alot about the characters , and you learn more about a certain girl who is shrouded in mystery she plays a pivotal role in this book , and it ends in a bang you honestly ca n't go wrong with these books , they once again show why they are the masters of mystery
the final chapter to the war between brothers , a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax i expected a more elaborate ending after such a build up during the three novels but nevertheless a good ending to the series
i 've read every pendergast book , and still life with crows is by far my favorite so i tend to measure each book by still life this book , while a lot better than the previous dance of death , still does n't eclipse still life however , it 's good for what it is a fairly predictable and formulaic pendergast novel but what 's wrong with that \? the formula is fun , pendergast is an intriguing and neat character , and the expanding role of constance green is well worth a return trip to whatever pendergast novel comes next
very clever premiss , caused me to look into the actual books of the dead which are simplistic yet provided the entire faith system for an ancient culture that dominates the world today the mystery was fun to read and there were a few nice twists but as in the davinci code , the historical fiction far surpassed the story telling
after stumbling over a weak and silly plot in brimstone , the authors recovered nicely in dance of death , and now has brought the trilogy home to an almost flawless conclusion in book of the dead from the moment pendergast busted out of herkmoor prison , this fantastic and horrifying tale held me enthralled the book features wild action , the gotta love him journalist smithback , interesting tidbits involving egyptology , some laugh out loud scenes , and plenty of fun technical information \( dynamite , anyone \? \) i could not put this book down and read it over two days \( sorry , honey , the dishes are n't done and nothing 's cooking on the stove \) note this novel is not stand alone start with cabinet of curiosities , brimstone , and dance of death book of the dead is definitely my favorite in the pendergast series
the other reviewers will tell you about the book i 've read most of preston and child 's works , including the other two books in this trilogy , and they are a good read what gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism i guess it 's a necessity to get published today , but you 'd think that at least some male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published i guess most people will sell their souls for money just about all the men in p and l 's books are either wimps , effiminate , weak , bumbling , stupid \( or liars or murderers \) , cry babies , scared of their own shadows , and thoroughly unlikable \( even pendergast has his moments \) the women , of course , are , without exception , tough , brilliant , shrewd , fearless , always right , on the rise to the top , always outsmarting the men , able to knock out a 7 foot , 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck \( forgive the slight hyperbole \) , totally unfeminine , and just as unlikeable as the men the stories are very good it 's unfortunate preston and child could n't have come up with better , more realisticly human , less insulting characters this slop may play in new york and california , but in texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women
preston and childs have ended this trilogy with a great high adventure read agent pendergast is a most intriguing central character as are the supporting cast members the ending leaves one to believe that there could be yet another novel \? \? \? \?
this is a book that all students of the american revolution should be forced to read without understanding bailyn 's argument , that the conspiracy against liberty was the main reason why america decided to break away from the british empire , a student will be forever lost in trying to understand the roots of the american revolution almost all of the books on the outbreak of the american revolution have had to take bailyn 's argument into consideration so , if you 're interested in the study of the american revolution , then this book is an imperative read read t h breen 's the marketplace of revolution after this book , and you 'll have a decent grasp of the roots of the american revolution
while the 17th century witnessed the failure of the libertarian levellor revolution , the 18th century can be said to embody its partial victory in the form of the american revolution the radical libertarian nature of the yankee revolutionaires has only recently been acknowledged by historians bailyn 's volume broke new ground when it was published in 1967 by showing the radical whig foundations of the american revolution he says attitudes and ideas that would constitute the revolutionary ideology was present a half century before there was an actual revolution
as of today , the work bailyn did in this book is not new but if considered in the context of the time period when he wrote it and what it did for the study of the american revolution , this book was the beginning of the current dominate thought on the revolution bailyn changed the way historians and americans look at the revolution by challenging the work of several scholars written extremely well , this book deserves every award it revceiced and is still entitled to be a mainstay in history departments around the country
bernard bailyn 's the ideological origins of the american revolution is a truly masterful work bailyn gets to the heart of the radicalism of the american revolution a deep suspicion of government power , particularly centralizing power
long before there were bloggers and political pundits there were the pamphleteers bernard bailyn shows just how important pamphleteering was in getting the message out take tom paine 's common sense for instance more than 200 , 000 copies were distributed throughout the colonies , making it a runaway bestseller in its day he championed universal suffrage , the unicameral legislature and a clean break from england he was countered by john adams , who , in thoughts on government , felt a more prudent course was in order bailyn gleens from these famous pamphlets and many others and presenting a very compelling history of the american revolution it was a revolution in thought as well as government , that eventually saw adams' federalist ideas seize the upper hand but , pennsylvania initially adopted many of paine 's ideas , creating the only unicameral legislature in the united states , and extending voting rights to most men
when it comes to american history , it is arguably so that the most important dates or events , whivhever you prefer , is the american revolution the dates run from about 1764 , with the passage of the sugar act to 1783 the peace of paris was decided , or even as late as 1787 when delaware became the first state in the union however you look at it , there is no one text that gives you a better , more thorough telling and understanding of the most important time in out history , before we officially had a country to even have a history , than the ideological origins of the american revolution by bernard bailyn this is the most thorough and most balanced fusion of primary documents and secondary analysis every topic is important every conclusion is crucial to understanding the truth about this great and terrible period in our history it receives my highest recommendation
i did n't read this book for the truth , or the lie , but just to read it ! it was an amazing story , whether or not it 's true was irrevelant in my eyes james frey is an amazing author putting all the drama aside about everything that went on , i really and truly enjoyed this book
this book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if james frey did not repeat himself a million times
i think if you 've lived life under a rock , watched a lot of soap operas , and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas , this book will appeal to you
i 've done some investigating on this book and james frey as an author when he first started looking for a publisher to publish a million little pieces , we titled it as a non fiction work , and was turned down for years he finally put the title of biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher
this is a book written from the heart filled with deep soul searching and honesty i'm familiar with alcohol and drug addiction i'm familiar with treatment centers for those of you who know this road this book touches home for those of you who do n't do n't be the first to throw that proverbial 'stone' i 've heard the reports of the 'untruths' regarding this publication i read it anyway pain is an immense ocean the depth of that ocean is different for each of us this 'message' could be a gift for many a starting point , a different way of looking at life and it 's unkind lessons this book offers an open hand to start you on a journey towards reality toward clarity for those of you who belittled this book be it truth or sensationalism be cautious ! you never know what life holds for you or yours around the next bend the information offered here , the idea of taking that 'first step towards recovery' , the process of becoming honest with yourself and others , could well be the salvation for someone you love yep , it 's got some rough language did you really expect anything else from a drug addict \? common ! gimme' a break ! get real with yourself ! keep an open mind and dig into this book ! it 's a good read !
i have always wondered what happens in a treatment center how do people stop being an addict \? what do they do all day \? what kind of people are in a treatment center \? this book answers those questions and shows that there 's hope for every addict i think it 's an excellent read a gift to all addicts it 's exiting , i could n't put it down and i thought about it quit a lot
i 'd heard the buzz \( both pro and con \) and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book
it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read i read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about the writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read i ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over i know this is supposed to be for emphasis , but i just found it indulgent the lack of correct punctuation was distracting , too had i read this when the book first came out , before everyone knew he lied , i would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of aa although i have not attended aa or any similar support groups , i feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions , that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own , which in most cases i am sure they are not i found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than james frey , and i ca n't say that i felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself but i am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he is n't feeling so badly anymore
if you can get past the scandal that revolves around this book and actually read it , you will not be disappointed this is a must read for anyone who has been touched one way or another by a drug or alcohol addiction
my mother has introduced numerous authors to me , and i am glad that she has she has introduced to me to classics , to modern day litature , and some crud books i learned what to pick from her i know what to read when she introduced this book to me , i had no prior knowledge about the author , james frey for all i knew , it was a drug book after my mother had finished it , she gave it to me to read i was skeptical about it i felt that i could not read it , because it did n't sound intresting it was a story of a man that defines rock bottom he wakes up on a plane , covered in body fluids , and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it he is then taken to a rehababilitation facility , where he detoxs and thinks about life he then meets love and finds himself there it is a uplifting story
my publisher recommended this book as i prepared to write my second non fiction book i was looking for guidelines for proposal writing , and was not disappointed i found something helpful in each of the ten proposals the hermans chose to illustrate their guidelines the list of elements that need to be included in any proposal , no matter the genre , convinced me i 'd do well to follow their advice i recommend this book for new authors looking for help getting their foot in a publisher 's door
many unpublished authors have never seen a successful book proposal that landed a book contract in simple , straight forward language , jeff herman and deborah herman provide would be writers with ten different examples of book proposals which sold combined with their analysis of why they sold
i recommend this book to anyone who tells me they need help with a nonfiction proposal literally i ca n't think of a better resource on the market in terms of giving concrete examples and explaining what a proposal should accomplish , and how precisely it should be organized a must for anyone looking to nail down a nonfiction proposal
the book was recommended to me by a literary agent and after reading through it and using it as an example i can understand why it 's just an excellent book proposal reference
for a slim volume , this book packs a punch is its limited number of pages if you prefer seeing actual examples as opposed to just reading how to , then pick this up i used it to guide me as i wrote the proposal for my 1st book within 14 days of sending out my proposals , i had a contract
i added this book to my writing reference section because i know i will be referring back to it again
i just reread this edition of this wonderful book and came away even more impressed than the first time
dry and running with scissors were incredible possible side effects is also a great read , only it 's slightly less edgy and slightly less consistent than the other two were \? maybe less editing \? but if you liked dry and running you will like possible
beware ! possible side effects is a witty glimpse into the mind of augustin burroughs he 's funny , neurotic and very articulate you 'll enjoy getting to know one of the most imaginative and talented writers to present himself to the public you 're going to love this ! !
the thing about augusten burroughs is this he can take a mundane situation \( like chipping his tooth while eating a bowl of soup \) and turn it into a hilarious retelling his use of similes and metaphors is often hilarious and , in general , he just has a hold on the english language
ok , so i was literally almost sobbing as i read this book because i was laughing so damn hard augustun burroughs appears to let his id run around outside his body and the results are freaking hilarious !
out of fairness , i should tell you that i did n't listen to the whole audiobook i got about 1 2 way though the first cd and just could n't stand it anymore what i heard was boring and extremely slow moving it 's read like a see spot run story for children , which makes the boring storyline even more boring and i found it to be a bit insulting i think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting maybe it gets better as it goes along , but i am not willing to endure any more to find out
i really enjoyed this latest memoir of mr burroughs , almost as much as his first rws , dry and mt my favorites were his essays on cow bentley , his french bulldogs , julia 's child , and the essay on his paternal grandmother there were a few that seemed like he might be reaching for things to remember to fill out the book , but overall it was with much enjoyment that i read his latest
it takes a lot for a book to make me laugh out loud not only did this one make me snort , it also squeezed my gut made me want to cry
i remember when i first got into spirituality and metaphysics , i was so naive about certain things i really thought that once a person begins to practice their true self their inner spirit when they remember that they were a soul with a body and not a body with a soul than they were automatically free from all things human they were impervious to any thing from the sniffles to cancer to death but the thing is , that no matter how advanced we are on the spiritual path , and i use that word with some hesitation , because there is no advancing on the spiritual path , we are already as spiritual as we are ever going to be , the bottom line is that we are still in the world of form this is where the words of jesus ring so clear , be in the world , but not of it in other words , remember that no matter what may be going on in your world , you are still a spiritual being no matter what !
could anyone other than ram dass bring such a light hearted , unattached , almost whimsical approach to the subject of aging and the accompanying physical problems that go with it as we journey towards death ram dass shares his personal journey of aging with us just as he has everything else in his life for almost half a century now though his body has changed with time he still maintains that infectious smile , those bright , mischevious eyes and a beguiling wit and wisdom that has so endeared him to a generation of seekers who still look to him not so much for answers , but to posit the questions we cannot quite grasp ourselves
this is a book on the yoga of aging consciously in 1997 ram dass experienced a stroke that left him with expressive aphasia and partial paralysis he has learned the hard way that aging can be unkind to the body , but in every situation dass seeks the opportunity for spiritual growth he teaches us how to diminish our suffering despite the aches , pains , and limitations that come to us with age by stepping away from the ego self to embrace the soul self , where we can witness our thoughts and emotions and evaluate their effects on us no one gets out of life alive read this book and enjoy the journey
i loved this book ram dass has been a pioneer in so many areas , and now he 's leading the parade of aging baby boomers into a whole new territory i admire his courage , his humor , and his boundless spirit this book is simply written , yet the message is profound it was just what i needed to hear at this time of my life
this is one of those books you end up buying copies for your friends it deals with something we are all going to have to face the transition from this life to the next one i really love this book thank you mr dass
here is a book continuing the path of help and service to others , except this time ram dass , from a stroke , has more personal experience in the receiving end of helpful service , which makes his book that much more meaningful
when i picked up the book still here from a roadside bookstall at mg road , bangalore , i was attracted by the title and the face on the front cover that looked very western and yet carried a hindu name , ram dass the title raised certain questions in my mind why still here \? where was the author before \?
another epoch in our lives \( us baby boomers \) and ram dass is right there to point the way once more i ca n't say enough about how appropriate this book is for anyone getting on in years that wants a proper approach towards aging with happiness and a spiritual focus

having lived 60 of my life outside the usa in various countries , i 've often been surprised at how unhappy many americans appear to be in the poor countries where i 've lived \( third world \) , people generally seem happier , friendlier , more willing to share give and less stressed even though they have much less \( material goods , that is \) those of you who have travelled , that is , actually gotten off the beaten path , the megaresorts , the disneyfied locations , to places like the phillipines , colombia , honduras , mexico , guatemala , peru , etc , have probably noted the difference
the authors of this book are concerned americans are n't doing what they should specifically , to paraphrase former president bill clinton , they 're not spending their money right they value things they should n't they work too much they own too much they shop at evil big box stores like wal mart so , with paternalistic concern in their hearts , they have written this book to warn us that we 're in need of a correction
basically an interesting , revealing if not alarming book , with loads of data , some striking graphs , and several silly cartoons the authors have a bullet point approach to the topic , with short chapters \( 30 chapters in 247 pages \) and multiple headings within each chapter the data themselves are quite compelling , even if the writing style is not
i was very much looking forward to recieving this title from amazon com after reading the first few pages online and , admittedly , i did like the first few chapters however , the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly , and became almost smug and self aggrandizing the authors seemed far too pleased with themselves , and , by approximately the halfway point i felt as if i were reading some kind of bizzare conservationist manifesto i like to think as a self appointed conservationist and vegan that i try to mind mother nature and all living creatures , but after i finished reading this repetitive , pedantic bore , i lost the will to care maybe i am being too harsh , but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter then , it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant others liked the book , and that 's fine but i was disappointed
ok i loved the book and agreed with the basic premise that americans sure need to take a good look at their lifestyles the whole materialistic overconsumption thing is really disgusting once you recognize it i have read several books with this similar theme \( kalle laasen , naomi klein , travels of a t shirt in a global society , etc \) and the more i read the more stuff i eliminate from my life i do not think that all the kids are as bad as some of those out there think and not everyone is so pathetic and greedy as the book points out it is just better imagery to paint a portrait of an america that has lost itself in a self centered materialistic mire i have 4 kids who do not get everything they want they do chores they learn to behave and show respect and they work hard i know so many parents just like me and there are many very close neighbors in my neighborhood and others in my town there are block parties , people help eachother out \( not only after disasters either \) and life goes on no we do not live in some imaginary eutopia we live 0n the east coast we work jobs and save money for our childrens college etc i say all this because although i agree with the book that american culture as a whole is going down the tubes , i think there are many people who are living in america that are resisting this cultural downfall i do wish that this book could be required reading in schools ! ! ! sometimes it is difficult to get my teenagers to understand my rantings ! ! it is worth the effort and if each of my kids and all those other great kids out there can recongnize the games advertisers play and can resist the temptations toward overconsumption that is pushed on them then they will lead us into a fine future lets encourage the counter materialistic culture and pass the reading along ! !
i agree wholeheartedly with the excess and the overconsumption that is the main theme of this book i also agree with the lack of free time and the toll that working longer is having on our mental and physical health i am sick of the suburban sprawl around me and the rapid rate that every piece of green open space is getting concreted over overconsumption is killing us
this book is a fantastic collection of the effects and symptoms of greed and materialism it fails to address why these elements exist in the first place , it fails to address how the liberal ideology of the left in america are hypocrites by promoting this rampant materialism , and hypocritically denouncing it
every once in awhile , you come across a book that manages to strike a core and stick with you long after you 're finished reading it it really made me stop and think at how wasteful and materialistic my own life and habits have become i do n't entirely blame myself however , for i am simply another victim of this plague , a sickness that has completely taken over america and is far worse than the flu or common cold
i purchased this book when i unexpectedly had a new german shorthair puppy to train i purchased it because it had an extensive section on puppy training and i was anxious to get started i also soon purchased several other bird dog training books , including some very famous ones , but i kept coming back to larry muellers book i like his attitude toward dogs and his willingness to go against commonly held beliefs and techniques he is a very obsevant man who incorporates the latest dog psychology into his obsevations the emphasis is on avoiding mistakes or techniques which cause setbacks and cost you time to correct this gives you a lot of insight into dogs minds and training in general most importantly every technique he recommended worked ! i cannot say that about any of the other books also every thing that he said to avoid that i did not manage to avoid cost me time he was right i have repeatedly received compliments on my dogs performance and manners even by pros the biggest factor in that was this book this is an excellent book to purchase before acquiring a pup his puppy training section \( 2 4months old \) is extensive , excellent and effective he also has techniques for selecting a pup which make a lot of sense
larry mueller offers his unique way of speed training a bird dog , however , i do feel that his techniques are stressing to a dog especially a sensitive dog or a young dog \( say six months \) larry does offer some excellent ways to train your dog on the basic obedience hunting commands , but his use of force training goes beyond my personal preference if you are a first time trainer , training your own dog , this book is excellent if you approach training with love and patience remember , you are training a friend and companion , not a strickly business hunting dog
i spent the entire summer of 2006 starting in about may thru till november reading the left behind series in its entirety from the rapture book onwards \( i already read the rising and regime previously \)
i have listened to \( and enjoyed \) many books on cd in the past few years this reader is among the worst that i 've had the displeasure of hearing the content of this book is great , so do n't get me wrong however , the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended he pronounces many character names incorrectly , including carpathia and adbullah his character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and or annoying \( especially carpathia 's \) his voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue he also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason these are just the most obvious and annoying problems there are too many to list completely here , so please trust me and avoid listening to this book
i dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap opera like compulsion , always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our lord therefore , i anticipated this final novel to be glorious , as the title indicates , but i was woefully wrong are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming king and his kingdom \? certainly not !
i truely enjoyed reading the series and actually hate to have reached the end i am blessed to see the reviews of other christians who enjoyed the series as much as i did this book was straight from the bible and painted a picture in my mind of what the glorious appearing could be like i think rayford should have spent more time with kenny rather than he being put off on others especially after his job was done i also wish there would have been more to the reunions at the end , it focused on rayfords family but i think there would have been more to it that what is written overall i love this series and hope they do make more movies based on the books god bless
i must admit i was surprised by how many people gave this book bad reviews this book offers a biblical account of the return of christ based on what we know from the bible , especially from the book of revelation i was more surprised for the reasons that were used to justify those bad ratings since so many others have used this page to support their views , i have decided to do the same
my kids started reading the left behind kids books , and because i was concerned about the message and theology of the books , i started reading them also then i decided to check out the adult books from the library
the book arrived within the promised time frame would certainly buy from amazon again
although fiction , this book , as well as others in this series , follows the predictions in the bible it is a very feasible scenario of what is to come i greatly enjoyed reading the whole series i am an avid reader , reading up to eight hours a day when i start a good book i can rarely put it down before finishing it i certainly recommend this whole series to everyone , religious or not ! you just might learn something
tim lahaye , jerry jenkins , and others in the pre trib circle , such as ed hindson , tommy ice , chuck missler , etc , continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early church , and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived \? tim cohen , in his excellent book , the antichrist and a cup of tea , provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that , the same author \( tim cohen \) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture \( based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah , history , and the tribulation period series \( see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items \)
did not like , thought stories were full of idealistic nonsense unrealistic options for the family farmer
as a fan of barbara kingsolver 's nonfiction i recommend the book 's foreword , in particular , for a personal and incisive statement of the agrarian ethic and its relevance for this time editor norman wirzba 's counsel that we cannot live well if we do not attend to the human and non human bonds of relationship is also of deep import in an age of mindless surfeit masquerading as self realization
i own the book as well as the set of cds and have listened to and read over again i ca n't say enough good about the content and i 've read lots of trading books you 'll get more than your money 's worth on the psychology of trading , money management and trading tactics definitely a keeper
if you read and follow the principles in this book you will make enough money on your trades to pay for this book many times over i have been active in the market for years \( averaging 20 return a year \) and i agree with this author completely having lived out the greed , fear , and mistakes he talks about read this book and save yourself a lot of unnecessary losses
this book is a gem amongst average books i 've read about 100 technical analysis books and i 've gone back and re read this one 6 times very important
the info in this book stays current it 's the art of war of tradin
if your are going to buy a single book on trading , this is it go ahead and buy it ! this is a scolarly book that explains the complex workings of successful trading in simple and clear terms do n't hessitate and get it it is worth i
this book changed my life and changed the way i trade part of the reason i can say that is the fact that i developed my all time most reliable and profitable trade from elder 's simple explanations fully 80 of my trades are based on a formation that occurs using two indicators described in this book elder even identifies the formation as being the strongest signal in technical analysis i will certainly agree , though it took me some time to find the ideal market and time frame for it if you trade futures , stocks , or currencies with candlesticks , the secret is in this book it gave me the edge i needed to become consistently profitable i own more than 60 trading related books \( those are just the keepers \) and i think what makes elder stand out is the fact that he is was a successful trader for many years and that the content of this book is the hard won wisdom of those years this is not a book written by some infomercial peddler who makes his living selling trading courses i chuckle when i see the price for this book is 47 25 because i would have counted it a steal at a hundred times that to unlock the strategies in trading for a living you will have to adapt them to your own trading style , vehicle , and funds i agree with another reviewer who said this book is for a person who is more than an amateur but not yet a pro i believe that the techniques used by most very sophisticated professional traders are built on the indicators and principles found in this book
i bought the book nine years ago , and it still is after reading several other books , elder is my personal number one as this is the only book who dives into the personal mind dr alexander elder , has a psychiatric background what makes him extremely powerful in explaining what is actually happening with the mind and with the masses who are trading it gave me as a novice a deep and thorough understanding of what makes the market move he also gave me as a starting trader excellent idea 's and rules on money management which is absolutely crucial i personally have this book on my number 1 for people who want to learn trading and get a deeper understanding of their own behavior and possible dangers beside that lots of practical tips and strategies are given the book is an excellent book for the beginner and the advanced trader who needs to review his own behavior
i just finished the book and plan to read it again from cover to cover it will definitely pay for itself and is one of the best trading books i 've read it is also well written and offers some good ideas on money management as well
after suffering a loss due to 'unreasonable exuberance' in 1997 , i was about to quit market i borrowed this book from library and from the very first page i felt as if mr elder had written my trading biography this book was a retrospect on my trading psychology habit and realized my wrong approach to market i read this book couple of time so that i fully register mr elder 's teaching and started trading again it has been 9 years , i read this book , once every year just to make sure i do not deviate from my trading discipline every trader once in his trading life must read this book
so basically everyone reads the two magician books and thinks whoa , that was a great series but they do n't even suspect that the next two books could have anything to do with books 1 2 wrong in fact , they have so much to do with the books that that in book 4 the real riftwar ends but this book sets up for book one this , in my opinion is the worst riftwar book but since i loved it , how much do you think i liked the others
that is exactly what this book is a great book it 's absolutely amazing it takes the story a little while to get going , but that 's only a little while , and after that it 's great , active , and enjoyable
silverthorn is the 'second' book in the riftwar trilogy \( i say second because it can be considered the third since magician is broken into two books \) this book is more a segway into the third not much happens in the way of plot for the trilogy until near the end , but when it does it does it well
silverthorn by raymond feist in the 3rd \( or 2nd depending on how you read magician \) book in the riftwar saga with this installment feist picks up where he left off the best thing about books like this is the author does n't need to invest as much time and energy setting up the players , as we already know who they are and what they stand for
silverthorn picks up feist 's riftwar storyline several years after the end of the tsuranni mikemia war detailed in his previous two books
i hated this book there was no point to it cept to waste pages and time reading it this took me the longest to read and actully like i never got instrested in the book and there no premise to it that made me wanna read more of it its about arutha the new prince of korndor having to save his princess to me thats all you need to know i would really not say to read this book , but skip to a darkness at sethanon
continuing the story that started with magician apprentice and magician master the riftwar saga is n't just about a war between two worlds anymore previous enemies have a truce and a peace but a new enemy emerges the moredhel army , nighthawks , and their prophecied leader heralds the return of an ancient race this book drew me in even deeper into the world of midkemia and have influenced my interest in fantasy literature very highly recommended
this is the 3rd book in this most excellent series first of all i would like to say that this book splits it 's time between following prince arutha on his quest for silverhorn and pug and his search for answers about the danger they face as with the other books in the series the story grips you and the action is plenty i would say that arutha 's quest for silverthorn is almost like a side quest in terms of the whole plot it does help to introduce new aspects of the plot and it also has young jimmy the hand in the spotlight i like how his character is developing i also hope that his relationship with the upright man is further explored in later books the one main gripe i have is how easy this books' main bad guy was dispatched you are made to believe that he is much more powerfull then he turns out to be everything is always wrapped up in a neat package at the end would not be so bad to see a good guy get his head kicked in \( lyam \? \? \? \? \) from time to time having said that i ordered the 4th book in the series within hours of finishing this
near the level of magician apprentice and magician master , now those were awesome
for those who already know the various authors of this book individually , words will be in excess to describe the treasures contained therein the five spanish already classical authors and jorge luis borges closing the group with honors are a guarantee of high quality and deep touching entertainment tasting the fluent and sincere social verb of quevedo , or absorbing in silence the sweet and perfect mysticism of juana ins would be sufficient to recommend this book but we find much more , machado , garca lorca and miguel hernndez , marked by the horrors of the spanish civil war , found in their sensibility , the way to transform hate and blood into the purest and most powerful poetry about borges , well , what can one say about a man of his talents , his well known depth is something you will find easily linked to his enormous sensibility and human solidarity definitively , this multiple anthology is a treasure to keep forever
i am a big fan of noam chomsky , and if you like to read a short book about 9 11 and the lies and deceptions attached to this tragic event , i highly recommend this book
i thought this book was a good read i do n't totally agree with all of chomsky 's views , but getting an semi alternative view was good i think he does press a little too much by accusing the us and israel of being terrorist we \( the us \) did n't specifically target civilians by hitting the towers , but i think the book sheds light on that we were involved in activities that killed many innocent people , not that we wanted people dead but to maintain control i ca n't agree that with chomsky that we should n't have played a role in afghanistan during the 80 's it was a good way to indirectly hurt the soviet union but our previous administrations foreign policies failed to protect us with what happened on 9 11 if something remotely similiar happens again , then the bush administration has failed the book is good to read if you are open minded and not biased against or for the us , israel , or who ever chomsky makes the us look bad so if you the american thats refuses to accept our wrongdoing do n't read it if you are anti bush and whatever , reading it might fuel your bias if you are more moderate then its a great book to give you some things to think about but do n't take everything to seriously but seriously do n't outright deny any possiblities
the religion of peace is at it again ! in response to the popes words , muslims all over the world respond with violence , destruction , rage , hatred , burning down buildings , burning papal effigies , issuing fatwas against the pope , and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back wow , such peace from a religion of peace if islam is a religion of peace , then all the guns in the world are pink flowers , and every nuclear bomb , a soft feathery pillow violence for words destruction for speech please ! this is a religion of war , and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america
i picture chomsky in a sunless , cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers , surrounded only by walls of his own clippings yes , his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world not everything is a conspiracy theory , and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture the world is too random for all similar events to be related but when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts , the result is going to be nonsense i respect chomsky 's right to say what he thinks , and as a liberal i often find myself agreeing with him \( but for vastly different reasons \) what i do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel , when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems to me , he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9 11 was perpetrated by the u s government
this is a spiteful , hateful man who is out of his element outside of linguistics and he got that wrong , as well
noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his , yours , and mine the united states of america he has made millions of dollars teaching , lecturing , selling his books , and investing his world wide fame in psycholinguistics is well deserved his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u s , in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism , when he always ranks the u s and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now , and even in history his distrust of any authority , benign or otherwise , is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog , even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah
this is excellent material from chomsky inspired me to reread some of his earlier works and to purchase 2 i had n't read this is clear , concise , if somewhat repetitive \( but it tells you it will be , so that 's all right too \) gives a different view of the cause and effects of 9 11 , a must read for anyone wanting a well rounded view of that time
chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist , is he begins with a typical theory america is bad and all that it does is bad , finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together , and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme despite chomsky 's belief that bin laden 's attacks were driven by us foreign policy , all one has to do is go to the source , whom chomsky believes can be taken at his word , to realize the goals of bin laden
this is book is collection of interviews by noam chomsky given before and after the attacks on the wtc
i havent get the book yet \? \? \? \? back order it is been like almost 2 months
tom hopkins has set a standard to which all others must aspire this book is the epitome of good selling techniques and the lost art of just down right communicating in a language all interested parties can understand
this book is primarily a book on the art of selling , which you probably already guessed from the title it is also much more than that
a must read for those who are starting out in selling saves you a hell of alot of time !
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
classy cover , over 100 pages more than the previous edition new and revised easy to see why this book is the 1 best selling booko n sales of all time and what tom hopkins is the 1 best sales trainer in the entire world !
this is by far the greatest book of all time not just on selling , but on almost everything that life can throw your way i trust tom hopkins and everything he says is very real to me because he tells it , and tells it perfectly he is certainly a true champion i will reccomend this book to anyone who ever wants to achieve anything in life , and wants the money , security , and recognition that goes with it this is the least expencive most valuable tool you could possibly get tom hopkins is brilliant and every sentance of this book reflects that perfectly if your fed up with being less than you know you can be , get this book !
that old cliche has never been more true than today and that is very apparent by the review supposedly written by lisa m malki who claims to have 30 years of sales experience and refers to these techniques as old school sales junk , manipulative and closing questions that are designed to arm wrestle me into buying
over the 25 years of my sales career , i have purchased many copies of 'how to master the art of selling' some i have given away , others literally fell apart from constant rereading , highlighting and so on
this book masters the art of getting the clients to sell themselves to you by teaching you to ask the right questions the instructions and suggestions are given through a variety of sales conversations i highly recommend this book
monographs dealing with west 's rise from a backward feudal society to the most technologically advanced and wealthiest civilization this world has ever seen , seem to come a dime a dozen nowadays given the large amounts of books available on this topic , and the fact that it was published twenty years ago , what reasons are there for reading how the west grew rich \? quite a few i would argue
this book is good , has alot of games i plan on trying alot of them
as an acting teacher i was thrilled with this book it has lots of terrific improv games and ideas i'm inspired and i know my kids will be too
to start off , i am the author of the book so take the star review for what it is i just wanted to give you a little more depth to what this book is about in case you are looking at purchasing it first i will tell you that i 've had over 12 years experience of not only performing improv and owning a troupe , but i 've been very lucky to teach improv to people of all ages and walks of life i will be up front with my statement that no one person can teach you everything about improv i learned from many people and took what i liked to form my style and beliefs it is that style that is in my book and i encourage you to look at several books if you are really serious about it
this book is not for everyone if you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that \( such as long winded language that seems outdated to us today \) , then you should stay away
note to all first time readers this book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula i read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it journey to the center of the earth is also a classic , but i prefer this well written , with a unique story and good visuals throughout the reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the nautilus captain nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers in this one will see man vs man , and man vs nature for some the descriptions of various marine life may seem over done for me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made captain nemo tick mr verne 's book deserves the appelation , far ahead of its time
having chewed and digested around the world in eighty days , five weeks in a balloon and journey to the centre of the earth , i set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of verne the often overlooked true father of science fiction with much relish sure , 20 , 000 leagues seemed bigger than the others i 'd read , but i thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of verne all the way well , i was nearly right
20 , 000 leagues under the sea was a very complex book the authors word choice was what made it so complex , the author used words like vexed zoophytes and connoisseur the majority of these words were old english , which added to the complexity of the book the sentence structure was similar to the word choice , it was also very complex sentences , the sentences were usually not to long but not to short , at times they could be quite long though , and they were old an english style the book itself is about three human beings chasing after a giant narwhal as the author calls it these three characters are known as professor m arronax , a genius professor from france whose passion is to study , conseil , a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor , and ned land , a canadian harpooner conseil and the professor accept an invitation to the boat the abram lincoln , the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant cetacean , or a sea creature this creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds , and so the 3 meet up at the boat they pursue the creature for over a month , when they finally catch up with the lightning fast cetacean they pursue it , however when the creature strikes back ned land , conseil , and professor arronax are thrown into the ocean , and separated from their boat , they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean , to find out that it is not at all a sea monster , but an amazing submarine named the nautilus led by captain nemo they then learn of captain nemo 's plans , and embark on a submarine hunt on the bottom of the ocean , they discover atlantis , they venture to the south pole , and even fight among poulps or cuttlefish of enormous size , 20 , 000 leagues under the sea is full of adventure
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of literature and you should do n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one quarter of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher , and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel , pick up the elegant naval institute press edition , in a modern , complete , updated translation , with commentary by the leading american verne expert today , walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition \( no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint \) less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by jean michel margot , president najvs
i'm a bit surprised to be the first reviewer of this classic when i began my career in wildlife management over 30 years ago i was surprised at how many people quoted this work , but admitted they had not actually read it i had read it in graduate school and was amazed at how prescient leopold had been he accurately predicted where wildlife management would go in the future and what would be necessary for success \( as a side note , leopold used the two word term `wild life' meaning plants , animals , the soil i e ecosystems the term was changed to one word by the wisconsin legislature and defined as certain animals only \)
no one likes difficult conversations , but we must have them this book guides you in dealing positively with these situations and conversations to make the best possible outcome
this is a must read for anyone involved in communications with your boss , your colleagues , your clients , your suppliers , your spouse or partner , your kids , your friends \( have i missed anyone out \? \)
have you ever had a challenging conversation with a spouse , co worker , friend , or family member that did n't turn out so well \? did you ever wonder how to best deal with a significant person in your life without causing stress when needing to approach a topic \? the authors give great advise to handle most conversations that might otherwise cause stress
ever dread having to hold a difficult conversation \? i recommend this book for as basic training for anyone who has faced the prospect of speaking with bosses , co workers , employees about negative workplace behaviors , skill deficits , attitude issues , interpersonal conflicts , or blind spots
each time i read difficult conversations , i learn something new that is practical a must read for anyone looking to improve their understanding of family , friends and others
i'm writing this review of the 5 cd audiobook , not the book the cd is a must have , whether you 've read the book or not in it , actual examples are acted out of all kinds of conversations before and after the techniques are used after listening to the cd i can easily recall what to do when i find myself suddenly in a difficult conversation , because i 've actually heard it also , as you move through the sessions , the authors go just a bit deeper and deeper until one finds oneself admitting some very personal truths i think the reviewer below who recommends dale carnegie instead did n't hear the cds i did n't get the same result from dale 's books , as i have from listening to these cds the ultimate result of having listened to the series a few times \? i do n't get thrown off balance \( their term \) so often when i suddenly realize the other person is reacting negatively to what i thought was positive , and vice versa i just switch into a different mode and many times , the person \( either me or my companion \) has forgotten they were upset at all
i recently spent almost 300 of my own hard earned cash to buy this book from amazon and mail my friends their own copies yep , it 's that good
this is an excellent resource for talking about difficult topics , especially in areas that are highly charged e g in family life or in a couple
despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon , i really cant appreciate the value , usefulness or practicality of this book the proposed framework , that each difficult conversation is really three \( the what happened \? , the feelings and the identity \) conversations , is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem you may think i am a contrarian or a poor communicator however , with my very positive experience \( and reviews \) on books like how to win friends and influence people \? by dale calegie , get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again by david j lieberman , how to talk to anyone \? by leil lowndes and so on , i am obliged to warn potential buyers , in particular regular readers of relevant books , of a big disappointment
douglas stone demonstrates great awareness of the subject matter he states the principles and then illustrates them with powerful examples he made me think of my own approach in difficult conversations the person who buys this book will not regret the purchase
i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until now
my 2 kids \( and i \) have read all the 4 books \( and have bought 2 of them we 'll be getting the 5th one soon
i am always looking for as good as harry potter books look out harry , artemis fowl is here
i still think the first book is the best , but this is a close second and a much better book then the last installment i felt the same thrills and laughed at the same humor as the other books it brought to life more of the original spirit of the first book and the idea behind the series then the last two books it is another fantastic read from colfer , but all this being said , it just seems to be getting repetitive there are no new characters of interest , and the characters are n't developing all that much for a series with four books i am still unsure about getting the next one nevertheless , i suggest you read the first four
great book ! i loved the easy to read layout , the logical and clear organization and all the excellent tips along the way and the
good book , but there many well known questions and answers , i was looking for something more detailed
vicky oliver is a woman , lives in new york , and works in the advertising industry nothing wrong with any of that , except that she tends to forget that not everyone is exactly like her the result of this is that if , like me , you are a man , live in south carolina , and borrowed this book from your local library in order to prepare for an interview for an administrative position with the state highway patrol , much of the book might as well have been written in chinese good for urban professional women seeking executive positions , but of limited use to anyone else
bravo to vicky oliver for explaining the inside scoop on mastering the art of the interview she does so in an intelligent and entertaining fashion i found her recommendations to be witty , insightful and a valuable asset to anybody who needs to be able to persuade an audience , be it for a job interview or for that matter , anything else
this is the essential guide on how one should present oneself first impressions do matter this is book was also informative and entertaining at the same time
a second career attorney , i was looking to transition out of law and back into a pre law interest needless to say , despite my skills , talent , and having been around the block several times , i guess i must have slept through interviewing 101 vicky 's book and semininar enabled me to hone in on producing a better resume , turn supposed quirks weaknesses into strengths , answer difficult interview questions , and basically , duh , remember who i was she helped me nail the job , and frankly , i have n't been so happy in ages
i really enjoyed this book for the simple fact that it actually mentioned some new tricks instead of the same old ones , and it reiterated some old standbys that we all forget after time there is a lot of good \( un \) common sense to it , for new comers and seasoned alike as a recruiter myself , i would love it if everyone of my candidates would read this before coming to me , it would certainly impress me if they came up with just some of the answers in this book !
over the past twelve months , i have both interviewed for jobs and interviewed over two dozen potential employees only after reading this book did i realize how much i had to learn , whether being interviewed or trying to discern the quality of those i am interviewing 301 smart answers is an easy read , but filled with so many inciteful comments on how to effectively control the interview process , communicate your strengths and avoid the common pitfalls i am strongly recommending this book for anyone who plans to sit on either side of the desk
this is the best new job hunters book to come out in years ! vicky oliver 's answers are smart , insightful and will help any one get prepared for those interview questions that can take you by surprise all college grads should be issued this book with their diplomas
larry dossey is a prolofic writer and researcher on holistic healing , and in this book he assembles a number of articles and essays in support of a cohesive concept dossey invites the reader to explore the power of consciousness for healing transformation the different sections in the book sometimes refer to scientific theories and research , some of which would usually be considered in the realm of parapsychology , such as remote influencing , healing with prayer , non local telepathic communication , etc however , the focus is more on how these concepts can be applied in our lives to bring about healing dossey helps us peer beyond the veil of illusion we call reality to help us connect with the source of our being and the power of mind consciousness to transform having practiced mind body enegy medicine approaches such as hypnosis , reiki , and neuromodulation technique , i have experienced the power of the non local consciousness to create healing shifts in a manner that would appear magical or unbelievable to those convinced of the solid , objective nature of perceived reality it is much easier to bend spoons when one lets go of the illusion that there is any objective spoon in the first place ! enjoy this book and begin to put into practice the ideas and methods that unlock the power of consciousness
this collection of essays examines how thoughts and emotions affect our bodies and the bodies of others at a distance it is an insightful look at the relationship between science and unscientific topics like prayer , love , laughter , work , creativity , dreams and more , an examination of consciousness and spirituality in medicine everybody knows that something vital is missing in modern allopathic medicine the role of the human mind the author points out the deep level of ignorance within science about the origin , function and destiny of human consciousness but at last we are moving toward a vision of consciousness that liberates the mind from its identification with the physical brain and body of course , the implications for medicine are vast he refers to the ideas of jung , ken wilber , erwin schrdinger , david bohm and rupert sheldrake and makes a valid case for the fact that our power to heal and be healed extends beyond our physical bodes the essays fall into the three categories meaning , mind and nonlocality , and the book concludes with a bibliography , a section on sources and an index this is a classic and i recommend it to all who are interested in holistic or spiritual healing and those want to take responsibility for their own health
i bought the book to add to my collection of stained glass books i like the shapes and forms she uses and have gotten a few ideas from it very nice
another excellent read by a very talented yet underrated author thanks for the ride greg
i am a fan of greg iles it 's always good to see a mississippi boy make good in dead sleep , he introduces a fascinating premise and follows through with a tremendously entertaining though slightly flawed tale the good , the bad below
i like books that get me hooked in the first page or two , then keep me hooked till the end this was one of those books interesting plot that keeps you guessing till the end
having read iles earlier work spandou phoenix , i was thinking that this would be the same type of tense thriller all the way up to the end though this book is a fairly decent read , i was a little disappointed up front because the story is told in first person usually , this ruins the suspense because you know that nothing too bad is going to happen to the narrator the second objection i had was that the narrator is supposed to be female , while the writer is male this in itself is usually a turn off but the writer seemed to be able to pull off a somewhat convincing first person tale
this is a great book i was given it in a pile and recently picked it up and then could not put it down great characters , detail and story my wife stayed up until 3 in the morning to finish it read this book if you get a chance
ever since he hit the scene many years ago with spandau phoenix , i have followed greg iles' amazing career with a great deal of interest i do n't know of any author currently working that can hold a candle to his sheer talent for writing in such a wide variety of genre 's so far he has tackled historical thriller , legal thriller , supernatural , murder mystery and straight on action adventure thriller what genuinely sets mr iles apart is that not only has he written these many styles , but he quite literally commands each genre that he writes i know of no living author who has made such a wide attempt at writing , and certainly nobody who has ever managed to do it so incredibly well
greg iles' dead sleep depicts the thoughts of an independent career woman with eloquence the ability to show how frail the human psyche is when faced with dire family issues is outstanding issues of rape , child abuse and post vietnam stress compound the problems and are taken on with balanced composure
when jordan glass , a photographer known for seeking dangerous assignments , finds the lifeless form of her missing twin sister depicted in one of the paintings that are part of an exhibit of sleeping women in hong kong , little does she know that she is about to embark on a perilous journey searching for the connection between one or more artists and a series of kidnappings of women in new orleans , including her sister
if you 're acquainted with greg iles' work , you know that he 's a different author his books are very different one from another he changes subjects , pace , types of characters he 's able to write a legal thriller with the same easiness he writes a very fast kidnapping story with dead sleep , iles continues to prove at least to me that he 's one of the most talented thriller authors of the last ten years , along with michael connelly
man could buk write but could he write i suppose we are all just posers and pretenders and wanna bes in his shadow , but buk is essential reading for anyone interested in studying the craft and art and technique of writing , of , as buk would say 'laying down the word , ' and when it came to it , buk could do it better than anyone i 've tried to write a passage with as much simplicity and elegance and attitude as he had and failed completely his sparse prose and mastery of the obvious and attitude all contribute to a unique style in american letters that exemplify the beauty of our language when wielded by a master post office , hollywood , factotum and ham on rye are must reads for any serious student of modern writing and damned entertaining stories to boot
this had to be one of the most enjoyable books i 've read in years it 's actually based on bukowski 's life and the events that lead up to and involve the making of his movie barfly it 's totally off the wall , but bukowski 's take on hollywood 's own particular brand of insanity is probably just as true today as it was when charles bukowski penned this masterpiece of the absurd definitely a great book from one of my favorite writers highly recommended
excellent story about how charles' barfly movie came to be written in all honest candor and the trials an author has to endure throughout the system of getting this complete
although far from bukowski 's best , this is a revealing send up of what happens when brutal honesty \( buk \) interacts with the california entertainment industry a roman a clef about the making of the independent film barfly based on bukowski 's life and some of his earlier stories , the book shows bukowski finally gaining some recognition and acceptance near the end of his career the movie stars faye dunnaway and hollywood badboy mickey rourke who does a good job slurring and walking about with hemorrhoids yet it appears from the text that bukowski would have preferred sean penn , who was originally cast in the part , to play him in the film penn had more heart as always with bukowski , there are real emotions , honest appraisals , and bone cutting prose not compromise , pandering , mediocrity , and unfortunately often successful attempts by msg dazed writers to pluck the heart strings and collect the cash in all his books , bukowski 's presence is perhaps the most palpable of any author behind his fictional protagonist this is , one might argue \( and phillipe lacoue labarthe did , in the paradox of the actor \) , the diametric opposite of actors , whose abilities lie in taking on the personae of others , and consequently losing their own identity in the process the story is that when bukowski , although much older , first encountered arnold schwazenegger in hollywood , he had to be restrained from attempting to fight him just for being such an obvious phony far from his most testosterone crazed , drunken bull self here , he does not seduce but does manage as if for old time 's sake to pull onto his lap the pretty co star during a wine drenched film party even and especially when confronted with \( and making some money off of \) l a s billion dollar dream machine , bukowski \( as alter ego henry chinaski \) preserves his uncompromising heart and unwavering eye in the face of the ugly truth a welcome tonic to hollywood 's treacle
buk was right his take on screwie hollywood funny and true he was smart to stay clear of hollywood 's phonies and neurotics \( with the exception of writing barfly for the big screen \) see the flick by the way , doubt you 'll be disappointed unless you 've got a bit too much starch in your white collar buk wrote about blue collar down and outers like himself , and did it with a uniqueness and originality all his own
this novel by charles bukowski is basically the making of the movie barfly all of the people are recognizable even if given not so obvious fictional names if you are a lover of bukowski and a lover of barfly the movie , this is a five star classic if you are a lover of either of the above it 's still a four star , well written work i found that this novel exceeds both pulp and women , his other known longer works , in both writing style and movement of plot and characters theme wise it takes you to the familiar places that bukowski often drags you to
barfly is what first brought buk into my life , so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read it 's a bit goofy in spots \( some of the names buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous \) , but classic buk nonetheless why is n't buk taught in college english classes yet

boogey man
i have read this book twice now and have also read another of beahm 's books they are hands down great i originally picked up this book as a stephen king fan , but needed it for a school report it gave me so much more information than i could have possibly dreamed of while still be intriguing , it gives neat facts , important information and everything else about king 's writing career as well as his life do n't take this as a book of records though it 's a good book to pick up and read for pleasure there are many stories that are woven into this book as well as king 's family and life it 's a worthwhile book for any person who enjoys stephen king 's work as well as those who want to learn about the man behind the pages
i just read this book , \( in one sitting \) ! a must read for fans this book chronicles king 's work up to late last year \( '98 \) it almost reads like a novel itself i was absorbed by beahm 's willingness to focus on king 's work and not his private life \( something he makes note of in the book \) you 'll get a feel for where king has come from and how he 's evolving beahm even chronicles the movies \( most of which do n't do justice to the books \) my only complaint is the short stories in the collections were sparsely reviewed if your looking for a biography this is n't it ! !
george beahm has done his usual outstanding job as a biographer and stephen king expert i definitely and highly recommend this book
this is a big disappointment ! pictures are not all on one page the animals are split in half because of this what a dumb idea ! ! save your money this book is n't worth half of what i paid
elliott erwitt loves to take photos of dogs all kinds of dogs doing all kinds of things and woof is a reflection of his passion for the animal , providing black and white shots of dogs in or near water , on land , on display , at play , and more an outstanding , artistic celebration of the canine which dog and art lovers will find a satisfying blend of diverse images
i enjoyed the pictures in this book they show dogs of all ages in various positions the orientation on some pages is upright , on others , it 's sideways , so you turn the book to look at the picture straight on it 's a wonderful book to use to break the ice , or just to keep the conversation going the use of black and white photos was genius i found myself relating to the dogs as personalities color photos tend to make me think of the background more than the dogs
first of all the sender was wonderful with the time it took to get the book i received it in a day ! the book is wonderful and a great addition to any family who owns a dog a great picture book full of all kinds of breeds , although i would of liked to see more cocker spaniels !

the beauty is guerilla marketing falls within the standards of using multiple amazon com accounts to create very convincing and completely flattering reviews of books so that you sell more of them
this is one of my all time favorite marketing books i often refer to it time and time again a must read for every business owner , manager and entrepreneur !

what has happened to sue henry \? this book is such a let down i almost thought that she had someone else write it the story is flat and the sentence structures are confusing sorry to say that i really can't recommend this even though i wanted to
when a book title begins with murder at i know i am going to have a good time sort of reliving the old nancy drew days ! ! !

in his 1950 study of the authoritarian personality , theodor adorno constructed a political psychological profile of people he called pseudo conservatives these were people who called themselves conservatives but in truth adhered to political agendas that betrayed the ideals of individual freedom and free markets pseudo conservatives were motivated by hate , fear , and power , not the desire to conserve or guarantee liberty a few years later , the eminent historian richard hofstadter appropriated adorno 's term in describing what he called the paranoid style in american politics in adorno and hofstadter 's day , this paranoid style of pseudo conservativism was still in its embryonic state , personified by the rantings of joseph mccarthy but still far from being the game plan for the republican party as a whole david brock 's blinded by the right chronicles how this movement slithered its way into power long before anyone had heard of karl rove , whose name is n't even listed in the index
this book is a terrible exposure of the powers behind the \( extreme \) right in the us , of their methods , of their foot folk and their `morals'
david brock 's memoir , blinded by the right the conscience of an ex conservative , made the new york times best seller list , landing the author on good morning america and other prime time television shows in sixteen chapters with names like leninists of the right , a counter intelligentsia , and strange lie , the 378 page mea culpa names many familiar right wing names , enumerating the wicked behavior of brock 's erstwhile politically conservative accomplices his public soul searching caused me to free associate brock 's with a similar fascinating memoir published in poland by otto von hoess in 1947 von hoess similarly asked his readers for understanding and sought redemption for his wrongdoing after the fact because of its striking similarity , i 'll later get back to the nearly 60 year old mea culpa
brock 's book is a tale that should warn all of us about the dangers of political and cultural extremism , as well as blind devotion to an ideology this book also warns us that money in the american political system , in the hands of people with ulterior motives and lax morals , can potentially take over the entire system
this book is an excellent primer on how the religious right wing extremists have hijacked the republican party and dirtied the face of conservatism please note i did not call them christians , because i think these extremists have also blackened our name as well brock 's personal story illuminates the back story
1 president bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on pluto just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack
i was one of the new american spectator subscribers david brock writes about who were influenced by rush limbaugh and mr brock 's earlier writings i devoured anything anti clinton that was written during the early 90s and i was convinced that the sitting president was an immoral villain who deserved the castigation he received from the honorable republicans who relentlessly pursued him
as an australian who has begun to suspect that many american 'conservatives' are actually creepy bug eyed loons , i found brock 's diagnosis of their weirdness very absorbing
the reader interested in moss hart and the golden age of broadway will be much better served by going directly to steven bach 's biography brown 's workmanlike tome is short on style , short on feeling for the era \( something bach provides in spades \) , and the material from hart 's diaries does n't amount to much compare bach 's thrilling re telling of the birth of my fair lady with brown 's tepid version , to name one instance , and you 'll see why bach 's is by far the better book dazzler is indeed dazzling brown 's prince does nothing to de throne bach 's definitive bio and lacks dare i say hart
having recently discovered jared brown i have become a fan of his writing moss hart a prince of the theater was a welcome addition to his list of biographies deeply researched and well written , it was a joy to read and a font of information hart was an extremely interesting man , and his relationship with his wife , kitty carlisle , was heartwarming in fact carlisle is every bit as interesting as hart brown gives insight into the art of play writing , the emense amount of work involved and the talent of hart and his early partner , george kaufman from writing hart went to directing and was even more successful a gem of a book
moss hart a prince of the theater is a major achievement at first i wondered why even moss hart fans need another biography of the fellow so soon after steven bach 's well reviewed dazzler from a few years back for indeed moss hart is rather a forgotten figure nowadays , even though the august library of america published a collection not too long ago of kaufman hart 's biggest hits even his critically acclaimed musicals , jubilee and lady in the dark are today honored more in the breach than the observance , and his memoir act one is fading fast from cultural memory that 's not to say that , at any moment , he may return to our zeitgeist , and it 's great having his widow still around and performing at age 90 something still i hesitated before taking jared brown 's book off the shelf lol , back stage books issued the review copies of this title with the publication date of july 2007 printed on the back cover , so i did n't think there was any big hurry , that 's for sure they must have been thinking of 2006 , it 's just that there 's not much urgency to the topic nowadays
this book has been a tremendous help to not only me but my family as well whenever anyone of us as a problem with either our own dogs or the dogs next door we open the book and there is the solution ! it is easy to read and clearly gives the suggestions and why they will work and they do ! ms carlson has also been helpful with her phone consultations i do n't know how anyone with a dog manages without this book
provides guidance and examples of basic obedience training using positive reinforcement training with variable rewards good basic techniques believes that once a dog has learned the correct command and knowingly disobeys , a verbal no is appropriate well indexed and cross referenced 65 of the book is organized into specific problems , why your dog is doing it , what you should do or say , why the correction works and how to prevent the situation training methods recommend use of leash , collar , spay bottles , rattles , and lots of personal positive reinforcement techniques a very good , stick to the facts , basic training book
you do n't have to read the whole book to solve every problem you have with your dog just pick the problem and read that section this is the best book i 've ever read on how to deal with doggie issues it also helped me understand my dog 's mind and heart the best chapter is the one on what to do if your dog sniffs people 's crotches ! the author 's writing is entertaining , clear and quite funny i have given this book to over a dozen friends who got new puppies and they all swear by it ! read this book ! !
i really loved this book it 's amazing and so romantic we start with the first story which is opposite attract with ty and asher they had been lovers 3 years ago but asher had left ty to married someone else ty who thought had been played by asher come face to face with her at the tennis championships and a knew romance started with heated nights in each others arms but ty still did n't know why asher had left him 3 years early and was trying to figure it out but asher had a big secret that she did n't want ty to know about , but a their new romance gets more intense and secrets are too close to get revealed and change everything between them
i liked both stories , but i liked the heart 's victory the best it was great to see the couple get together after being apart for 6 years i loved getting a look into their lives after they were married , which is something we do n't get to do often in nora robert 's books also , the storyline took place in different cities countries , and it was great getting a look into the car racing world the main characters , foxy and lance were well developed , we get to see \( through flashbacks \) foxy go from a 14 year old girl with a crush into a grown woman who has realized that it 's true love
both books were similar in the sense that they both had a theme of past love 's that were now being faced in the present however , each situation is quite different , and so are the locations and charcters
even though mrs roberts' novels are a bit formulaic i still
creative and fast paced novel main characters are bigger than life enduring supporting characters , natural dialog , sensible storyline and satisfying conclusion this is a well written novel by a talented writer a must read
i'm sorry , but this book went way over my head was this the plan , or am i just not up to all this
i read this book as part of a personal effort , stretching back over a decade , to find answers to some of the deeper mysteries surrounding that gray area of minds , brains , computers , and souls an explanation for consciousness is central to such an undertaking this book , like so many others on this subject , served to raise a lot of fascinating questions , illuminate a little around the edges , but ultimately leave the big mysteries undisturbed
after reading again part of roger penrose 's exhaustive book , my tentative conclusion is as follows
whatsoe'er word that penrose has written , that word shall i read for it is my solemn duty to imbibe the ideas of another person , and come to grips with them this i style philosophy thank goodness i have rog' to argue for a philosophical position and of course there will be lots of people arguing against him they will all be jostling around like stock brokers on the floor of the exchange , waving little slips of paper , sweating , grimacing , their faces a gray screen with hustler faces moving across it but lets see , let me furrow my brow and adopt a serious expression when the words physicalism and mentalism are bandied let me puff on my pipe and say hmmmm at irregular intervals let me hear mention of john searle with a straight face for this is the stuff of life
godel 's theorem has been entirely overused !
i have own this book since it first came out , and to this day , i like to pick it up and read various chapters and times of harry s truman with this book , i feel as if i am standing right next to president truman at whatever stage of his life and feel like i am there , live and in person
the history of truman and his birth in the 1880s through ww1 ww2 as well as the cold war and korea is remarkable the evolution of a man from small town farmer to president of the united states and the weight of history thrust upon him at the expected death of fdr makes for a great read i found the difficulties in the post ww2 era to be most interesting such as the strikes and the creation of the truman doctrine and the marshall plan
i ca n't add much to what 's already been said in these reviews mccullough is a fantastic writer , and truman is one of the most under appreciated figures of the 20th century he lived during a pivotal time in american history , and presided over some of its greatest moments if you read john adams and liked it , you 'll like truman \( if you liked truman , may i recommend john adams \) as per his usual style , mccullough takes his time in telling the story \( the book is nearly 1000 pages ! \) , and stops to dwell on the characters involved he does it so well this is the sort of book that even casual readers of history could appreciate
as a republican thru and thru i came to this book with a huge bias against trumann , namely that i remembered him being one of jimmy carter 's hero 's ! however i was taking a long drive so i took the book on tape and wow ! david mccullough certainly demonstraits why he wown the pulizer prize by taking a man i was inclined to dislike , who social politics i tottally disagreed with and got me not only interested in the man but liking him
a truly remarkable , thoroughly enjoyable book ! having read john adams and 1776 , i was looking forward to reading truman with great anticipation this book exceeded my expectations ! while reading this book , it seemed as if it were warmly written by a close , caring family friend no skipping through long passages here so interesting and informative is mccullough 's style of writing , that i wanted to read each and every word he wrote i now have a greater appreciation for a much under appreciated president and all the noteworthy and far reaching events of truman 's era an added note about the large size of the book i placed a throw pillow on my lap underneath the book made it more comfortable to read since first reading john adams , i 've become an enthusiastic fan of david mccullough i plan to read each and every book he has written !
mccullough does an excellent job of writing a historical , yet interesting and personal biography about truman he includes his childhood , wwi experience , failed business venture , presidency , and retirement years what i like is his ability to be very historical and accurate , while remaining quite readable i had a hard time putting this one down
i was a little scared when this book first arrived it was huge \( almost 1 , 000 pages of text \) and i did n't really know much about truman so i was affraid i would n't be interested i am happy to say this ended up being an awesome book mccullough is my new favorite author after reading this book i feel like harry truman is an old friend that i 've known my whole life that is why i love mccullough 's work once i finished this book someone asked me if truman was my favorite president i did n't know what to say i ca n't say that i agreed with everything he stood for politically and he messed a few things up while in office but you have to love him for the man that he was and mccullough does a great job of capturing harry 's personality do n't just buy this book but all of mccullough 's books i have since read 'mornings on horseback' and 'john adam' is on order
this is awesome , the book is huge , but just incredible i loved it
i must say as a fan of history and american politics i have enjoyed all of mccullough 's books that i 've read to date and truman is easily one of his masterpieces however , i think mccullough fails to inform his reader of some important details while portraying the life of harry s truman for example , mccullough portrays truman as a heroic visionary acting courageously to prevent the spread of communism into south korea but fails to mention that the democracy truman was protecting was a military dictatorship other than that , this book is a great read about a great man and admittedly mccullough 's oversights are innocuous to the finished product
this book is a great source of information that helps in a pinch i recommend this book to all who own pets
this is a great book to have if you own a cat or dog ! i 've used it more than i ever thought i would from destructive behavior to depression to obesity this book covers alot of issues pets suffer from and can be helped by their human gaurdians i volunteer at an animal shelter and i see everyday how quick people give up on their pets before you make that decision get this book and give your pet the time , patients , and the second chance they deserve ! !
i have purchased many books on pet care i honestly think this is one of the best i have ever had it is filled with ideas to help your pet in a natural way its a must have for any dog owner
this book is filled with good advice for pet owners almost every type of pet health problem is discussed in this book unfortunately , because the book covers both dogs and cats some of the information is brief this is a good reference book for pet owners i would recommend this book to people who own both a dog and a cat and need a good overview of pet health if you have only a dog , or only a cat , you might want to get a health book that is more detailed for your type of animal
for an experienced assembly language programmer looking to apply c programming to embedded systems , this book has just the approach that suits my needs logically organized and very readable , it keeps layering concept upon concept , subtley bringing in different techniques , while informing not only about the language , syntax and use , but also about how compilers interact with various constructs i also enjoyed the well thought out example programs and exercises
after having unsuccessfully searched for the perfect c tutorials and also k r c , i can confidently report that this is by far the best introductory text to the c language you can think of it as k r in a truly tutorial mode very complete coverage of language features and just the right amount of instructional aid without being too terse on the one hand \( k r \) and without being to plodding and wordy on the other \( deitel and others \) you should find it as a thorough yet relatively quick read kochan has a very nice writing style which makes the tutorial also very enjoyable and rewarding the example programs are short and sweet very similar to the kinds of programs found in k r there are also lots of appropriately challenging programming exercises at the end of each chapter and half the answers are available on the author 's website \( www kochan wood com \) another good feature is that the tutorial is arranged by subject matter so you can use it also as a user friendly reference in addition to k r
if not the best computer related book i 've read the author 's unassuming and eloquent discourse makes reading the book a very interesting proposition the manner in which the topics are covered are absolutely great and very intuitive the books is absolutely well structured and well supported it was surely a surprise to find a computer programming book where the author was candid and unambiguous as a programmer coming from java i found this book to be quite helpful and straight forward the chapter on pointers and references does a superb job at getting the reader to understand the concept and to be able to apply it the appendices are also great with lots of handy information this is one of the few computer books that i actually dare to recommend buying without any qualms
i was still left scratching my head after having read twice and attempting the problems in k r literally , i was excited as i read kochan 's book his presentation is so clear , with the right balance of explanation and examples without being too wordy vague simplistic \? \( sams c in 21 days \) or too terse \( k r \)
i suggest this book to anyone who wants to , or are thinking of , delving into c no matter how deep !
as someone who is very familiar with programming logic using vba but who has never stepped foot near c or c , i found this book to be a great book technical books can quickly turn into fire kindling if there details that are not fully explained , but so far i have not found a single character of code that is not explained in the book the book also manages to not be a bible on c , it only presents key programming tools and common , practical programs an awesome book for both beginners and those who are familiar with programming and simply need the c vocabular
read this book and learn how it 's supposed to be done ! as for programming books , i 've wasted money on some 'stinkers' over the past 20 years , and i 've browsed through many more in bookstores that i quickly realized were n't worth buying this book , however , is not only the best introduction to c programming , it may be the most well written programming book ever published it 's a step by step guide with concise examples that are clearly explained no previous programming knowledge is necessary i must point out , however , that i'm reviewing the version from 1988 \( before 'ansi' was added to the title then removed again \) i'm sure the current 2004 version is even better i just ordered kochans' book programming in objective c without reading a word of it and i'm not worried at all that it was a waste of money thanks stephen
i loved how this book addressed pointers probably the best i 've seen good logical presentation recommended for anybody who wants to learn c !
nafisi 's memoir , reading lolita in tehran , takes its readers deep into the life of a woman living under the ever increasing repression of the iranian regime she is an academic whose love of books drives her to use them as lenses through which to view the horrifying events that surround her each of the book 's four sections takes the works of a different author and uses them to illuminate aspects of the oppressive islamic regime under which she lives the book presents a startlingly vivid picture of day to day life in iran as suffered by a woman who , though very intelligent , is unsure of whether her allegiances lie with her government or with the west though nafisi explains the political events surrounding the iranian revolution and the iran iraq war , she does so not from the view of the history that 's been written , but from the view of a citizen living in the times , providing an essential shift in perspective
although many people might question whether everything in this novel is true or not , it states on the front that it is a memoir , therefore that is how i thought of it while reading as far as i am concerned , everything but the names and some situations \( to protect individuals \) is the truth , and since i have not been to tehran , i would not know any different i found this book captivating in most every way from the detailed descriptions of the girls in the book club to the references to other novels such as the great gatsby although i have not read all of the books nafisi referenced in her memoir , i still understood her story and appreciated her sharing the private \( or public \) moments with her readers i was shocked when i read about some of the laws that women \( and men \) must obide by in iran , and this book sparked my interest regarding the stunning ways of the country enough from the very beginning to encourage me to look even further into the culture being a secondary education english major , i would suggest this book to anyone from the age of 13 on , with hopes that he or she would read it , appreciate it , and try to gain some knowledge on a very different culture than our own while recognizing the everyday freedoms we take for granted on a daily basis
if anyone wants to know what living in post revolution iran is like for a woman , this is the book great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state the scariest thing , for me , is how closely the vision of iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the u s held by christian extremists this touched me with reality the way the handmaid 's tale by margaret atwood touched me with fictional possibility
i'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face \( same would go if i were reviewing the fear of flying or a room of one 's own , both of which are far superior to this outing , although of different genres \) , but i 'll go ahead and write one anyways nafisi 's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in tehran did n't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students i know i may get lambasted for saying so , but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion instead , we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general the layers of interpretation for a character such as humbert is simplified to either he 's a villian or a misunderstood villian , neither of which deals with many of the nuances nabakov has included you would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students the strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the west who comes back to iran to teach i think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context , yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave english professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country on a more stylistic level , i was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text , as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them , actually become a massive blob without much indivuality i had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else , even though he does play an important role , although a subtle one in many scenes i think i expected a lot from this novel that i could n't get from picking up a newspaper and i did n't get much beyond that
in all honesty , upon first reading the course list for engl 474 issues in rhetoric , i did not immediately understand why this book was in the course list but , now that we 're halfway through the book , i understand quite well this book answers some questions that i 've had in my own mind regarding why certain books are banned the book discusses gatsby , by fs fitzgerald , as it is a work studied by the author 's class in the tehran u i read gatsby twice in highschool and never considered it a controversial work however , in american society , we are well acquainted with the idea of cheating on spouses , for example , \( as it is always all over the news tabloids at the grocery store who 's cheating on who , etc \) which is one of the issues that the islamic students in nafisi 's class found disturbing but in iran , however , during the revolution , everything was controversial but the concept of adultery to nafisi 's characters is completely heinous so , culture plays a huge role in why works are banned or are considered controversial
reading lolita in tehran \( rlt \) is a persian variation on one day in the life of ivan denisovich both are about surviving cruel , arbitrary tyrants
i loved this book ! finally a woman brave enough to stand up for women 's rights and freedoms in iran too bad she could n't bring her female students with her to america to enjoy the many gifts their teacher gave them through literature as a american muslim
like the hero of all the pretty horses , the first book in cormac mccarthy 's border trilogy , billy parham is a teenager who crosses the border into mexico , where he must struggle for survival at a primitive level at first , he makes the crossing to release a wolf he has trapped and cannot bear to kill later , he returns with his brother in the course of this novel , billy undergoes just about every misfortune it is possible to encounter , becoming progressively more wretched until the final pages , an understated vignette with a potent , heartrending effect
this is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story , but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this border trilogy mccarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of all the pretty horses and instead became much more wordy and allegorical i appreciated the straight ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time in the crossing , the language was as beautiful , but there were often stories and sub plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book these asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters , but for me weakened the story
just re read again great story , brilliantly written it 's readers will appreciate the wolf over most of their human acquaintances
i feel that cm really excelled in this second book of the trilogy while i thought that pretty horses was quite wonderful , the crossing really works its way into one 's mind and soul character development , scene description , dalogue are superb one of the best books i have read
billy parham sets about tracking a she wolf roaming his father 's land , but by the time he traps it , he finds he has gained a respect and understanding of it and ca n't bring himself to kill it billy muzzles the wolf and pulls it by horseback into mexico to set it free as is the course of things , fate eventually separates the two , and the wolf ends up in a ring baited by dogs billy delivers a mercy killing in a moving scene as the bloodied wolf is held by the collar up against his leg , the crowd looks on he trades his rifle for the dead wolf 's pelt i do n't reckon i know exactly why and heads back to the states , where he finds his home and life have changed forever
the crossing by cormac mccarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of america the story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from mexico the wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her this part was particularly well written , but became confusing when spanish was being used heavily in review of this part i believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues the short lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons
the crossing is set in new mexico and mexico in the late 1930s , during the last days of the wild west before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all
the border trilogy continues with the crossing in the book 's early going , sixteen year old billy parham visits an eccentric old mexican man who is rumored to be a brujo billy seeks this man 's advise regarding the ways of wolves as billy has been stymied in his attempts to trap a wolf who has wandered into new mexico from mexico as billy is helping the old man rise up from his bed , mccarthy writes the boy almost put his hat on the bed but he caught himself now what is that supposed to mean , you may ask perhaps some western readers of mccarthy may know the reference here , but for rest of you , here goes
having read all the pretty horses , blood meridian , and now the crossing , i feel a little compelled to comment
if you do n't mind having your brains twisted by stories within stories within stories , your brain will change from being a 98lbs weakling to a taller , stronger brain
the book is a collection of intertwining , often hilarious , stories of various natures , styles , and character gothic , romance , a singular mathmatician , erotica , chivalry , adventure , greed , religion from many perspectives it seems that this novel deserves to be more popular , it fits the modern attention span with its substratum of vignettes , and the larger grand story that encompasses them , a timeless tale the book is funny and the message profound , but of the bewildering conundrum sort that some great poems often leave one with , as the story intertwines the symbols of various lives into something that was mature and introspective but uplifting and cathartic it does n't rely on words but on situations to do this so probably losses little in translation as many poems do if anything it leaves one with stronger sense of brotherhood and love for one 's neighbor definitely fits with modern multiculturalism , or what it should be anyway , and i guess the author was also a freemason a strange bag of humanism i will never forget some of the images , potocki had quite an imagination
this is yet another chinese puzzle of a book with stories within stories within stories , reminiscent of charles maturin 's melmoth the wanderer and just as crazy a soldier who travels through a haunted land and spends the night romping with two lovely sisters and awakens with a rotting corpse on either side rosicrucians and the wandering jew and a whole spectrum of memorable characters and ghostly goings on penned by a genius polish count and pioneering aeronaut who commited suicide with a silver bullet to the brain , this book is the mental equivalent of climbing rocks without a safety , or flipping 360 's on a trail bike , or snow boarding down a cliff you 've got to keep the mind sharp and keep balanced on the cusp of the page or you will wipe out badly ! yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! get it , you extreme dudes ! oh yeah
i discovered and read manuscript found in saragossa earlier this year and i cannot get it out of my head ! it 's everything i ever wanted in a fantasy novel ghosts , ghouls , occult philosophy , gypsies , romantic landscapes , murder amp mayhem , the kabbalah and sex what more can a bibliophile want \? treat yourself get a copy as quickly as possible though i prefer the christine donougher translation to ian maclean 's she more successfully captures the surreal whimsy of the narrative that i feel was potocki 's intention
a latticework of tales within tales , ranging from gothic horror , to comedy , to arabian night style adventures the horror element is more pronounced at the beginning of the novel , and the loose ends are tied up rather too rapidly at the end , but the tales themselves are so well written that they carry you along by their own strengths if you are looking for a simple linear narrative , beware the novel skips from tale to tale , and characters within tales often tell their own stories , so it can be demanding of the reader 's memory in that sense , the structure is more akin to the time and place shifts used by some modern novelists the reader 's patience is rewarded by a work far superior than boccaccio , and much better than anything produced by lawrence norfolk
dont know much about history does pretty much what it purports to do fill in certain blanks in us history in a concise , almost too concise , manner it is quite objective and makes no attempt to re write history to promote a particular political leaning until the final chapters then it is fairly clear that dr davis leans a bit away from the status quo this poses no real problem , as most of the viet nam generation are quite negative as to how that was handled now , the next edition of this book , which will of necessity deal with irak , will be a very interesting read
this was absolutely the funniest parody i have ever read the eager repetition of the supremem court interpreted the 14th amendment to give civil rights to corporations as the single worst argument to ever come forth from that body was one of the funniest lietmotif 's in this hysterical parody of us history told from the standpoint of an over the top marxist worse than cowboys were businessmen ! ! eugene debs and web dubois were the only white americans who were not evil !
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one to notice the anti white preaching in this book not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that i was expecting to learn a lot more most of the things mentioned i already knew i graduated from high school in '89 and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education
davis 's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling white men were all bad , indians were good women were brave conservatives are anti semites republicans are bad and pro business anti communism was silly and all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor 's filter mr davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy this is offensive when it neglects margaret sanger 's racism , and communist depredations
kenneth c davis presents an unvarnished look at the history of america from columbus to mid 2002 his viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that america is always right and good , but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way for example , it exposes jackson , sherman , and others for their mistreatment of the indians but does n't actually condemn them it explains washington and jefferson 's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them
i do n't know if this is one of the essential historical works , but it is definitely one of the most fun kenneth davis strives to provide a remarkably comprehensive and centrist survey of american history by addressing a series of questions that structure the work as a whole for the most part , he articulates the standard current few of the various figures he treats
short , concise , and to the point chapters great wealth of knowledge and trivia
nafisi 's memoir , reading lolita in tehran , takes its readers deep into the life of a woman living under the ever increasing repression of the iranian regime she is an academic whose love of books drives her to use them as lenses through which to view the horrifying events that surround her each of the book 's four sections takes the works of a different author and uses them to illuminate aspects of the oppressive islamic regime under which she lives the book presents a startlingly vivid picture of day to day life in iran as suffered by a woman who , though very intelligent , is unsure of whether her allegiances lie with her government or with the west though nafisi explains the political events surrounding the iranian revolution and the iran iraq war , she does so not from the view of the history that 's been written , but from the view of a citizen living in the times , providing an essential shift in perspective

buy this book because you want to be able to use vba to help you at work i wrote a program to automatically generate and send reports via email about 500 of them and my boss was in awe
in spite of being an advanced book , difficult concepts are explained clearly and in a very simple way
the depth of excel development knowledge of the authors can be readily seen a few pages into the introduction if you have been frequent visitors to excel vba programming newsgroups like myself , you will notice immediately that all three authors are well recognized experts in this domain , and have answered countless tricky questions on the topic of excel vba in my opinion , the particularly valuable chapters include
i 've been working with excel for years
this book is a fantastic edition to any programmer 's skillset
i have got this book the comment on cover page says it is for the serious developer who is creating advanced applications well i say it is a must read for any vba programmer who wants to write good quality code every line that i have read so far has a meaning the book is written in a simple fluent language and brings out the point very clearly it will take me to the next level of programming
working with excel since ten years and writing add ins with vba and also by using the c api , i can claim myself as an experienced user
the typical excel programming book is often like a vba cookbook just a succesion of vba code snippets and at the end the reader has a nice collection of vba recipes , but does n't really know how to cook this book will show the reader how to cook
book for no vba beginners and about professional applications
and the band played on is an act of phenomenal research and writing , and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling , political bumbling , and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many , the scientific in fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives , and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives , but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they did n't want to do the work , did n't want to spend the money , or did n't want to anger certain political groups gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many
good stories work on several levels they are multi dimensional views of the same event to honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the aids epidemic , i reread randy shilts 's groundbreaking work , which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the cdc
to me this important expose on the begining of the aids crises and reagan 's response is extremely important it 's now classic and old information but it 's a valuable history lesson we all must read
the sexual revolution is over , wrote an old revolutionist named p j o'rourke , and the microbes won this book , by an sf journalist now dead from aids , tells how the microbes won the war
you want to read a horror story \? this is it this is the shameful way our government dealt with aids in the first six years it appeared in the country by doing nothing at all
having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but , this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy , it is extremely informative and , if read with an open mind , refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on just to let the information sink in
having seen the film that this book is based on several times , i was curious to read into the whole story and this book does not pack any punches
the amazing part of this tragedy is that shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans , directly or indirectly
i was required to read this text for a class i would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure i found that this text is very attention grabbing , and it is extremly informational i would recommend this text to others
shilts' great book shows us how much of the aids related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided the book opens with the july 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of american independence and closes with the death of hollywood star rock hudson , whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous aids casualties could not
type smudges translation bad in short , a disposable boo
who published these weak translations \? yup , they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper \? b n needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality
the brothers' grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales , and they can be enjoyed by all ages i think i enjoyed them most when i read them to my own children , but i have read them again since , and enjoyed them again i read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go , so to speak the brothers' grimm were not writers by profession they were scientific philologists , but decided to make up a collection of folktales they spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources , and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them everyone knows these tales , but to name a few the frog prince , rumplestiltskin , cinderella and sleeping beauty these tales have endured and been loved for many years , and disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them read them for your enjoyment , and to recapture a little of your lost youth
you do n't need to trust me you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the frog king which is unreadable someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper this does not do justice to the tales
when i received this book , i was amazed by how great it was the condition was very good i was so plesed by it it was so clean , and looked untouched i am very happy with it thank you for doing a great job this is the first time i have ever bought anything on the net i was kind of scared about it i know i can buy from you guys and not worry about it e
while i'm sure the stories are great , i ca n't get past the poor type setting , and cheap paper which is practically newsprint the words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult and to make matters worse , the stories are set in a terrible , hard to read font and tight leading this book is not kid friendly at all yuck ! same is true of the hans christian andersen fairy tales by same author publisher
the book is a bit rough in places and lacks some of the crisp dialog i have come to expect , but all of that is overshadowed by the good points of the book buy the book , enjoy it and support sir francis
it 's really good to have dick francis back in the saddle , or rather at the typewriter
dick francis is back ! rejoice !
i was so happy to find a dick francis book after so many years , and written in his usual format sid halley , in his usual form and thesubject matter was great i am not a good writer , but , believe me , if you are looking for an enjoyable read , pick up under orders and start in
i began reading under orders one evening and literally could not put it down
it has been a long drought
i 've long been a fan of dick francis , since he first began writing in the 60s his earlier books were my favorites , as i loved the milieu of the steeplechasing world i loved some of his later works too , but was saddened as the scene moved further and further from the racing world

while taking a rather different direction from jane austin , the picture of shifting class options , alignments , and calculations reminds one of pride and prejudice shirley hazzard 's writing is lucid and clear , her comparisons illuminating although not as much so as the great fire , it is a book of great economy in telling a great story well
shirley hazzard is australian by birth , but her extensive life experiences make her a wise world citizen after winning the usa national book critics' award in 1980 , this book should get more attention than it does an amazing love triangle forms the plot , but it 's the writing that takes my breath away , as well as the post wwii history on three different continents and the vividly drawn characters i 'll admit i had trouble getting into it at first , but persistence paid off so that by the startling revelations at the end of the book , i was ready to start it again
the only reason i finished the transit of venus was the hope of any improvement this book took away two hours of my life two hours that i can never earn back by reading true literature the story \( is there a story \? \) is dreadful the sentence structures , the paragraph performances , the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if ms hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self perceived insights i will never recommend this book to any audience ms hazzard and her publisher should refund my money
the transit of venus is an extraordinary piece of modern literature hazzard has a special talent for combining words on a page this talent is truly and uniquely illustrated here her similes and metaphors , her adjectives and adverbs , her incisive psychological look at the characters inner thought processes and pattern are all here beautifully put together
this novel was written with intelligence , insight and focus which demands the same from its reader shirley hazzard assumes the reader is well read on matters regarding literature , poetry and international politics which is refreshing in fiction this is not a light read the language is dense , erudite , often the sentences do not breathe , but the story is engrossing and rewarding suspenseful , until the last chapters when all is revealed
i read this book about 20 years ago , but when i picked it up again , i did n't remember a thing about it except that back then i did n't like it i liked it this time , but found the writing pretentious why should i read entire paragraphs without understanding them when i have read , understood and enjoyed other difficult books from tolstoy to bellow to atwood \? maybe the problem is that this is british from an unfamiliar era oh , well i did n't really like any of the characters caro was cold , grace a whimp , christian self involved , ted a martyr , paul egocentric the protraits of minor characters such as caro 's fellow office workers were the best part of the book the plot was nothing much and the end well , did they live happily ever after or not \? i could n't figure it out
i must confess that i have only finished two of the short stories thus far but from the moment i read the dedication i suspected that i would not be dissapointed and have so far not i adored the known world and find myself being at once drawn in and recoiling with jones 's writing the subject matter is often heartbreaking yet he writes with such confidence , beauty and clarity that i ca n't help but hunger for the next page i do n't know that this book is for everyone \( it is n't tom clancy or stephen king if that is what you are looking for \) , but if you enjoyed the known world or the writings of toni morrison , this is the book for you
one of today 's most compelling author weaves stories about how lives change due to tragedy
reviewed by joanna pearson for small spiral notebook
according to hebrew legend \( see chapters 16 and 21 of genesis , the first book of the torah \) , sarah was the wife of abram , and hagar was the servant of sarah it was a middle eastern custom in those times that a wife could give her slave to her husband and the child thus conceived would be counted as the child of the wife the child born to hagar and abraham was given the name ishmael
i usually do not read short stories , i just love novels , however , because it was by the author of the known world i had to read this edward p jones has written a thoughtful , well crafted , haunting collection of short stories the root worker makes you wonder about the choices that you make in your life , and how they can haunt you riveting
there is no one else like edward jones writing today imagine someone writing with the elegiac tone and richness of language of doctorow mixed with deep emotion and you get mr jones in these stories , the lives of ordinary citizens of washington dc come to life in a way that gives testimony to the creative spirit in a literary world crowded with the talented and clever but short of heart , mr jones is the real deal , someone who writes with intelligence for readers who love to read serious fiction and care about the human condition with his three books of fiction , mr jones has reached the rarified air of the greats of american literature if you are passionate about serious writing , you 'll read these stories again and again they are that good
the best writers or at least the most memorable are the ones who can break the rules of writing and somehow still tell a great story or convince us of something jones often changes points of view , shifts time , and fills his stories with a variety of characters he seems to lack the ability to write a one dimensional , uninteresting character even the one or two stories in the collection that i did n't particularly like left me wanting to read more and i felt as i read the stories that each was so well wrought and imagined that jones could easily turn them each into novels
this collection of stories really has depth and insight edward p jones writes about the black community in washington d c with great compassion and understanding there is considerable heartbreak here , but it is presented with such sensitivity and authenticity that it is hard to put down jones needs to get some more awards with this one it is beautifully crafted literary work that deals with the real world

i thought that this book would be one that would be mediocre when i started it , but good gracious , was i mistaken ! it was a wonderful series of tales that i could n't put down i rarely read such interesting stories and the ones featured here are gems
shipler has compiled a great deal of first person accounts and analyzed them in such a way that the reader cannot deny the truthfulness and depth of the arguments a must read for all
i found david shiplers book to be very true and to the point being a person of color , i already know how we \( people of color \) feel about race relations i found it most helpful to see it through the eyes of a white male i have been tempted to buy a box of this book and carry it with me to give to people i believe everyone should read this book and debate the content of course , not everyone will agree , but for those who are just beginning to explore race relations , this is a great introduction and a most interesting read
three fourths of the way through this book , i am blown away by what i have read so far it is not an easy book to read , especially for someone like me , who has led a pretty sheltered life although i knew about 'slavery' and civil rights' and thought myself to be pretty educated , this book makes me realize that i have known nothing of the real world , the one that african americans , and other oppressed people , live in i really appreciate the chance that this book has given me to see the world and live the day through their eyes i find myself thinking about it all the time do blacks really think of me like that \? i wonder do i ever do this unconsiously \? this is the kind of book that makes you ache for company to discuss it to debate it to share if you belong to a book club , this should be your next read ! i cannot say enough about how it has stirred my emotions , my imagination , my shame , and my sadness
as the white father of black white inter racial children , i needed to better understand some of the reasons and motivations driving racist behavior shipler 's book took me through several on point situations that have arisen in my life and enabled me to understand how color blind people can continue to discriminate through their actions and deeds shipler 's ability to observe and report without scathing judgemental attacks enhances the book 's credibility our copy of the book now has many dog eared pages that will be shared with friends , teachers and others my decision to purchase the book is an interesting story our third grade daughter , returning from school recess with play tossed hair , was told by her white teacher , gee , your hair looks like don king 's ! even though our little girl had no idea who don king was , we confronted the teacher about this inappropriate comment the teacher was insulted that we could assume she was biased in any way that evening , npr interviewed mr shipler , and the book was ordered from amazon com within the hour shipler 's book points out that many of us are convinced we are not racist or biased , however , our upbringing and the input we have received living in a racist country leaves many of us with residual habits that are percieved by others as racist ways these are very difficult habits or attitudes to change , however , his book should enable many readers to anticipate and prevent behavior that may be interpreted as insulting by those of different colors or cultures
h g wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent , world dominating british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way , particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world \( read colonize \) for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that attitude on a pedestal , and although he did n't knock it down , he made his point and in spectacular fashion in one way , the martians were the conquering british , with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the british despite their firm belief in their world destiny could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british \( or anyone else 's \) false boast of superiority in the end , though , it 's a hopeful book just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world , wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british \( alien \) way was not the native way of life in the colonies , suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that , it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense
war of the worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but i kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to hg wells' original story , especially the mis judged spielberg cruise flick so i decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by the modern library looked rather sleek and sexy i know it 's sad , but i like my books to look good
beware the war of the worlds is nothing like the movie with tom cruise it 's better it 's interesting to look back at at life 100 years ago and see how they used the little technology they had to fight off the enemy this book is entertaining if you can put yourself in the era that it was written it 's not easy to understand , however there is a lot of old english
i consider the war of the worlds to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time it has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time the original story is set in england at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story
the martians have arrived let the war begin a catchphrase that could easily be employed for herbert george wells 's most acclaimed science fiction the war of the worlds this is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on mars composed in a first person narrative , the war of the worlds is a gripping saga of the millions of people 's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good
h g wells' war of the worlds is a wonderfully imagined science fiction novel but it is also a biting commentary on its era and on the evils of british imperialism in the late victorian era
i 've been reading novels for a long time , i like sci fi , but sometimes i'm very selective when buying a sci fi with war of the worlds , well , this was different i 've seen the different films , etc i decided to read the novel to my surprise it was more interesting than any of the movies or any other thing i 've read
it is n't embarrassing for me to admit that this was n't my first gabriel allon read by silva probably like a lot of others , i started somewhere in the middle so , when i read the confessor , i had to fill in a few blanks for myself i left some of my questions unanswered until i got to find out where it all began , and here it is the kill artist ! i wondered if silva would have really made it interesting for those who thought they knew about gabriel allon and ari shamron i had some stuff to learn , and what i never knew was some life restored for me !
the kill artist is the first book in daniel silva 's gabriel allon series and is a good start to a great series !
in the kill artist daniel silva introduces readers to gabriel allon , a retired mossad secret agent i admit i have read gabriel allon books out of order this was my third gabriel allon book , but the kill artist is the first in the series silva is worth reading for several reasons his european and middle eastern settings are extremely well researched an accurate he does not just set his scenes in the most well known and popular areas of israel , london , or germany , but in the ethnic suburbs , run down areas , and other lesser known regions this gives the book a real authentic feel
having read a few other books by silva i figured this would be good no mistake , it was very good i enjoyed his walking you through all the steps in the tracking of a terrorist what has to be done and sometimes hurting your own to accomplish the capture all in all a very well written book i recommend it highly
i have become a daniel silva fan and i enjoyed this book , but it was not one of those books that you feel like you ca n't put down stay up all night types his more recent books are better
this book is chronologically the first in the gabriel allon series
i knew nothing about daniel silva when i bought this he happened to be one of the featured authors at my local borders location so i figured i 'd give it a try wow was i surprised gabriel allon is a great character and he 's not made into a superman of sorts he 's very human i'm glad i stumbled onto this series and plan on reading all of them
latest in the series about gabriel alon
the first book in the gabriel allon series is right on the mark daniel silva maintains a good balance of character background building with fast paced action
this is the first book featuring gabriel allon , an israeli agent who poses as an art restorer the only reason that i gave this book 4 stars is that the next book in the series , the english assassin , is even better
this is the best book i have ever read about the stock market , selecting stocks and indicating the best times to invest and when to stay out of the market
zweig made his reputation as a market timer , and 2 3 of this book presents a detailed market timing model that incorporates both money indicators \( e g prime rate , fed funds rate , consumer debt \) and a basic momentum indicator the model is relatively simple and the method is clearly explained according to zweig 's data , the system produced remarkable results up through the final revision of this book \( in 1996 \)
do n't focus just on technical analysis to trading in fact , zweig claim his not sure if all those double bottoms and other chart patterns really work he takes sound fundemental and realistic approach to investing and trading
i almost hate to tell you how good this book is , for fear that zweig 's stock screen will quit working for me if too many people know about it i read the book , and in early 2005 i started using zweig 's stock screen \( us stock market \) the s p500 made less than 5 in 2005 , but i made 36 in 2005 on my portfolio using zweig 's screen ! here 's how i did it
this is one of the best books on the stock market i cannot imagine anyone doing a top down analysis of the market without having first read this book zweig , a wharton graduate and phd , looks at the monetary , momentum , and sentiment indicators \( among others \) that affect the djia , s p 500 , and the valueline \( tm \) unweighted price index i think it is unfortunate that we have not heard from dr zweig in quite some time \( i cannot remember the last time i heard him mentioned on tv , and if i'm not mistaken his newsletter is no longer printed \) and the book is somewhat dated \( revised in 1997 \) still , zweig 's winning on wall street is still a good read
this is by far the best investing book i have read i just gave jim cramer 's book , real money , a 3 star rating for lack of usable info on top of his 400 pages of egoistical ramble
as a matter of fact martin zweig is one of the few phds who 's able to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words the same thing ca n't be said about the contemporary authors of various market , finance or economics books published over the last years
marty is a genius in his simplicity the books shows the clarity of his thought process and deep market experience the book 's highly effective techniques would mostly be relevant in a non deflationary enivronment the book 's monetary model timing techniques would work in say 90 of the situations but could cause major financial demage in relatively rare defaltionary situations such as 2001 2002 when the monetary model \( and the overall super model \) gave a buy signal my humble advice to any follower of these models would be to increase the 4 percent model weighting to 50 of the overall super model during uncertain times that should ensure that one enters exits only when the tape mandates it \( along with the monetary indicators \) and thus limitng any major damage when the monetary model fails as it did in 2001 2002 perhaps mr zweig should update this book or even better write a completly new book as the markets have evolved a lot since the early 90 's he owes it to investing humanity and should further share his god given talent for the common good
only one other city is so steaped in architecture history than chicago and this guide does a commendable job of highlighting the most important chicago buildings , the synopsis on each building is susinct , the only qualm i have is that there are not more pictures , i also wish the authors had ventured more into the suburbs and commented on some of the great houses in lake forest and highland park , but that omission does not mar the overall enjoyment of this scholarly guide if you are interested in architecture at all , i recommend you pick up this book , chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples
having lived 60 of my life outside the usa in various countries , i 've often been surprised at how unhappy many americans appear to be in the poor countries where i 've lived \( third world \) , people generally seem happier , friendlier , more willing to share give and less stressed even though they have much less \( material goods , that is \) those of you who have travelled , that is , actually gotten off the beaten path , the megaresorts , the disneyfied locations , to places like the phillipines , colombia , honduras , mexico , guatemala , peru , etc , have probably noted the difference
the authors of this book are concerned americans are n't doing what they should specifically , to paraphrase former president bill clinton , they 're not spending their money right they value things they should n't they work too much they own too much they shop at evil big box stores like wal mart so , with paternalistic concern in their hearts , they have written this book to warn us that we 're in need of a correction
basically an interesting , revealing if not alarming book , with loads of data , some striking graphs , and several silly cartoons the authors have a bullet point approach to the topic , with short chapters \( 30 chapters in 247 pages \) and multiple headings within each chapter the data themselves are quite compelling , even if the writing style is not
i was very much looking forward to recieving this title from amazon com after reading the first few pages online and , admittedly , i did like the first few chapters however , the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly , and became almost smug and self aggrandizing the authors seemed far too pleased with themselves , and , by approximately the halfway point i felt as if i were reading some kind of bizzare conservationist manifesto i like to think as a self appointed conservationist and vegan that i try to mind mother nature and all living creatures , but after i finished reading this repetitive , pedantic bore , i lost the will to care maybe i am being too harsh , but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter then , it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant others liked the book , and that 's fine but i was disappointed
ok i loved the book and agreed with the basic premise that americans sure need to take a good look at their lifestyles the whole materialistic overconsumption thing is really disgusting once you recognize it i have read several books with this similar theme \( kalle laasen , naomi klein , travels of a t shirt in a global society , etc \) and the more i read the more stuff i eliminate from my life i do not think that all the kids are as bad as some of those out there think and not everyone is so pathetic and greedy as the book points out it is just better imagery to paint a portrait of an america that has lost itself in a self centered materialistic mire i have 4 kids who do not get everything they want they do chores they learn to behave and show respect and they work hard i know so many parents just like me and there are many very close neighbors in my neighborhood and others in my town there are block parties , people help eachother out \( not only after disasters either \) and life goes on no we do not live in some imaginary eutopia we live 0n the east coast we work jobs and save money for our childrens college etc i say all this because although i agree with the book that american culture as a whole is going down the tubes , i think there are many people who are living in america that are resisting this cultural downfall i do wish that this book could be required reading in schools ! ! ! sometimes it is difficult to get my teenagers to understand my rantings ! ! it is worth the effort and if each of my kids and all those other great kids out there can recongnize the games advertisers play and can resist the temptations toward overconsumption that is pushed on them then they will lead us into a fine future lets encourage the counter materialistic culture and pass the reading along ! !
i agree wholeheartedly with the excess and the overconsumption that is the main theme of this book i also agree with the lack of free time and the toll that working longer is having on our mental and physical health i am sick of the suburban sprawl around me and the rapid rate that every piece of green open space is getting concreted over overconsumption is killing us
this book is a fantastic collection of the effects and symptoms of greed and materialism it fails to address why these elements exist in the first place , it fails to address how the liberal ideology of the left in america are hypocrites by promoting this rampant materialism , and hypocritically denouncing it
every once in awhile , you come across a book that manages to strike a core and stick with you long after you 're finished reading it it really made me stop and think at how wasteful and materialistic my own life and habits have become i do n't entirely blame myself however , for i am simply another victim of this plague , a sickness that has completely taken over america and is far worse than the flu or common cold
this book is loaded with wisdom the lessons you will learn here can help you to take your life to the next level and then the level beyond that one study this book and its laws , and do not be afraid or too timid to adopt their teachings into your everyday experiences they will help you to get ahead , to get what you want , and to reach your goals
if you are looking for a feel good book , this is not it but if you are looking to understand how powerful people think and work , this will give you a glimpse into how they use others without moral judgements and prejudice , robert greene disects historical and literary examples of how people use other people for good or ill whether you are looking to use others or just avoid being used , this is good place to start the game of power unvarnished in all its ugliness

my son \( 34 \) is currently incarcerated he asked for this book so i had it sent to him he holds on to it for dear life and swears , had he read this years ago , it would have changed his life for the better and he would n't be where he 's at he raved so much , he insisted i order one for myself i did in summary , what i derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first otherwise , you 'll be no more than a stepping stone for others it 's a good book but i oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500 600 years fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son it 's a bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them
i thought this was an excellent book and it certainly describes how to achieve power but only to a limited extent in the final analysis you must actually know what you are doing and you must have the support of others every star sets just as it rises and anyone who thinks that they will never suffer reverses or need the support of others lives in the dream world described in this book all of these techniques are real and based on my experience and observation they work , but what is missing from this book is any word of caution at least machiavellie gives you some of the downsides , which this book lacks this is the law of the west and just like the old west , there is always a faster gun and the person who has practiced these techniques will find himself in real trouble when he meets that faster gun with over 30 years in the corporate world i know first hand that ruthless people get ruthless treatment and in the end all you have is your reputation and the support of those who believe in you if you use these techniques without regard for others or your reputation in the end it will cost you however , these techniques are real and they do work , but i think they should be applied sparingly
i found this book to be extremely entertaining , as well it offered little hints on how to operate more effectively in the concrete jungle of modern society some might view this book as some sort of evil manual on how to manipulate or control people , and they are right to a certain extent if that is how you choose to view this book on the other hand you can look at it as a book that can help you prepare for the inevitable challenges which you are going to be faced with , that is how i choose to view it in my opinion this book is like chemistry knowledge of chemistry can be used to make bombs and other horrible things or it can be used to help create many wonderful things which are too numerous to list here in the end it really depends what you do with this knowledge to sum it up i enjoyed this book and thought it was worth my time to purchase and read
this book is a no holds barred open discussion of raw power , entertainingly presented it took me a little while to get over the almost completely amoral tone of the book , but i eventually got the sense that the amoral tone is there for a purpose to clue you in to the fact that people who practice power at this level can often be completely amoral themselves in that sense , the book truly gives the reader a sense of the mindset of those who will do anything to stay in power there is a sense as one reviewer pointed out , that the book could have been written without this amoral tone , but then one would miss out on the opportunity of being immersed in its sense of amorality , which is an education in itself experiencing the amorality is a wakeup call that offers insight into how some of the world 's ills have come to pass , though you may find yourself wanting to shower afterward after reading it , you will definitely be more aware of the laws being played out on the world stage , and you will begin to recognize people in government who seem to be using it as a playbook some laws are even applicable in personal relationships a scary thought
i'm writing to refute a long , angry review i just read of this book the reviewer points out the evil of following these laws , and is angry that the book advocates them the book does not advocate these laws , it teaches them it 's a history lesson it 's not greene 's fault that these laws have been effectively put into effect for centuries by powerful people the book is an analysis of human behavior and social relations , not a book on ethics if it makes you angry , then it means you are literal minded , anti history , live in a dream world , and are completely wrapped up in yourself this book teaches you to be attentive to the social atmosphere that you live in if you ca n't do that , then you are anti social , anti powerful , anti seductive , anti intellectual , and a big bozo
this extraordinary book by frank rivers deserves more stars than would fit on this page frank rivers deals with ideas formerly reserved for mysticm and the most esoteric disciplines in a charmingly down to earth manner he gets a lot of mileage out of the owl analogy , and it works the reader , male or female , can easily identify with both the fledgling and the wise old owl of frank river 's examples this fascinating treatise on conflict , paradox and martial principle has so much more substance and clarity than one would expect from such a relatively unknown work i especially recommend it to readers who do n't normally enjoy warm and fuzzies , or self help conflict resolution type books i also recommend it to those struggling with the inconsistencies and injustices of life again and again frank rivers makes the principles of life , of reality and conflict , as concrete and usable as an idea or words on paper can get i plan to read this book several times in the next few years i put frank rivers the way of the owl right up there with james carse 's finite and infinite games and consider it much more accessible to the person with an average interest in this type of subject although i found the book deeply spiritual in nature , i also found it well in line with fundamental beliefs a baptist minister and a buddhist monk would both enjoy the insights frank rivers presents to the reader a great book for carrying around and reading at those odd moments
once i opened my first book by tan \( the opposite of fate \) , i could not stop reading joy luck club is a fascinating work it is full of humor and deep philosophic thoughts that reach in the middle of your heart , it is a great source of information about chinese culture , chinese immigration and what it is like to be born on the edge created by two cultures it makes you realize that the phenomenon of motherhood and daughterhood is international and yet every single couple of mother and daughter in the world is very special and different the book offers so much to the reader that it is hard to put a finger on what makes it rich its easy flowing and humorous style , its incredible depth , or the content that is full of adventures that are almost mistical
i loved this amy tan book , it 's an easy read and will have you drawn in right away to the story this series written by amy tan is easily digestable and enjoyable to read , sometimes it 's hard for me to engage a book but the books written by amy tan are so colorful and descriptive , it just draws me in and i ca n't stop reading this series is probably the best of it 's series , diasecting the mother daughter relationship on such a delicate and complicated subject , a chinese mother and an american born daughter who unknowingly lets the opportunity escape her to truly understand the intents and passions of her mother bridged by communication gaps and difference in language styles and a mother who might be troubled with dimentia , this mother daughter journey is plagued with mishaps and turmoil when june , the daughter , accepts new reason for her mother 's off key personality , june offers too little too late and soon she has too many loose strings of her mother 's past that she earlier dismissed as nonsense or retoric , to tie together to make sense june traces the pieces back to gain what her mother generously offered her in knowledge , but what becomes clear is the spirit of her mother lives inside of her as she comes to grips with who she is as a person and what her purpose in life is i loved this book and have read almost the entire amy tan series this book is the hinge of all amy tan books , read this and you 'll understand the others with new clarity ! loved it ! will read it again !
my mother was brought up very traditionally by my grandfather \( who was from china \) , whereas i had a western education and am currently living in the uk this book speaks to me almost every clash of culture written in the book between mother and daughter happened with me the language barriers , the difference in thinking i cried throughout the book and the movie because amy tan had managed to put all of it down so accurately
amy tan creates a small short plot that takes up about 10 20 pages the rest of the book is getting the reader very intimate with the characters and the situation of adapting to american life
if you are a man , you will not like this collection of feminist essays this book is worse than bad it is an abomination
i hardly ever cry when i read a book , but i did a couple of times when i read this one , just from the tender feelings and differences between mothers and daughters not only did these families have the usual difficulties due to age disparity between young and old , but there was also the cultural differences between war time china and the modern usa sometimes it was very funny , and it was always spellbinding to me it made me feel closer both to chinese people and to my mother and also my daughter , who 's the same age as the daughters in this book
i found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post immigrant fiction the chinese american experience is different from the jewish american experience or the irish american experience , but they also have a great deal in common tan successfully portrays the younger generation 's desire to conform to american ideals and the older generation 's often stubborn resistance to acculturation somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation

this book has quite deservedly collected very favorable reviews and i will not belabor the point i would like to add that i read this book shortly before a visit to burma nearly 2 years ago the insights gained , both political and cultural , were extremely helpful to me during the visit
i liked this book immensely on several levels as an anthropologist , i found it very interesting to get a padaung 's eye view , written in literate english , of his own background , his childhood in the remote , forested mountains of eastern burma the author tells of everything from the strictures of roman catholic missionaries in far parts of asia , to eating dogs , baby wasps , and snakes \( with relish \) , his grandmother 's stories , guardian spirits , a padaung funeral the burmese political climate of the 1960s and `70s merely lurks in the background until the author drops out of a seminary and heads to mandalay to attend university while information about various remote peoples is not uncommon , it is usually processed by foreign writers who have visited them flgg gives it to you from the horse 's mouth
this is an engrossing memoir detailed synchs with other things i have read of burma i kind of think some of it is a bit , um , self serving or fictional a story on steroids but , with that caveat , enjoy this book and keep it in your burma collection
this personal account of pascal khoo thwe 's life works for me on many levels i feel as if i understand what it is like to belong to a culture so different from my own his writing was deeply moving and so descriptive that i do believe i can feel and experience how his culture lived
culture and tradition , funny or deadly serious anecdote followed by a harrowing confrontation with burma 's brutal military regime characterize from the land of the green ghosts yet the story is told so gracefully that one feels eased into a life and death struggle rather than abruptly confronted by it \( as one might find with a western writer \) the advantage is that the author , the gifted pascal khoo thwe , can punctuate his narrative with a precise , violent detail heart stopping scenes appear neither moral nor immoral , only horrifying , a postcard from one of the most repressed countries in the world
extraordinary memoir by a gifted writer with an extremely unusual story to tell
i live in thailand and have traveled to burma \( sometimes called myanmar \) i was prepared to like this book and i was expecting the heroic life story that i got i was not , however , prepared for the beauty of the writing and the depth of the tragedy so simply , but touchingly , told it is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language thwe is very talented i hope that he keeps writing i also hope that in his next book , he drops some of the reserve that characterizes his cultural upbringing and lets us into his inner life a little more
this is a book that should be read by anyone interested in knowledge and its role in economic growth the gifts of athena historical origins of the knowledge economy , is a sweeping and comprehensive account of the period from 1760 \( in what mokyr calls the industrial enlightenment \) through the industrial revolution beginning roughly in 1820 and then continuing through the end of the 19th century the book \( and related expansions by mokyr available as separate pdfs on the internet \) should be considered as the definitive reference on this topic to date the book contains 40 pages of references to all of the leading papers and writers on diverse technologies from mining to manufacturing to health and the household the scope of subject coverage , granted mostly focused on western europe and america , is truly impressive
this is an interesting book devoted to the importance of knowledge in the formation of modern industrial economies mokyr has several goals the first and most important is to illuminate the origins of the modern industrial economy others are to illustrate the impact of modern economy , particularly its knowledge based elements , on modern life , to discuss barriers to the acquisition and dissemination of knew and useful knowledge , and to discuss differences in economic behavior between firms and households the quality of the book is somewhat uneven , possibly because this book is based on prior essays and lectures that mokyr has prepared in the last decade while the book certainly has a strong theme , the individual chapters do n't allows cohere
gifts of athena is an outstanding piece of work with profound consequences for research and policy its intellectual radiance will finally make the remaining shadows of conventional economic history fade into oblivion it guides the perplexed , reassures the convinced and guides the uninitiated
short , simple , and totally engaging just the thing to have with you on a trip , or to sit down with for a pleasant afternoon
i picked up this book after watching the movie a beautiful mind it 's a delightful , easy to read novel about an aspiring mathemetician who tries to get to know the truth about his eccentric mathemetician uncle the book details the uncle 's life long struggle to solve goldbach 's conjecture , which \( for you non mathemeticians , like me \) posits that every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes i felt like the novel showed a somewhat realistic perspective of a driven , obsessed scientist , and showed how the scientist 's activities and behaviors affected and even alienated those around him the protagonist is the only member of the mathemetician 's family who bothers to get to know and appreciate him and that is a struggle , as the mathemetician often does things to alienate his nephew do n't be put off by the math it 's actuallyq quite easy to read
one of the best books on the mathematical culture and the mathematical passion
i could n't put this book down and neither could my husband when he read it doxiadis' narrative style is strong the book unfolds much as a solving a mathematical problem would uncle petros emerges as a tragic figure , victim of classical hubris but earning our sympathy an excellent read by a talented writer
written by susan tabak , a 1 , 500 a day personal shopper , chic in paris is a stylish book that offers readers insidery information about the fashion philosophies of eight affluent , glamorous french women
a simple , predictable , yet powerful story of an old school pitcher , shaara 's novel is a classic baseball tale billy chapel , a future hall of famer who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club , decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves he is not interested in money \( yes , this is an obvious work of fiction \) , and pitches primarily for his love of the game
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels , and because i'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there
heard for love of the game by michael sahara ,
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book , it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it , even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion , i could be wrong
i ca n't review something you keep sending me when it 's the wrong bible you do n't have the one i ordered you do n't have the one that you have on your sight so you send me a diffront one the one i ordered was printed 2 3 1994 and you send a book printed in 2003
i 've had personal experience with bibles from numerous american publishers , and can attest to the fact that there is nothing amg , holman , nelson , zondervan , or tyndale can put out to equal the worksmanship of this edition those mass produced editions are made out of inferior materials , slapped together with glue that breaks down after exposure to moisture , and more often than not are impossible to read from any distance the only american bible i 've seen that compares to this is the thompson as published by b b kirkbride
some things you should know about the red letter cambridge kjv cameo bible
this cameo bible is one fantastic bible , made by a manufacturer that produces fine work the print is legible , the features are outstanding , especially the dictionary in the back , and the excellent concordance i also have the top of the line edition from allan 's of glasgow , which very much surpasses this calfskin edition cambridge leather bibles , in my opinion , are not of the same quality as they were 10 years ago they now tend to be stiff as the proverbial board it will last a lifetime no glue bound , cheap american mass produced garbage here this is a bible to carry wherever you go well worth the extra dollars you spend

this bible takes my breath away i 've searched and searched for this bible finally , finally , i found it it 's perfect in every way the size is just what i wanted it 's easy on the eyes oh , and the smell intoxicating everytime i open my bible to read it , i can smell the leather the pages are soft amp are not hard to break in at all i have many bibles and the pages are either torn or creased but , these pages are one of a kind i have the burgundy red letter edition amp it 's beautiful if you 're thinking about purchasing this bible , you wo n't be sorry i would have paid a lot more for a bible of this quality the best
i finally got my hands on the kjv cameo reference edition with concordance and dictionary black calfskin with zip thanks to the great people at amazon the only company i trust when buying on line they give great customer service bookshops here in the philippines do n't carry cambridge bibles so we have to order them abroad one of the first things you notice about the cameo cambrdige bible is the craftsmanship that went into its production the calfskin leather binding is indeed a joy to hold , supple but strong the type is so readable they seem to jump out of the pages of course nothing beats the cadence of the king james version of the holy bible , it is unsurpassed for devotional reading and inspiration mine has the zipper closure that will protect the gold edged pages for a very very long time the references , dictionary , concordance and maps make this handy sized bible a veritable treasure of bible helps as a pastor i own several bibles and versions , but none can compare with the quality of the cameo reference king james bible it may cost more than the regular bibles available here but hey they do n't make bibles like these anymore if the bible is the eternal word of god , does n't it make sense to purchase one that will last a lifetime
fantastic a book i would recommend to just about anyone to address some of the critics mentioned in the other reviews re dewey dogma \( 1 \) there is absolutely no pretense of an application of the scientific method , hence there can be no mis application \( 2 \) this book strikes me personally as one of the least dogmatic things i 've ever read in my life the ideas are fresh , original , and beautiful crafted and ordered \( 3 \) education is socialization an equation of broadly construed tions that results in a statement that one can neither agree nor disagree with
this book is one of the great milestones of american history and philosophy and particularly education it 's as relevant today as the day it was written a century ago
captivating illustrations celebrate the first year of baby 's life moments after birth , smiles and all the joyous experiences of discovery and accomplishment are revealed in sweet prose and illustrations on each breathtaking page this book will gently tug at the heartstrings of anyone who has ever loved a baby
a new approach which in fact is so easy but psychologically so difficult to accept we have tried it out and and observed companies doing it since 16 years to design and market low end products for the bottom of the pyramid \( bop \) with high profit margins at low cost we have developed a tool which we call mmp or multiple market positioning which shows step by step how to implement this bop idea successfully regards , dr peter oertli , oec oertli consulting , ch 8142 uitikon zurich , switzerland
tons of information backed by practical means there is a ton of contemporary and useful information , statistics , charts , and analysis in this book equally important are the lists
on the one hand this book is endorsed by microsoft 's bill gates and former secretary of state madeleine albright that ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value on the other hand , it might be asked , what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth \? after all , the poorest people that have any disposable income at all make something like two dollars a day
as prahalad explains in his preface , he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80 of humanity his approach would mobilize the resources , scale , and scope of multinational corporations \( mncs \) their investment capacity in a co creative partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations \( ngos \) in order to formulate and then implement unique solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than 2 a day at the bottom of the pyramid to which the book 's title refers the process must start with respect for bottom of pyramid consumers as individuals the process of co creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problem solvers new and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned that is a challenge
what is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth , improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models , distribution channels , product development or business processes having grown up and worked in india in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued
this is a well researched book in which prahalad explores how disruptive innovation if harnessed properly can lead to huge profits for the corporations involved and high impact social well being the key however is to get the ground breaking idea there is no set approach to getting the same , but he has done a good job of explaining how the idea can be scaled
this is a fantastic book ! 112 pages of theory and advice that really makes sense you easily internalize the message ! this is then followed by 5 very thorough and down to the detailed examples of how the theory has been practised by fore running companies in the field of 3rd world integration it is very illustrative and initiate thoughts on how this could be followed up in your own compan
i have read every book in the tempe brennan series this is another excellent novel this is one of my favorite suspense series i eagerly await each new installment
break no bones is a fast paced exciting novel that will keep you up at night to finish it ! murder , greed , love , relationships it has it all ! forensic descriptions are very graphic , so not for the squeemish but you will gain knowledge of this field from a true professional kathy reichs
a great novel however ms reichs should get someone to check her botany being very familar with francis marion natl forset and a biologist there is no way that one would find cool loving hemlock instaed ther are cypress , tupelo , pine , oaks , pines etc but no hemlocks in francis marion nf it would be found in the mountains
kathy 's books are my favorites , and i will always rush out to buy anything she writes
the only complaint i have is the main character always seems in pain ! it is tiring ! and confusing , the reader is to be drawn by her strength but she is always in a constant romantic quandry and nursing wounds otherwise the storyline was strong and interesting authors description of charleston was vivid and i loved it
when temperance takes over on an archeological dig on a small island off the carolina 's , her thoughts center on her relationships , her nearly divorced husband and her tentative relationship with her boyfriend as confusion reigns supreme in her personal life , professionally she is about to face another challenge involving what appears to be a series of similar murders is there a serial murderer loose on the island \? as she gets closer to the truth , her life and those around her are in imminent danger can she protect those she loves and will the resulting circumstances change everything she feels to be right
an official library weekly book review
this book , was very well organized easy to understand and apply , i ordered three books and this was the best of all three
thomas j lucier managed to put together an amazing and resourceful book i bought it , read it and loved it and now want to read it again
great book of wisdom most importantly usable well written , no details left out on exactly how to do each step you can tell thomas has been there , done that unimagineable amount of professional resources that comes with the book
i purchased this book some 6 8 months ago and i have used it and the resourses provided by thomas on a daily basis i am a nurse and i am looking to retire int he nxt couple of years you cannot buy another book on the market that provide the informaiton and resources that this book provides i give it a 5 rating
i opened my new real estate investment business from home , the week after i finished reading this book i honestly feel 100 confident in pursuing pre foreclosure deals , because of mr lucier 's book now , when i go to the county records department in my pre foreclosure 's county and confirm my online research findings to this particular pre foreclosure i'm pursuing , i have actual forms to fill in with very important data that i need to make a good final decision , about the foreclosure , thanks to mr lucier 's book after thoroughly reading this book , i feel like i know the secret codes to buried treasure and no one else does people are going to ask me , how did you get so knowledgeable and successful in pre foreclosures \? this book is my answer and i'm keeping it all to myself thank you mr lacier for writing this book , i look forward to the next one
this is a concise no bullspit book on pre foreclosers if you are curious to find out whether or not real estate is for you , or a serious investor , this book will seriously assist you in making decisions it is a complete kit for the serious investor , yet a reality check for those who are not to sure about investing into real estate for the amount that it cost to find out , it is worth the time to read it and the cash lay out to buy it
after reading this book , i felt like i had a better grasp about foreclosures and the real estate market as a whole
foreclosure investing is all the rage nowadays , but thomas lucier tells you why you must get in during the pre foreclosure phase to really make the big bucks there 's just too much competition for properties once they reach foreclosure
this book is great i read the reviews and they were all true ! ! ! the author 's language is clear and simple the books gives you all the forms , checklist , pros and cons on the foreclosing homes , dos and dont 's and for the price , you ca n't go wrong , even if you just get it for the forms and list of websites and reference he gives in the books , it is worth it
in 1903 charles ponzi arrived in the usa with the aim of becoming as wealthy as rockefeller his modus operandi was based on the principle of robbing peter to pay paul
some books may not be particularly recent publications but deserve renewed attention and ongoing recommendation in light of modern events or contemporary concerns james walsh 's you ca n't cheat an honest man how ponzi schemes and pyramid frauds work and why they 're more common than ever is one of them , focusing on how pyramid frauds work , why they 're common , and how to avoid scams and cons the scheme name may change but the scheme is the same it involves case studies in greed and exploitation , outlined in you ca n't cheat an honest man so that investors may learn from the woes of the 'taken' as relevant today as it was in 1998
if you 've ever wondered how pyramid schemes get started and how they unravel , this book makes an interesting read you will be both amazed and appalled at the mass stupidity involved in getting these schemes off the ground however , you might feel a little foolish yourself when the author points out that our very own social security system is a textbook ponzi scheme
insightful , well documented , and very powerful ! this book is a wonderful primer on the type of society the nazis created , the lengths that they went to control their people , and the measures used to create the 3rd reich
do you like your history light or full strength with nothing taken out \? if you want to skim through yet another book about the nazis that tells you something you probably already knew but in a different way then do n't bother with this book however , if you want to read first class , detailed historical writing then this is certainly the book for you evans makes 1930s germany come alive how does he do it \? by using historical records and documents to recount incidents involving `ordinary' people he recalls appalling things that happened to people no different to his readers he recounts cases of `ordinary' people doing unspeakable things to their fellow germans the reader is brought back 70 years and is really made to feel \( as much as is possible now \) what it must have been like to live in an all embracing dictatorship the author forces you to ask yourself the uncomfortable question , would i have behaved differently \? you 'll have guessed by now that this book does not make for easy reading this is exactly the way it should be you probably wo n't pack this book the next time you 're going on a sun holiday however , if you want to read a book that actually tells you something new then this is the book for you evans makes no concessions to readers who do n't like too much , `boring' details and who are only interested in the `big picture' this book describes in detail how the nazis mercilessly quashed all opposition , controlled every element of german society , remilitarised at breakneck speed and remorsely drove germany into a second world war this is full strength , full fat , nothing taken out history thank god for that
most people with an interest in history probably think they know quite a bit about hitler 's germany this book reveals quite a bit of new information and fills in the details in a picture more often described in broad brush strokes the writing can be quite dry , and may contain too much detail \( figures \) for some readers but it is generally a readable yet credible book
this book is the second in a planned three book series about the nazis , and it covers the time period from hitler 's ascension to office and the invasion of poland in a very lucid fashion , the author explains how the nazis in power changed the face of germany we are given culture , arts , politics , religion , the family , and other subjects , and can readily observe how germany was transformed , for the worse , by the nazi party it is a chilling tale of a people that allowed themselves to be seduced by propaganda , and even though the book shows that not eveyone was happy with the government , things just went along because hitler appeared to be able to accomplish almost anything he wished once again , we see how the reluctance of the western countries enabled him to accomplish what should not have been possible it 's a morality tale for our time , because it seems that now most of the world justs sits by while iran works on a nuclear option , and hopes that things will just turn out all right in the end reluctance to confront evil is no option any more , as this book very well shows
professor evans is writing a comprehensive three volume history of hitler 's germany , with this the middle book the scope of the undertaking is daunting to the casual reader , with many topics taken to extreme lengths for example , how average german citizens were organized for holidays and relaxation in the 1930s takes up many pages however , a good book for the person with keen interest in the political , economic and social life of germany in the critical years preceding ww ii
still a highly readable , fact filled work on the nazi 's in power from 1933 39 the book is not chronological rather , evans breaks up the chapters to deal with individual topics at times , this was frustrating because you may lose what else was going on at that time until 200 pages later on the other hand , it was also good because it allowed the reader to focus on individual topics and learn more and more about them the best details were the mini biographies that evans wrote about several key figures during this time these were very informative and easy to read another great part was the details on the strength through joy program this write up was very fascinating the last chapters on hitler 's attempts to prepare for war and acquire areas such as austria was very well written and interesting as well i would have given this book 5 stars based on sheer information , but i only give it 4 because some chapters were not all that interesting and the non chronological aspect got in the way at times still , despite any negatives , the readability , research , and information is well worth the price and the time it takes to read a book this massive even the most well read student of wwii and or nazi germany will find some interesting information in this book
evan 's third reich in power falls just short of being a great book i would rate it a 9 if amazon had a ten point rating system evans concentrates on the period between the elevation of hitler to the chancellorship and the german invasion of poland in 1939 evans uses what might be called the mosiac method he examines most of the essential features in which nazism attempted to regulate and direct the lives of the german people , and does so in succcessive chapters this is an interesting approach rather unusual for contemporary history , and is reminiscent of that taken in , say , cambridge 's ancient history and medieval history series no grant theses emerge , but several themes suggest themselves
this is the second volume of a 3 volume history of the third reich as with the first volume , this is a substantial work of synthesis of the enormous literature about the third reich evans has aimed at producing a work that can be read usefully by scholars and by the general reading public evans has largely succeeded by producing a massively documented and very well written book evans has also made the book more accessible by avoiding a strictly chronological approach he covers a series of topics related to the social and economic history of the reich and concludes with foreign policy and the outbreak of war reflecting his prior research interests , the sections on the social history and structure of the third reich are excellent the final section , covering foreign policy and diplomacy , is less thorough , though this is a twice told tale several unifying features emerge one is the nazi intent to reshape german , indeed european , society along the lines envisioned by their peculiar social darwinist ideals the second is the success of the nazi state in 'coordinating' almost all the institutions of german life with their ideology a third is the primacy of hitler 's decisions a final is the obsessive goal of an aggressive war to conquer eastern europe , which often distorted other nazi social and economic policies on completion , this trilogy will be a standard reference work for this period
a highly detailed coverage of the third reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in germany during the 1930 decade overall i would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to world war ii
eric schlosser performs a great service with his well composed description of the industrial food system that feeds most americans
i bought this book for a book club \( and cursed the woman that chose this as her favorite book \) , and from the moment i started reading , i could n't put it down it 's fascinating , well written , and makes you feel a little bit smarter for having read it
it does n't matter what your diet is , you should still know how food stuff gets made in america i have intentionally not eaten hamburgers or hot dogs made outside of the home before this book and do n't intend to have anything with ground beef that i have n't ground up myself this book was n't as graphic as i expected \( yes , i am disappointed \) i have heard stories about cereal factories and tomato sauce plants so i know that basically rats are everywhere and unwrapped on the food network wo n't be showing you that stuff
there is a movie set to release for this wonderful book i have no clue about the movie , but books are always better this is a very easy read for non ficton learn the history of the french fry and not in a good way learn about how things have changed in food sizes in fast food and how it has contributed to obesity of america this goes into details about someother issues of corporations like walt disney and the destruction of public transportation for cars it all fits together if you want to know about corporations and the history of how things got to be the way that they now read this
if you like fact reading , you 'll like this i thought he was to discriptive and went on and on and on about nonsense some of the info was really good , but it was hard to stay focused and really take it all in i found my mind wondering and thinking about other things
eric schlosser 's fast food nation is a thorough if somewhat slanted analysis of the fast food industry the author hooks the reader early with sweeping invectives against the titans of fast food before you can say supersize me , you 've learned that ray kroc and his cronies are responsible for the homogenization of global culture , the spread of e coli and other deadly pathogens , the obesity of america 's children , and the exploitation of the unskilled masses take a deep breath that 's just the intro
the author brings a high level of professionalism to his story about the growth of the fast food industry and the consequences of its ruthless pursuit of profits
even a few years after it 's release , eric schlosser 's fast food nation still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies not a purveyor of good food or nutritious food for that matter
why are americans so fat \? according to this clown , it 's because of fast food which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves , our laziness , and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline gee , i wish mommy government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions ! then everything would be right with the world after all , no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them right \? people should n't have to make decisions for themselves ! it 's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what 's best for ourselves someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the internet
even if you do n't purchase or eat fast food , the buying power of the industry still influences what you purchase at your local supermarket agribusiness is a multi billion dollar industry , more soulless and corporatized than ever before money is the name of the game , from soda makers to additive manufacturers , and the price we are paying is our health
i am a ph d student working on my dissertation in case study research this book is right on target for academic researchers using a case study approach if you do n't know anything about the process , you need this book if you think you already know this process , you need this book
this book is so interesting on so many different levels it talks about people who are autistic and the way their brains work differently from non autistic people and it talks about the similarities in the ways that autistic people and animals brains work and process information written by an autistic woman who fills the text with lots of first hand experience she really helped me to understand animals on a whole new level i'm not much of a reader of non fiction , but this book is so interesting you 'll learn a lot i would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying something new very good and worth the money
outstanding ! easy to read and full of valuable information on how your pet \( or other animal \) actually thinks and sees the world around it it is also full of valuable , real world examples of how to handle this and also full of valuable insight into people and how we think temple grandin , the author , is autistic \( although relatively high level functioning \) and she sees the world differently than you and i see it she also believes that is how animals see the world i do n't agree with the extremes she believes , but i think she is on to something and there is a lot to be learned from her she certainly has plenty of examples of instances where her point of view produced the results the animal handlers were looking for in any case
about a year and a half ago , one of our two small dogs rejected her crate the crate was a small metal cage that she would sleep in at night for the first five years of her life she had been happy , even eager , to get in at night but suddenly , it seemed that the very thought of the cage terrified her she would spend the entire night throwing herself against the sides , hitting the door with her paw , and scratching the plastic tray that was the bottom piece in an attempt to dig her way out about this time my wife very wisely left for sweden for several weeks , and after ten days without sleep i capitulated and let the dog stay out of the cage at night
this book was someone else 's bookclub selection , and i think having no expectations when i picked it up really helped in my having that wow experience that some folks report with this book and others miss yes , the prose needed much better editing overuse of repetition , stock phrases , and hanging assertions that should have been cleaned up however , i found the discussions of brain development evolution , similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors , development of language in different animals , and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating \( oops , just gave away the ending ! \) i found the side discussion of outcome based audits interesting and enlightening i also liked dr temple 's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions great idea ! although the book really goes all over the place , i found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my seeking hunting motivation \( you 'll have to read the book for that one \) , and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold
people that recommended this book said i would be wowwed after reading each page , but i have n't been to date i'm only about 1 4 of the way into the book and find it very interesting and easy to read temple grandin explains infromation in a common language so there 's no hard thinking to do great for my lazy days at the beach
the first sentence in the book is people who are n't autistic always ask me about the moment i realized i could understand the way animals think
honestly , i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive the author 's main point , although interesting , seems to me like it would fit into an essay also , the particular print of the book that i purchased , has a dog on the cover , i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior instead , i felt i little duped most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments theories or anedoctal accounts of my friend 's dog fido , one day did this i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population i mean , the author does n't even have a dog ! ! i suspect that i , who have had a lifelong history with dogs , have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author
this little book written to provide insight into the myriad of pynchon 's obscure references and symbolic appellations in the crying of lot 49 is a worthwhile source of help if used with discretion and common sense although many of grant 's entries are useful to untangle some of pynchon 's more obscure references , others will simply lead you further down the path of confusion the problem lies in the fact that while many of grant 's suggestions are useful , others simply bring about the same type of confusion that he is trying to address , since he often gives more than one possible explanation for each passage discussed that is not to say that the book is not useful , it is , only that the crying of lot 49 by its very nature resists such means of explanation but as reader of pynchon already know , any help is welcome as long as the reader keeps in mind that this book is meant only to introduce possible meanings and complimentary facts , which may or may not correspond to what pynchon actually has hidden in his words nonetheless a good source of info and a help to anyone exasperated by the twisting and turning of pynchon 's view of the postmodern world
here 's the key to uncracking the crying of lot 49 i used the book while i was reading pynchon 's novel while in a high school leterary club with the novel 's complexities , i never would have been able to understand the book with out this helpful companion the book follows the novel in chapters pointing out everything that you may have missed much of what was pointed out i did infact miss never thinking pynchon might have been using an illusion or just not understanding what the illusion was this book is a must
i conduct the berkeley pynchon reading group , berkeley pynheads i can say , without reservation , that kerry 's book is absolutely essential for gaining access to the crying of lot 49 as a bonus , it is an endlessly fascinating read in itself it is like an encyclopedia of american arcana buy it
this book is a must for anyone who has read or is reading the crying of lot 49 and is somewhat confused by the allusions and references pynchon makes throughout the book from facts about thurn and taxis to an entry explaining who ringo star is \( just in case you did n't know already \) , it is a wonderful reader to put amongst the pynchon section of your bookshelf
as others have stated , it definitely lives up to it 's title , and i passed on the first try not by a wide margin , mind you , but it 's title is not how to pass by a landslide on the first try , is it \?
fresh off passing my pmp on the first try by reading only this book and the pmbok
i would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about passing the pmp exam it is written in simple plain english and covers topics in detail i gained lot of value by reading this book and it helped me pass pmp at first attempt
i have more than 15 years of project management experience i 've read this and quite a few other pmp books from cover to cover most of the reviews on this page sound like a propaganda to me this book gives you the impression that it 's a big book and must be covering lots of material but this , in my opinion , is not true it 's big due to the large font and because most of the space on each page is empty
i used this book along with two others i took the exam before purchasing this book , and i did not pass , but after using this book , i passed with flying colors the author organizes the material clearly and explains things very well i wish i had purchased this book the first time !
the book is very clear and helps the end user understand all the terms the online tutorial is good too however it needed more situational examples
the book is very well organized , very useful , and good exercises the best in this area strongly recommend it
i passed the pmp test on my first try on september 25th 2006 my preparation material
i took no pmp exam study classes at all using only this book , one commercial practice test , and about two months of evening study , i took the pmp exam and passed it handily on my first try if you 've looked at pmbok 3rd ed , you know that it 's designed as a reference , not a learning tool crowe 's book provides the same information in a study format in addition , it covers the numerous topics that are on the pmp exam , but are not in pmbok the real test had its hard questions , but none that were a total surprise after reading this book thanks , mr crowe
i purchased this book after reading lot of good reviews on amazon my study plan was to read this book and pmbok thoroughly and take the test three weeks before taking the exam , i took the 200 questions 4hrs at the end of book and got 92 the same day i read some comments about false sense of security one may have after reading this book i read some reviews where candidates recommended the rita 's book i immediately purchase rita 's book and read it thoroughly so my primary book was andy 's and secondary book was rita 's this strategy paid off very well in almost 80 questions on exam day , i found myself referring to the andy 's book rita helped me in other 20 this 20 is a lot and can be a deciding factor in your success bottom line is get the both books i can never stress enough on this read andy 'd first make it primary and then rita 's you will feel confident and hopefully do well in exam i never touched the pmbok except during the training for 35 contact hrs
really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
it was n't my favorite crichton story , but it was definately entertaining and suspensful ! plus , the sneak peek of state of fear in the back of the book was a good bonus too
the andromeda strain may be an antique in science fiction , having been published in 1969 , but that hardly diminishes its excellence the caliber of michael crichton 's research is such that i still found the technology and science in the book impressive \( though the computers were obviously dated \) despite the book 's age the plotline is thrilling , and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy , most are equally fascinating i was slightly disappointed by the ending however , the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it
the andromeda strain tells the story of a bacteria growth in piedmont , arizona this bacteria kills people in a matter of seconds and killed everyone in the town except for a 69 year old man and a baby a top secret commission is formed to see how these bacteria kill people and to see how they can be stopped
the andromeda strain is a story about a virus that was exposed to a small town in arizona , piedmont piedmont was a desolate ton to begin with , and only got worse after a strange and unknown virus took the lives of all the citizens , save two this is when the story begins to get juicy these two survivors , a small child and an old man , are then transferred to a maximum security laboratory in nevada from here a team of scientists work toward investigating the virus
even though i disagree with allison 's interpretation of kant , he spells everything out clearly this book was a help to an undergraduate course i took on kant
henry allison is quite rightly regarded as a legendary kant scholar , and his service in countering the dominant anglo american criticisms of kant is noble indeed this remains a very important book after so many years i am only sorry that he spent so much time dealing with arguments that are often unworthy of consideration for students wending their way through the thickets of the kant literature , this book simply must be studied with care
allison announces in his first sentence of his preface that this , the 2nd edition of a book originally published in 1983 is substantially revised , and so it is , especially the last half of it it was an important work of scholarship 23 years ago , and a revision after so much time during which he has remained a teacher and scholar specializing in kant , was bound to excite broad interest it must have gone far toward gaining for him the prestigious prize of 30 , 000 he was awarded last year \( 2005 \) for outstanding kantian scholarship
allison 's masterful and now classic work brings back the long ignored importance of the notion of intuition into kant scholarship allison sees that only by beginning with intuition can the totality of kant 's epistemology be properly framed allison 's work is a colossal advancement in the literature \( see also allison 's earlier the kant eberhard controvery
henry allison has become one of the world 's best living kant scholars , and kti is his best work with kantian epistemology becoming more and more important , not to mention controversial , many of kant 's critics have got in the habit of smashing down straw man versions of kant \( often without even realizing it \) here however , allison weaves together a stunning interpretation and defense of kant 's transcendental idealism that leaves little room for those wanting to flail away at poorer constructions for anyone who loves kant this is the book for you , and for those who do n't this is one of the most important books you 'll ever read because it really lets you know what you 're up against
henry allison uses his book as a companion to kant 's critique of pure reason in his courses on that work at boston university , and well he should the book is dense and written for the serious student or scholar of kant , but it is very accessible and useful to both each chapter deals with a specific problem of kantian idealism , moving from analysis of kant 's presentation , through the interpretations that populate the literature on the first critique , and finishing with allison 's own defense of kant 's argument \( or , in some cases , what he takes kant 's argument to be \) perhaps the most important contribution allison makes to scholarship on the critique with this book is his treatment of kant 's work and his idealism as a whole , and his persistence in keeping that whole in view even while dissecting the minutiae of kant 's arguments the treatment of kantian idealism as a doctrine lends allison 's defense a plausibility importantly lacking in such piecemeal accounts of the critique 's immense , sophisticated , and intricate argument as the almost useless cambridge companion to kant the discriminating reader will find that allison 's defense is not always on target he sometimes disappointingly defends kant from himself beyond our own ability to sympathize but kant 's transcendental idealism succeeds despite this sentimentality
the honest truth \( or , more accurately , reactionary bias \) does not sound as much against homosexuality as he does unsafe sexual behavior , which many , many gay men do not engage in heterosexuals do a lot of stupid stuff too , but we do not blame heterosexuality , we blame the self destructive behavior what ht fails to explain in his review is this how do you account for all the gay men out there \( myself included , hello \) who are not promiscuous and risk taking in their personal lives \? i 'd like to here the honest truth about that ! oh , and by the way , what makes straight people always think they 're such authorities on gays and lesbians \? if you want to find a real expert , look no further than an actual gay person what a concept
i got this book for my birthday one year after finding it on the shelf at a bookstore being a part of the minority group of gay christians , i was intrigued the target audience for the book is for homosexuals and their loved ones , but it really could be read by anyone , and i think it should be mcneill offers theology on living in fear , guilt , shame , anger , and living with pathological faith and the importance of maturing spiritually i think any christian can relate to any \( if not all \) of these topics , and not just struggling gay christians it 's the kind of book that you may want to read with a pencil or pen in your hand so you can underline parts that are important to you \( that 's what i did \) this is a caring , humble , and comforting book , and one that i highly recommend and cherish
richard i of england 's charisma reaches out and grabs us 800 years later he is the epitome of the chivalrous medieval knight but richard 's behavior toward his wife , queen berengaria , reveals a cold , callus aspect of his personality
i am a huge fan of historical novels unfortunately i am often disappointed by writers who drone on and on about historical facts , and do n't exhibit one ounce of creative talent rachel bard 's queen without a country was captivating i absolutely could not put it down until i read through the entire book in one sitting for me , bard has redefined historical fiction and i will forever use her book as a guide to judge the rest by
kings and queens of past times usually seem so remote , but berengaria comes across as a genuine person that i felt i might have known i could feel her joy and her trepidation , and sympathize with her heartbreaking rejections the book convincingly portrays life in medieval france among those of high degree queen without a country held my interest from beginning to end
ibn fadlan is a diplomat , not a warrior his mission was to represent his people and make contact with other civilizations on their behalf but it became so much more
if you 've ever seen the great movie \( thirteenth warrior \) that was based on this book , eaters of the dead will just not measure up maybe the structure of the book was the problem crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document maybe he was too successful with that conceit it was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension , character development or an elevated literary style unfortunately , those qualities are necessary in a novel this was mostly a bore do n't bother
so i 've got a bookstore , and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up so why is it that i see so many positive reviews here \? myself , i thought the authentic feel was a definite plus , \( much of the time i did feel that i was reading an ancient memoir \) but as for being a page turner , as somebody else called it , you 've got to be joking this book is one of the slowest novels i 've ever read i did it on audio book and i kept falling asleep it was a lot like sitting in driver 's ed after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus creighton has written some pretty fun stuff , some of it even mildly thought provoking , but his is neither timeline and the two jurassic park books fit well into the whole roller coaster of a book thing , and personally i thought sphere was great
i stumbled upon the 13th warrior eaters of the dead while browsing in a seaside used bookstore i was quickly immersed in the narrative it 's very different from the typical crichton more historical fiction fantasy than sci fi and even his style is different , mimicking the choppy cadences of translated arabic the story , in which a islamic ambassador from baghdad finds himself traveling with a viking crew to rescue its people from an ancient menace , is enthralling crichton , with typical attention to detail , embellishes his tale with academic footnotes , blurring the line between fact and fiction for even the most attentive reader \( yours truly included \) i was tickled to find at the end that crichton 's story is based upon beowulf \( which i have to read for school this summer \) buliwyf is beowulf , rothgar is hrothgar , etc i loved the story , but loved the ideas behind it even more through fiction , crichton attempts to imagine a historic basis for the beowulf saga , much as heinrich schliemann found a real troy in his search for the truth in the iliad fascinating and thought provoking the hallmarks of a crichton story
eaters of the dead by michael crichton is a very entertaining read this book has the page turning ability of all of crichton 's other books however , this book does not have the scientific background that some of his other books do
when i saw the 13th warrior is the theater , i was struck by the number of similarities it had to beowulf i did n't realize until a few years later that was the point of the movie nor did i realize then it was based on a novel by michael crichton
when i started reading this i only had the vaguest inclination of what the beowulf story really was it had everything i 'd want in a story , strange characters , interesting plot , and it evoked such emotions as excitement , dread , and repulsion i found this translation particularly interesting though because of the footnotes the entire thing is riddled with footnotes explaining possible variations of words , different explanations and theories , etc
first released in 1976 , 'eaters of the dead' was one of my first michael crichton books i have been an avid crichton fan since that time later , in the 1990 's , a film was made called 'the 13th warrior' , which remained true to the book and yet added some wonderful flavor and fantastic visuals to a novel i still remembered as terrific though based heavily on the rediscovered manuscripts and references of the real ibn fadlan , crichton clearly tells us the book is considered as fiction and was is marketed as fiction
this novel is actually one of crichton 's better creations crichton tries to write the events of the epic poem beowulf in a believeable manner and for a man who has made the eventual rise of dinosaurs believable to we skeptics \( no tropical savanna locked in glacial ice necessary \) , he pulls this stunt off as well he presents the information from the perspective of ibn fadlan , an emmissary from babylon with footnotes and such \( and the fact that ibn fadlan was a real travel historian \) , the book is confusing until you realize that almost all of it is entirely made up
i did n't read this book for the truth , or the lie , but just to read it ! it was an amazing story , whether or not it 's true was irrevelant in my eyes james frey is an amazing author putting all the drama aside about everything that went on , i really and truly enjoyed this book
i think if you 've lived life under a rock , watched a lot of soap operas , and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas , this book will appeal to you
i 've done some investigating on this book and james frey as an author when he first started looking for a publisher to publish a million little pieces , we titled it as a non fiction work , and was turned down for years he finally put the title of biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher
this is a book written from the heart filled with deep soul searching and honesty i'm familiar with alcohol and drug addiction i'm familiar with treatment centers for those of you who know this road this book touches home for those of you who do n't do n't be the first to throw that proverbial 'stone' i 've heard the reports of the 'untruths' regarding this publication i read it anyway pain is an immense ocean the depth of that ocean is different for each of us this 'message' could be a gift for many a starting point , a different way of looking at life and it 's unkind lessons this book offers an open hand to start you on a journey towards reality toward clarity for those of you who belittled this book be it truth or sensationalism be cautious ! you never know what life holds for you or yours around the next bend the information offered here , the idea of taking that 'first step towards recovery' , the process of becoming honest with yourself and others , could well be the salvation for someone you love yep , it 's got some rough language did you really expect anything else from a drug addict \? common ! gimme' a break ! get real with yourself ! keep an open mind and dig into this book ! it 's a good read !
i have always wondered what happens in a treatment center how do people stop being an addict \? what do they do all day \? what kind of people are in a treatment center \? this book answers those questions and shows that there 's hope for every addict i think it 's an excellent read a gift to all addicts it 's exiting , i could n't put it down and i thought about it quit a lot
i 'd heard the buzz \( both pro and con \) and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book
it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read i read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about the writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read i ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over i know this is supposed to be for emphasis , but i just found it indulgent the lack of correct punctuation was distracting , too had i read this when the book first came out , before everyone knew he lied , i would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of aa although i have not attended aa or any similar support groups , i feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions , that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own , which in most cases i am sure they are not i found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than james frey , and i ca n't say that i felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself but i am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he is n't feeling so badly anymore
if you can get past the scandal that revolves around this book and actually read it , you will not be disappointed this is a must read for anyone who has been touched one way or another by a drug or alcohol addiction
my mother has introduced numerous authors to me , and i am glad that she has she has introduced to me to classics , to modern day litature , and some crud books i learned what to pick from her i know what to read when she introduced this book to me , i had no prior knowledge about the author , james frey for all i knew , it was a drug book after my mother had finished it , she gave it to me to read i was skeptical about it i felt that i could not read it , because it did n't sound intresting it was a story of a man that defines rock bottom he wakes up on a plane , covered in body fluids , and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it he is then taken to a rehababilitation facility , where he detoxs and thinks about life he then meets love and finds himself there it is a uplifting story
the reviews all sounded so good i could n't resist i was hoping for another memoirs of a geisha but boy , was i disappointed the story bounces all over the place , never seems to have a consistent theme and finally , turns out to be just plain boring i 'll give the author some credit the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in asia myself , i enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era unfortunately , the budding story of a war hero 's longing for a very young girl \( he refers to her as the changeling \) made the guy come off looking like a pedophile seriously , pretentious readers will love this drivel too bad i ca n't recover the hours i wasted on this schlock with any luck , it 'll be another 20 years before 'ol shirley picks up her pen again
read this novel for the exquisitely crafted prose the sentences are understated , spare , austere , yet luscious unfortunately , the story itself is skeletal and the main characters with the exception of aldred leith thinly sketched also , all the characters think and speak in the same spare , luscious voice which is perhaps believable for a war veteran of 33 , but hardly for a 17 year old girl and her teenage brother no matter how precocious they may be , teenagers do n't have enough life experience to utter the wise sayings these munchkins do
this book was so boring i could barely stand it in fact , i had to abandon ship halfway through the main character is kind of interesting , as are the two kids , but the story itself is so slow paced that the characters ca n't carry the book i am a huge reader and i can count on one hand the times i 've had to quit a book midway , but this one just could n't hold my interest i found myself daydreaming everytime i tried to read it the writing was over the top the author sounds as if she 's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess , but do n't believe them one of the worst books i 've ever read
no , this is not the da vinci code or john grisham 's the firm but here 's the good news i enjoyed both the da vinci code and the firm , and i loved the great fire you do n't need to be a snob to enjoy this book it 's a great story with great characters but you 're more likely to enjoy it if you really love writing \( not just a good story , but also how language is used to get the story across \) it is true that you will be challenged at times when i started reading the book , i had the feeling that i did n't really know what was going on or who was who hazzard 's style is not very linear but in time everything starts making perfect sense , and you ca n't help being fascinated by the extraordinary command of the english prose that hazzard has with one sentence she can convey a place , a time , a feeling , an emotion in a way that you 'll think you 're there and it 's happening to you i believe she 's one of the most talented writers i have ever encountered , and i 've read a lot i recommend this book to anyone who truly loves both great fiction and the english language
some books , in my opinion , are just plain overrated the characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting likewise the tale the reader takes nothing from it put this in a list with franzen 's the corrections and frazier 's cold mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades
the only great thing about the great fire is its name
this is such a waste of talent it was only published because shiley hazzard has written a better book the story was dull , the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable what kind of people would ignore their children this way \? depressing and a waste of time
shirley hazzard writes beautifully choreographed stories that gently and carefully blossom like a flower it is n't a book for everyone because it is definitely controlled in how it reveals itself and for some it initially may feel slow if you do stick with it hazzard will present some pearls of writing she writes what might be on the surface very simple stories but her real knack lays in creating some of the most lush and acute metaphors and analogies about the human condition i have ever run across i found myself writing down sentences and turns of phrases that were tossed off a bit lightly but hit the spot i came across her work when reading an interview that had been done with her and it gave a keen glimpse into her writing as i was reading the book this book in particular made me think of carson mccullers and truman capote in the sense that they too wrote calculated stories that only the reader in as much as they thought was reasonable at a given time not everything is given away on the page but you can always feel how complex the emotions of the characters are fantastic book
shirley hazzard must have considered every word in every sentence each possible meaning for every one some of the lines are absolute gems with a myriad of meanings depending on how you focus on possible significances she writes with such beauty it takes your breath away so much is unsaid yet understood finally , you need a good plot to have a good book , and this one is a satisfying in every way the characters grow and change then fulfill the roles they have adopted for themselves in a believable manner gorgeous book
the principles in this book have been very helpful what it says is true in my experiecne too unless we work to change from the inside and recognize our true potential we will bnever reach that potential what we think and imagine is what we create a great , easy read in spite of some really deep principles joe has a great writing style
i just recently picked up this book and cannot put it down ! if you want to go about manifesting the life of your dreams , in all areas , then pick this book up
it has been effortlessly easy to share and refer joe vitale 's book to everyone very personal and enjoyable read with key points on how to
although there are a lot of similarities between this book and other self help books out there , like setting goals , knowing what you want , etc , this book goes over the spiritual side to getting what you want it gives an alternative approach to other success type books which i thought was interesting and enjoyable to read
i thoroughly enjoyed this book ! although there is nothing new in it , especially if you have read books on similar topics , joe organizes the material in a systematic and usable way that is easy to follow just read the book and follow the steps ! i did and within 2 weeks i had a new car ! everything he says in this book is true just open your mind to the possibilities and see what happens
this book should be read by everyone on the planet it is the tool to assist in bringing about the mind shift for our next leap in evolution
joe got it across to me in one sentence i believe our planet is what was described in an original star trek episode called shore leave they kirk , spock et al are on a planet that reads their thoughts and creates what they think about now , if you 're not familiar with the concept that your internal world creates your external world , that 's an 'out there' idea yes , parts of the book are redundant and i'm not into all the spiritual stuff but that 's okay , because the concepts are simple and simply explained not to mention uplifting and inspiring i love it i 've read it twice in a year now , and enjoyed it both times thanks joe
the attractor factor gives you much more than just a simple formula for acheiving success in your life whatever you want out of life , whether it is love , wealth or fame , it requires an effort on your part and a paradigm shift in your thoughts and beliefs because so many people have negative beliefs \( whether they realize it or not \) they attract negative manifestations into their lives by changing your thoughts and beliefs , your actions and the resulting manifestations will follow
i am happy with the speedy mailing of the book as i got it much earlier than anticipate
moran 's way path through phenomenology is truly phenomenal ! i say that it is a way path and not a work because it is not an end in itself , but truly the beginning of an ever continuing renewing end it has been extremely helpful as i work my way through phenomenology
the oxford dictionary of allusions is limited in content i would have preferred something more complete
no one likes difficult conversations , but we must have them this book guides you in dealing positively with these situations and conversations to make the best possible outcome
this is a must read for anyone involved in communications with your boss , your colleagues , your clients , your suppliers , your spouse or partner , your kids , your friends \( have i missed anyone out \? \)
have you ever had a challenging conversation with a spouse , co worker , friend , or family member that did n't turn out so well \? did you ever wonder how to best deal with a significant person in your life without causing stress when needing to approach a topic \? the authors give great advise to handle most conversations that might otherwise cause stress
ever dread having to hold a difficult conversation \? i recommend this book for as basic training for anyone who has faced the prospect of speaking with bosses , co workers , employees about negative workplace behaviors , skill deficits , attitude issues , interpersonal conflicts , or blind spots
each time i read difficult conversations , i learn something new that is practical a must read for anyone looking to improve their understanding of family , friends and others
i'm writing this review of the 5 cd audiobook , not the book the cd is a must have , whether you 've read the book or not in it , actual examples are acted out of all kinds of conversations before and after the techniques are used after listening to the cd i can easily recall what to do when i find myself suddenly in a difficult conversation , because i 've actually heard it also , as you move through the sessions , the authors go just a bit deeper and deeper until one finds oneself admitting some very personal truths i think the reviewer below who recommends dale carnegie instead did n't hear the cds i did n't get the same result from dale 's books , as i have from listening to these cds the ultimate result of having listened to the series a few times \? i do n't get thrown off balance \( their term \) so often when i suddenly realize the other person is reacting negatively to what i thought was positive , and vice versa i just switch into a different mode and many times , the person \( either me or my companion \) has forgotten they were upset at all
i recently spent almost 300 of my own hard earned cash to buy this book from amazon and mail my friends their own copies yep , it 's that good
this is an excellent resource for talking about difficult topics , especially in areas that are highly charged e g in family life or in a couple
despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon , i really cant appreciate the value , usefulness or practicality of this book the proposed framework , that each difficult conversation is really three \( the what happened \? , the feelings and the identity \) conversations , is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem you may think i am a contrarian or a poor communicator however , with my very positive experience \( and reviews \) on books like how to win friends and influence people \? by dale calegie , get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again by david j lieberman , how to talk to anyone \? by leil lowndes and so on , i am obliged to warn potential buyers , in particular regular readers of relevant books , of a big disappointment
douglas stone demonstrates great awareness of the subject matter he states the principles and then illustrates them with powerful examples he made me think of my own approach in difficult conversations the person who buys this book will not regret the purchase
a beautiful book , excellent for a gift as well as for one 's own library the illustrations are many , varied , and lovely the text is engrossing
i 've found myself coming back to this book time and time again , just to open at random i would recommend this book without hesitation
i found this book in the gift shop of the point reyes national seashore visitor center on a recent trip to inverness and had to own it
wonderful book amazing pictures what a treasur

this book is a sumptuous , lusciously illustrated homage to birds of all sorts common and exotic it is printed on rich , delicately tintured stock , which frames the splendid artwork that accompanies each contribution it is composed of poems , meditations , folklore , sagas , journal notes , involving birds , from people who 've been inspired or irritated by them the artwork includes famous audubon watercolours , oils , aboriginal renditions in sculpture or stone paintings , statuary , mobiles and all sorts of depictions

inane , useless information from a speaker so boring i could hardly get through the 3 cd 's \( but felt like i had to since i had spent the money on them \) perhaps he is a great salesperson but i cannot see it i bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box i think this information was aimed at someone in grade school , not a professional sales person
this is a great book most of the stuff that tony robbins teaches in his 300 influence programs has the same exact tenants that ziglar teaches ziglar is the best teacher for success principles , period i have studied in depth brian tracy , anthony robbins , earl nightingale , jim rohn , and anyone else of note in this field ziglar is the best all around earl did start it all with lead the field and that may be the best condensed program out there but zig is the best today tony and tracy are 5 star speakers also
this book helps to keep your chin up sometimes in sales it can be discouraging you can only take so many `no 's this is a useful tool to help you get on top and stay there ziglar is an incredible teacher
the content is full of valuable information on selling but this audio cd is not my favourite
on page 190 mr ziglar shares a very profound point of view theoretically , the odds are in your favor because very few consumers read books , attend classe , or listen to recordings on how not to buy i have been reading his books and listening to his tapes for years and this book , to me , is a history book in sales he shares his sales experiences and solutions when he sold with small companies , and gives examples of some of the sharpest salesmen in the country who sold large orders for some of the biggest corporations in america one of the main points he brings out throughout the book is a a f t o want to know what it means \? get the book
i would encourage you to listen and listen again to a wounderful explaination of what being a salesperson is all about if you are looking for a sales career or just want to reinforce what you already know , this wonderful cd is what its all about in fact , it 's a dream come ture for most this cd is a real look into what it takes to nurture a positive aditude about getting ahead and staying on top , not only in sales but in your life thank you zig ziglar
this book is an outstanding guide for the art teacher eager to teach not only creative photography , but how to connect , understand , and tell a story through a picture this book teaches expression through exercises with video and poetry , how to read a photograph , to have children from different cultures learn from each other from self portrait exercises in the shoes of different ethnicities
this book guides you through teaching literacy through photography to children , for which ms ewald is well known it is a fantastic resource for someone who wants to really teach the heart and soul of photography , as well as visual literacy a great introduction to photography but even a seasoned photographer can learn something new from this book ms ewald takes you through her curriculum step by step as she would teach her students and gives you the tools and tips to pass it on this is not a technical how to photo book , there are plenty of those out there , this book is truly a gem i have used ms ewald 's book as the basis for my own workshops with children and i now have adults asking me to take the course ! i ca n't say enough great things about it
i read this book because of the good reviews by the end of the book
i agree with fuzzy ear 's review below the characters are quite average , so in a positive way a reader could easily relate while it was a quick read , it was dull at times
i read this book in a day it was a fun , light book interesting insights into evangelical christians \( and the mormons next door with a trampoline very funny ! \) the story was engaging and well written the character of alison seemed very realistic the book could have been longer the writing was so entertaining , i would have loved to continue reading about alison and her life
i think some of the negative reviews here do n't get it that you can have a deep , thought provoking subplot going on , that deals with deep rooted things like religion i was raised in amish country \( though i'm not amish , but i 've been scarred by the evangelicals , too \) and i have thought a lot about all the things that the author writes about it 's a great story that focuses on other areas besides just the ditsy chick lit normal stuff not that those things are bad this just had more substance highly recommended
i read this book in a single sitting and wish i could re read it every day reading it for the first time was like putting on a cozy , warm jacket that you forgot you still had a gem
this is the story of alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he 's had an affair with for months this story was so disappointing it 's like dunn took the same ideas as jennifer weiner 's good in bed , i e being dumped , religion , pregnancy , friends , etc , but the end result is disappointing the heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an evangelical christian \( who cares \? \) , how she slept with few men , etc this story is not realistic , it 's not that funny , and the heroin is disappointing if you want the real thing , read jennifer weiner , but not dunn , sorry
this book is not great , really not great it is decent , but not nearly what i was expecting the cover says that it is a highlight reel from sex and the city , one of my very favorite shows , but it was so opposite of satc , that i ca n't even understand the comparison the main character does n't live in nyc , and does n't write a column about sex , but does write a column it 's about a girl , one who hates her evangelical christian background , so she has sex with a couple guys , but it is n't about loving the man , it 's about wanting not to be a christian i finished it to find out what ends up happening , but i was really dissapointed do n't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you do n't hate evangelical christians
as someone who vascilates between reading rushdie and chick lit , i really enjoyed this book it 's definitely a step above marian keyes , etc but still light , easy reading sarah dunn is insightful and funny , i look forward to reading her next novel
this nifty little volume is proof that the english language is not only alive , it 's kicking butt and taking names language junkies are familiar with the author 's several dozen books and probably his website and maillist , too \( for which he slips in a couple of plugs , but that 's okay \) what he 's interesting in here is the invention \( or the organic rise , perhaps \) of new words by all parts of society , from teen slang that mostly lasts two weeks to techie terms that have rooted themselves firmly in the wider culture , like dot com or the verb to google he avoids stunt words \( deliberate cleverness by some writer \) and nonce words \( which appear only once and die immediately \) none of his examples existed before c 1980 , and all have established a track record by appearing in a variety of public media \( he 's aware of sniglets , incidently , but points out that not one of those introduced by rich hall has actually entered the language \) some new words are so obvious and so apt once you 've heard them , you ca n't believe no one ever thought of them before \( he describes s j perelman 's delight when a mechanic told him his car had been totaled \) the chapters are organized by source or context modern angst , modern politics and war , activism of all flavors , political correctness \( itself an apt and sneering recent invention \) , advertising , the internet revolution , pop psychology , baby boom ism , privacy and security \( not to forget 9 11 , now an overused shorthand \) , and even dilbert he gives examples of usage from the media , too , some of which are a hoot still , there are gaps in the language for which no word has yet appeared , like a reasonable term for each other by adults who regularly go on dates \( boyfriend and girlfriend are a bit silly when you 're over forty \) this book is a great time sink \( that 's in here , too \) , both fun and informative
this is my newest book out and i hope you take a look at it unlike a lot of grooming books , this one is the most conprehensive when it comes to grooming your dog whether it 's training your dog to accept grooming , handling bad hair days , getting your dog ready for the show ring , or dealing with medical conditions or real hair emergencies , this book handles it all in a friendly , fun and conversational tone
i learn so much from these books have about6 different ones the index in this is the best to look up anything you want to know about taking care good care of your dog
i really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series if you are a fan of dean koontz you will not be disappointed i give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in , but well worth the wait whew , what a ride
this character is a very unlikely hero a total geek , who is absolutley likeable the story fast paced and well written this was my first koontz book and it will not be my last i'm actually reading forever odd and that too is very good read this book
for me , this was one of starters of dean koontz 's books i really liked the book dean koontz is my favorite writers , cause of him i am doing my own book pick this one up , really good characters , main character , really good story , and plot
i did n't know what to expect before reading this book , but after reading it , i recommend it to any and everyone one of the best i 've read of koontz , and i 've read quite a few
this book , even though it is fiction , with true history mixed in for good measure was very inspiring ! everyone i had listen to it , loved it ! i would like to thank the author and say it was well written , and the narrator read the words beautifully ! thanks again
i tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time i did n't give it a chance i could n't read anymore after the second decision it 's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it it 's the same old self help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse i feel cheated that i paid 1 29 for it at the thrift store
this book covers all the ingredients for one to be successful andy andrews covers all things that have been said before one way or another , but his rendition is both educational and motivating his unique style makes it a must for anyone seeking harmony within themselves for a happier , more fulfilling life
read the traveler's gift by andy andrews , a self help
after seeing his video , the seven decisions , i had to have the book it is entirely different , but with the same message i then bought three to give as gifts andy is a great story teller , and very entertaining i highly recommend this book , and you 'll want to get another one to share \( keep your own \)
i bought this book based on the blurbs , and the fact that i enjoy an occasional steven covey type read
i really enjoyed the traveller 's gift which was recommended to me by one of my very successful friends i am a huge student trainer of personal development information , and what i liked most about this book was it 's freshness
not normally a fan of self improvement stuff , i was referred to andy andrews as a way to help coach my staff listening to the book on tape , i found myself drawn into the story and wanting to re listen to the messages the characters resonate with reality and there were many passages that were directly reflective of my own life and experiences
this book is an enjoyable story to read it encompasses imagination , vision and direction to making changes for your life i felt it was a great way to learn about important lessons we can understand at any age to live successfully ! i recommend this book to anyone that is looking for happiness and success in their business and personal lives
if this is one of those books that some physcology teacher assigns you to read for a later book report , forget it put the book back and drop the class it 's just doesnt fall into that kind of catagory this book is an extension of that old saying you make you 're own bed , so sleep in it if you 're not a deep thinker and do n't consider spirituality \( i do n't neccessarily mean religion , so chill \) anything more than a magic act , then do n't bother picking andys book up its not you or for you having said all that , i liked it it had some solid words \( the 7 decisions thing \) to live by that are not anything more than you already know in your own gut he just brings it all to the surface a bit so you can digest the meaning and perhaps try it yourself i cant call it a self help book i 've read several of those and most of them get thrown out with last nites pizza box this is a simple , short page turner that you could knock out in a couple of evenings no big words or long speeches but dont read it that quick do a couple of chapters then put it down for a day or two
i have never encountered a more brilliant historian just when i thought life would n't brighten up , i found this incredible masterpiece
drama city is not your traditional mystery , nor is it exactly noir , although the subject matter is definitely dark it does have an original lead character , an ex drug trafficker named lorenzo brown who takes a job as an investigator for the humane society when he gets out of jail
while the plotline is routine and almost predictable , pelecanos makes it work i love his characters both lorenzo , the ex con trying to go straight , and rachel , the parole officer trying to get straight , are very likeable and sympathetic characters their depth carries you through a less than moving plotline i will be reading more of pelecanos' work
an ex felon turned humane society worker trying not to get sucked back into the violence around him and parole officer rachel lopez who has a dark night life are the compelling characters of the great george pelicano 's new book when a murderous gang member cuts loose the 2 find themselves caught in the middle gripping , surprising and also compassionate full of pelicano 's usual great use of street slang and authentic details about music , cars and animals if you 're a longtime pelicanos reader you 'll notice it does n't include his usual characters but these new characters are a welcome addition to pelicanos' urban jungle
after loads of success with his earlier series , pelecanos introduces two new protagonists in this excellent trip down washington , d c 's mean streets his work on the hbo series the wire , shows in the main character of lorenzo , a drug crew thug recently off an eight year stretch of jail after a third strike now he 's trying to put the game behind him and live a square life as an enforcement officer for the city 's humane society part of lorenzo 's routine involves reporting to his parole officer , the young , attractive rachel lopez given the d c area 's substantial latino population , it 's taken pelecanos a while to introduce one as a major character , but with rachel he not only takes care of that , but has finally written a fully developed female character she 's not without her own issues , as alcoholism and anonymous sex threaten to lead her somewhere dark
i have read all of his books and he seems to me to be getting better and better
i really enjoyed this novel it was a welcome surprise to see how unusual this is it 's not a standard crime novel the lead character is n't a cop or detective or private eye it would probably more approprately be considered urban noir
this book and some of the other books from the design briefs series , have become an integral part of my working resource library ellen lupton 's book has been one that i have used over and over again i often reference it when i am faced with a blank page that i am having a hard time laying out
please if anyone ever needs a type book , this one is perfect it is a helpful wonderful book
worth reading if you need to learn more about type , layout grids , and popular fonts of the past decade
this book is possibly the best design education text i 've seen everything is kept simple , and clear ellen lupton 's categorizing of typeface styles , for example , is logical and all inclusive , yet still a simple breakdown of the vast variety of typefaces she is easier to understand than robert bringhurst in the elements of typographic style , something crucial to any budding designer this book will serve you well
i was inspired by some of the samples of type usage in the book from the first few pages ellen lupton , the author of design culture now , came up with a book to fill a void where it was much needed it is hard not to encounter useful elements in it to both , help you enhance existing designs or tackle new territory
i bought this book because other customers loved it and because it was not expensive it was so much better than i expected i was expecting to pick it up and just visually browse then leave it for later but read all the content the first day i had it even reread parts incase i missed anything i plan to use this with 17 18year olds within a design programme as it is consise yet interesting so book is great value for money , practical advise offered is clearly presented and taught to the reader through its design ! visual content and extra information is compelling quirky humourous relevant , overview of typographic evolution intereting and fonts useful loved the material used for the tables ! check it out
thinking with type is a must have for graphic designers and typography lovers even if you think you know everything there is to know about type , you 'll learn something or at the very least be entertained by the witty prose and examples
this book is well presented , reads well and is an elegant and useful tool for anyone who has anything to do with type as a professional designer , i enjoyed reviewing what i knew and found a number of things that were helpful in my everyday work i count this among my favorite references
the book was brand new , and arrived in a very timely manner thanks
this book is useful and straight forward it is an excellent book for students
in this collection of essays , nancy fraser makes equally strong political and scholarly contributions arguing that postsocialism leaves the left lacking in utopian vision , she begins by attempting to formulate such a vision rather than choosing to focus on the goal of recognition or that of redistribution \( put another way , on cultural or social issues \) , she argues that any effective leftist politics must work for both simultaneously throughout the book she maintains this balance between cultural and social concerns and strategies for change the result is both politically inspiring and intellectually stimulating
i was reccommended to read planet of the blind due to my interest in writing stories about people who had disabilities and about by own disablility for i'm visually impaired myself and i have an interest in writing so i read steven kuusisto 's book planet of the blind and found it very facinating and inspiring ! i highly reccomend it ! i 'd love to know what is he doing now and is he still writing and speaking of the book
i read stephen 's book late into the night and then got up and read more in the morning the book not only brought me new understanding of the world of blindness , it spoke intimately of the journey of self acceptance stephen 's story is threaded through with grace , and his language is musical a deeply spiritual memoir you will finish it changed
this is one of the best books i have ever read that captures the experience of visual impairment it is beautifully written and very evocative it will move those who are not visually impaired as well
steve kuusisto gives a moving description of growing up with visual impairments and how he learned both to live with his disability and turn it from any kind of hindrance into motivation his writing is poetic and realistic while a little hard to read at the outset , in part because the story is sometimes painful , following steve as he learns to accept the help of others and then establish personal independance is a lesson in perseverance and self growth i strongly recommend it as an inspirational , educational and literary work
this book has so many great accounting best practices it should serve as a goal for every company it is an invaluable reference guide to anyone who is just starting a business , or needing to improve the efficiency of their accounting functions
the historic quaintness of its grammar informs me and often makes me titter while reminding me of my birthright no home should be without a copy no matter who the reader or their diction
the idiomatic use of the english language needs a referee , and some referees are simply better than others the anything goes motto of our times gives us uneven , illiterate , and occasionally brutal prose this book helps block this inevitable slide into the lack of clarity and coherence this second edition \( cf , third edition \) of modern english usage may strike some readers as arcane and archaic , because it is so restrictive in its prescriptions given the laxity of many our writers , the use of a strict disciplinarian in philology is a welcome resource
fowler 's should be on the desk of everyone who writes not only are his explanations clear , many are so witty that the reader laughs out loud this important book should be more than a resource it should be picked up , flipped through , and read at random for the sheer enjoyment of fowler 's infectious love and knowledge of language there is always something new to be learned , and you may come under the spell of the beauty and precision of the english language when used deftly
as all the other reviews are positive , i will add a much needed critical perspective
so often , we tend to think of the near extinction of the bison as having been solely caused by overhunting by the fur trade this book shows the intensely interwoven cause and effect relationships that led to massive changes , not only for the bison , but for the native americans as well the scope of this book is so much larger than just the destruction of the bison it addresses the full range of effects that westward expansion had on the plains to gain a better understanding of the ecological dynamics at play between the bison , the indigenous tribes , the settlers and the environment this book is a must
andrew isenberg presents an array of complex and systemic causes that brought about the near extinction of the north american bison the author 's breadth of knowledge related to the bison demise is incredible the reader is not bored with endless details behind these knowledge blocks , however rather , in fairly short order , the reader understands how climatology , geography , economics , sociology , migration and immigration , policy , and anthropology all played a role in the bison 's destruction and while the author presents an incredibily well researched description of the bison 's destruction , along the way , the reader learns volumes about how native americans lived , changed their lifestyles , and were linked to the bison the reference listings are impressive for those needing further information and authentication anyone interested in how the american plains were settled and shaped , this is an enjoyable read for the researcher , this book is a gold mine
andrew isenberg provides a complete overview of the near demise of the american bison in late 19th century the author 's principle theme is an explanation of the causes for the near extinction of the largest north american mammal in the largest north american biome isenberg provides an extensive description of how the reintroduction of horses to north america uprooted many native american peoples of the plains and exaggerated their dependence on the bison this increased dependence on bison was further fueled by the fur hide trade of the early 19th century the near death note to the american bison was provided by the east 's increased need of leather component 's for it 's expanding industry and desire by the euro american populace to displace bison dependent native americans if you are interested in complex cause effect senarios in american history this book is a must the book has been extensively researched and provides an awesome reference list
this is a heavyweight tome with clear insight every manager should read this
this book is just great i find it a straightforward and no frills book yet reading it makes business interesting and encouraging a truly indispensable reference and guide to management , better than any textbook i have come across in terms of giving clarity to the big picture for that i have huge respect and admiration for peter drucker
this is the book on how to make a business work ! i am president of a small company and immediately took the ideas and practices out of this book and applied them to great success this is not a quick read , and every item will not pertain to each individual person , but the observations presented explained a huge number of obstacles i was facing if you are trying to manage any form of modern organization , buy this book and spend the time reading it it made me a huge drucker fan
i bought it for a friend who is trying to train her young dog i do n't know if she has read it yet she has not told me
i felt this was a good book that had a lot of good ideas in it however , the book was filled with a lot of nonsense type things that i felt really just made the book longer and less enjoyable i ended up skimming a lot of the stuff a lot of the book talked about nutrition and how that affects behavior i just felt it was too much info for a dog training book i would recommend it though because it was reasonably priced and did tell me what i wanted to knw
i have been a trainer for many years , and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist and i can tell you that paul owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training this book is an average \( at best \) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other \( professional \) dog trainers behaviorists i 've read many , many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing if you 're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do check out any of stanley coren 's books \( he has many \) if you 're looking for training techniques take a class honestly , there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes \( with a respectable and knowledgable trainer \) where they can be properly socialized and trained if your dog is having serious behavior issues consult a professional animal behaviorist your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody good luck !
we tried all the tricks from bribes to choke chains and paul owen 's method really works not only is my dog happier with me for teaching her usng a kind method , i am happier too because my dog really listens to me this book is the best
sorry , but i'm just not a fan of clicker training or the concept of waiting around ho hum until your dog happens to do something that you want it to do granted , there is some helpful advice given within the pages of this book , but i'm very glad i did n't pay regular retail for it \( yay , amazon !
this book helps you understand the dog and why it does what it does , and how to motivate it to be socially acceptable and good company
nope this book does not advocate complete physical exhaustion and manipulation as a way to control your wants to take over the planet \( or at least your house \) dog
paul owens gives a fun way to train your dog using treats and positive reinforcement our four month old beagle is learning to sit , stay , lay down and other good skills paul recommends cooked chicken \( unseasoned \) or cheddar cheese as motivational treats used during training other treats are recommended in his book and dvd
note that this video has nothing to do with cesar millan 's television show on the national geographic channel called the dog whisperer
i read cesar millan 's book and thought that this bood would be similiar in information and instruction i was completely wrong i skimmed over every section because each section was so basic the teaching method is completely different from millan 's and therefore a complete waste of money
for any reader who has thoroughly enjoyed the gabaldon crosstitch outlander series and could n't help but adore and admire lord john grey then i put to you that this is a lovely sideline novel keeping us linked with all of the characters and history that we miss once finishing a breath of snow and ashes anxiously awaiting gabaldon 's new additions to this wonderful set of beautifully written historical novels
diana 's other novels i have read and re read , getting blissfully lost in them each time but this was did n't fit with the others a little too earthy for my tastes
gabaldon has built a huge fanbase on her outlander series which spans literary genres from romance to science fiction to just about everything in between lord john gray is a minor character in the seris , and never one of my favorites when i heard that gabaldon had written a mystery novel in which he takes center stage i read it more out of a sense of loyalty to the author than a genuine sense of interest in the character i was surprised by how enjoyable i found it obviously the book is musch smaller in scope and size than the outlander books \( which average about 1000 pages each \) but gabaldon establishes lord john as a highly sympathetic caharacter in his own right , and tells a story almost completely separate from the series on which she made her name naturally this is jarring to readers initially , but going into the book with an open mind and no expectations yields rewards from a skilled novelis
i had loved the outlander books and i felt a sense of loss when i finished them natually , the next step was to get the lord john book even though it 's unrelated to the outlander books , i thought it would be just as engrossing and entertaining i was very dissappointed the story was not that interesting and the characters were not very well developed or likable i read the book to the end , but i really could n't care less how it ended or what happened to these people i would not recommend this book to anyone
when i first bought the book , i did n't think it could be just as good as the outlander series , since i adore them and it had n't any of those character the john grey book amazed me with its mystery , alway had me on the edge of my seat i devoured it in 2 days , i could n't put it down
i was very disappointed with gabaldon 's previous book , the fiery cross , and had a hard time getting through it it did n't feel fun , exciting or sexy , as her previous books had but i picked up this new book anyway and am very glad that i did it was a fast read , did n't get bogged down , had enjoyable and interesting characters ca n't wait to get the next book in the lord john series highly recommend
time travel , romance , and historical details from 18th century scotland to the beginnings of the american colonies who could ask for more from the outlander series \? we did and got it lord john and the private matter is also a hot gay historical novel that takes place in the time series as well
i was n't quite sure what to expect when i began to read this book i had not really warmed to lord john in the outlander series , but i like gabaldon 's writing style , so thought this might be an interesting read for a short story by gabaldon \( less than 400 pages \) , this was pleasantly entertaining
although this book was published in 1944 , the same year as hayek 's the road to serfdom , it remains as relevant as ever some say that it is dated and it is true that many of the historical references are not the ones that would spring to mind today , but the critique of the myth of the self regulating free market remains as relevant and to the point as ever one of the main targets of his book was the vienna school of economics , the central figures of which were ludwig von mises and f a hayek what polanyi does is help one to see how hopelessly na ve and ahistorical many of their central assumptions are though one might question some of the details of polanyi 's thesis , especially regarding the gold standard the causes of the two world wars , he makes two incredibly powerful arguments about the myth of the self regulating market to which proponents of that theory have offered no convincing reply more of this is a second
polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant , radical , and all too plausible theory in this book
polanyi challenges the neoclassical \( specifically hayekian \) assertion that humans started out as individuals , and only later grew into societies siding with durkheim and other holists , polanyi argues that the concept of a freely contracting economic individual is actually a very recent , and very sociohistorically localized , assertion put simply , free markets are something consciously made and supported by societies , not an a priori order nor a state of nature polanyi beautifully weaves legal , economic , political , and social history into a cogent thread of argument one does n't have to oppose free markets upon accepting polanyi 's argument one just has to become aware of markets' socially constructed and supported nature
this is undoubtedly polanyi 's finest work , and an example of the highest quality of scholarship available this analysis of the rise and influence of the socially embedded market is simultaneously lucid and profound clear and complex detailed and sweeping it provides one with a wonderful model for an interdiscipinary approach to the investigation of social phenomena it is employs political , economic and sociological concepts within a genuinely historical framework to reveal truths about our modern industrial society that no single discipline could fathom it is , in short , a masterpiece
polanyi 's classic is one of the most cogent treatments of the rise of market society ever written , and shows that conceptions of historical dynamics often cover over the fact that it is people who decide how to create the rules of economies , there is nothing inevitable about them this account shows another picture of nineteenth century economic history leading into the twentieth that revisionist history would often wish to forget a great and enduring work
the author of this book outlines the history of the theory of risk in the last 450 years and its modern metamorphosis into risk management the reading is fascinating , giving many historical tales and anecdotes that one could only obtain from time consuming consultation of many different documents or books the author confuses skepticism with cynicism at times , especially when discussing the relation between modern financial engineering and risk management , but in general the dialog is pleasant to read , and offers many different insights into the different viewpoints of risk this is especially true for the discussion of 'prospect theory' as first proposed by daniel kahneman and amos tversky and its elaboration of risk averse behavior readers sympathetic with prospect theory will find its inclusion refreshing , although it would have been even more helpful to such a reader to find a discussion of the relation between prospect theory and its expression , if any , in modern risk management
we are used to calculating odds to make decisions on a daily basis , whether it relates to betting at poker or horses , deciding what the traffic is going to be like on different roads en route to work , etc this is a great analysis of how we have arrived at our current state , with a particular interest on how to calculate risk this book is very succinct , and does not dwell unnecessarily on particular topics but moves forward in a most agreeable manner this written in a historical manner , and i believe will appeal most to those that want to have a better understanding of how to analyse risk and or the historical underpinning of our current state of knowledge
against the gods the remarkable story of risk , is a world class history of ingenious ways to measure probability author peter l bernstein approaches the subject of risk uncertainty with patience and unfolds a stirring tale of how civilization dicovered ways to improve the understanding of probability
for people who are interested in the economic side of risk \( mainly stock \) , rather than the probabilities and risks of every day things
must confess my bias on this i like games , gambling and investing this book covers the gamut and does it well what i found especially enjoyable was bernstein 's literate background he spun a fascinating tale of 'the remarkable story of risk' \( from the front cover \) in a totally engaging way
bernstein writes with the depth of knowledge of a university professor , and the style of popular fiction writer he captures both the scientific and human aspects of this broad subject
against the gods is a fantastic book for people who love to read the history of risk , dating back as far as to the greeks bernstein 's passion to the topic makes it a clear 5 star book and he 's passions shows on almost every page example if you are just interested in the markowitz formula , do n't buy this book but if you wanna read that markowitz 's methodology is a synthesis of the ideas of pascal , de moivre , bayes , laplace , guass , galton , daniel bernoulli \( especially since he 's had the same nationality than me \) and von neumann morgenstern furthermore , that markowitz 's methodolgy draws on probability theory , on sampling , on the bell curve and dispersion around the mean , on regression to the mean , and on utility theory if this history is what interests you , this book is for you \( if not only for the great title book cover \)
this is an excellent book on the history and development of the concepts surrounding and the measurements of risk
crisp reading , articulate , gives an exacting history of math and the pursuit of managing risk through the use of math since the beginning of time
this is an extremely comprehensive guide to classical music by over 500 composers and provides authoritative recommendations on the various performances of their works that are available on record for each composer there is detailed information about their life and a critical analysis of their work so this is both a biographical dictionary and a guide to recorded music the articles are well written in an accessible style and the book is attractively produced highly recommended for the classical music lover
i am not a professional music critic or player , but just like and listen to classical music a lot this book is to me the a better guide than penguin or grammophone
this is a fascinating buying guide to classical music recordings with many positive attributes it is full of interesting historical context of the composers and their works and fascinating performer trivia , making it quite entertaining and educational in addition to comparing the many recording choices compared to penguin or gramophone , it gives much more in depth backgroung on each work 's history and significance also , there is a lack of any british bias \( since published in usa \) that some cite with gramophone or penguin \( both uk published \) case in point american pianist , garrick ohlsson 's superb eight volumes of chopin on the arabesque label third ear is the only guide to extensively review each of ohlsson 's arabesque cd 's while there is not one mention in the 2003 penguin or gramophone bias \? perhaps more likely the brits are just not familiar with all the musicians across the pond its really impossible for any one guide to be the end all guide
an outstanding achievement i 've always appreciated the penguin and gramophone guides , but this book beats them , hands down i enjoy the no nonsense , irreverant tone the various writers call it the way they see it , and i do n't pick up the industry commercial bias that i sometimes do with penguin and gramophone i'm impressed that this book still lists the laserlight mozart cds by vegh and the salzburg camerata academica that are such fantastic bargains the writers also pull no punches when it comes to naxos , whereas penguin and gramophone tend to gush from time to time wordsworth 's mozart is criticized while wit 's tchaikovsky is praised quite a revelation added bonus the listing of quality christmas and noel music in the back section chapters i will keep turning to this book in the months ahead i hope they do rock and jazz in a similar fashion , soon
in its 1 , 201 pages , this book expresses maybe 25 , 000 opinions and its unavoidable omissions silently state uncountable thousands more so even a near dilettante like myself will have no trouble carping over some of them but when it takes a position significantly outside the consensus , it usually says so up front and you wo n't have to waste any mental energy deciding how much of an adjustment to make for penguin 's notorious britannia rules the audio waves bias but most decisively for me , it 's simply a great deal more enjoyable to peruse part of that is the cleaner layout , but mostly it 's the writing concise , informative , and frank
third ear competes indirectly with penguin guide in the field music criticism but is limited by having only one person review an entire composer or a selection of a composer 's genre so , unlike penguin guide , the reader only gets the opinion of a single person \( along with now deceased editor alexander morin \) instead of the combined opinion of the three authors of penguin guide otherwise the book fares well against its more established competitor among third ear 's greatest value it contains music often not found in penguin guide it usually contains multiple listings of music deemed unsuitable for the british publication , such as beethoven 's wellington 's victory another example is its review of the burgeoning recordings of crusell 's three clarinet concertos , where third ear offers a far more comprehensive view than even the 2003 04 edition of penguin guide but there are serious drawbacks in this publication , too for reasons that could never be explained , third ear dedicates less than two pages to the entire output of anton bruckner , whose nine symphonies have been recorded many times since middle 20th century this is a criminal oversight that cannot be forgiven , especially since third ear dedicates almost a page to every one of gustav mahler 's symphonies , the composer most akin to bruckner i should grade this book down an entire star for this hideous omission , but i wo n't since i 've found it countless times to be an exciting and interesting volume most of the authors are known to veteran collectors and many are current or former contributors to american record guide , including the late , esteemed editor and harold c schonberg , who wrote the foreward both the late messrs morin and schonberg were estimable critics who never sought to turn a sow 's ear into a silk purse when discussing a record , cd or live performance while the one reviewer to a section mandate of this book can be limiting not to mention the way it projects the the biases of a reviewer \( see the comments on roger norrington 's beethoven symphonies a critic calls one spew \) it is not enough to deny the greatness and value of this book to record collectors third ear joins the penguin guide , rough guide to classical music and now deleted insider 's guide to classical recordings by jim svejda to offer buyers information on the many choices available on amazon com and elsewhere in the wonderful world of classical music
this book comes in direct comparison with the famous penguin guide in my view , it is better than the penguin guide in its coverage of recordings made on smaller labels , and its style of prose is more readable than the cut and paste style of the penguin guide on the other hand , the penguin is more evenly balanced beetween composers \( another reviewer mentions the poor coverage of bruckner a few errors here and there too , e g mixing up the czech and slovak republics a couple of times alltogether this book represents a fresh and very comprehensive view , with many surprising and innnovative recommendations
this book needs to be used with caution there is no mention of gunter wand 's recordings of beethoven symphonies and mackerras 's life enhancing cycle of mozart symphonies is simply dismissed because of his fast tempi as though fast tempi is synonymous with lack of expressiveness to me bohm 's and mackerras' views of mozart are equally valid if there were only one mode of interpretation , one could program a computer to play the score to me a great work is capable of different interpretations morover , though the publication date is 2002 , many new recordings are simply missing like perahia 's marvellous recordings of bach 's keyboard concertos i am not replacing my penguin or gramophone as yet
suzanne is my hero ! someone finally put what i was feeling into words i had a hysterectomy when i was 24 and started experiencing changes around 35 but did n't know or understand what was happening to my body i searched high and low for answers , went to many doctors , none of which could address my issues just prescribed a bunch of synthetic drugs including anti depressants i refused thank god , feeling like there had to be a better way to handle than walking around like a zombie for the rest of my life in the last 5 years i 've experienced severe anxiety attacks , weight increase , headaches , night sweats , incomplete sleep , foggyness and overall i thought i was just loosing my mind then one day a friend gave me suzanne 's book the sexy years and i read through it in 4 days , often in tears because finally someone got it ! i'm not going crazy and there is a solution that does n't involve being drugged for the rest of my life ! thank you suzanne , i feel like you gave me a new lease on life p s i'm reading ageless and the education goes on
as it says in the forward , yes , the medical community should catch up with suzanne somers hormones are a complex subject , and the author suzanne is wise in the way this book is written and how the content is presented she asks the questions \( what we all want to know but were afraid to ask \) , and gives you her opinion but the book is in a question and answer format where the professionals are giving their answers you may not want to do it suzanne 's way , but she 's asked the right questions , and used her celebrity to bring attention to a very important topic one that professionals and patients should be more aware of , and that major pharmaceutical companies wish you were n't

i realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh , but i 'll tell you why this is true for me i read this book and decided that i too , would feel great and look great just like suzanne , i would go on bio identical hormones that was 2 years ago since then , i have lost almost 40 of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science the doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix , and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4 5 months i was told to 'be patient' , that it would 'normalize' i later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take , and now , 2 years later , i am in hell because of this book i ca n't believe how stupid i was
some of this book is good and normally i love suzanne summers but a few comments like no wonder men leave us for younger woman like what is that about \? woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging \? when i ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first i just felt the book was a push for the s principle book and to be hot for your guy usually her stuff is good but i was n't crazy about this one sorry nothing new in this book maybe helpful to someone else jud
i have been treating patients with bioidentical hormones for many years without having many books i could recommend to my patients i was glad when this book came out , because it has a pretty good overview ot this therapy in easily understood terms there are two things i particularly like one is that she interviews a few different experts on the subject , demonstrating the art of medicine that is needed in this type of treatment the other aspect i particularly liked is where she reasons with her doctor to put her back on hormones after she was treated for breast cancer her argument was well thought out , and is a good example of a patient doctor collaboration in healthcare some of the style of the book is a bit cutesy , but overall i believe it does a good service for the women who read it
the best book out there on the subject so many women go through life just doing what the doctor says this book takes you to the next level and really helps you understand your body and what is out there that can help this may not be for everyone , but it has worked wonders for me and the people i know
bio identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be they have serious , dangerous impacts on the human body please , if you are going to try these , do your homework first a growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects some do n't make it out the other side i am one of the lucky ones i survived the blood clots in my legs and two near fatal , year long illnesses connected with use of natural progesterone since that time , i have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones i hope this information will be helpful to someone else , too please , safeguard your health no one else is going to do it for you
the premise was great the storytelling , very awkward the technological information could have been interesting , but it read like an instruction manual i give one star for the final cat and mouse and another for the funny way mr clancy portrayed the soviet apparatchiks
maybe some people will not like it , but this book is as good as they come ! it 's plot is superbly and tightly woven the characters seem like people you could find in the supermarket , yet they turn into extraordinary people when facing extraordinary challenges clancy makes this transition in a very smooth way the events are concatenated in a highly logical way to get you to the final ending about the only thing i can criticize is the somehow biased stance it takes in usa ussr relations , but we have to remember that the book was written when the cold war was still something from the present
worth reading again for a thriller , the characters here are fabulous ramius is just perfect , very well crafted , as are ryan and almost all of the supports the research is spectacular , even though i wish it was more eloquently presented i gather from various high up navy friends that the silent drive is still an utter impossibility in real life but clancy 's work is so well done that it seems utterly plausible his research descriptions on various other technical subjects on radiation , etc are also top notch even after all these years , this one is still great five stars
this is one of tom clancy 's best jack ryan novels it is hard to put down once you get started the plot is intricate and interrelated without all the coincidences that mar some of clancy 's later novels he also has political points woven into the plot and action without the reader having to plod through page after page of pontification seen in some of his later novels \( even if you agree with clancy 's political views , it gets tedious in some of his books \) the details of submarine theory , construction and warfare are interesting without getting in the way of the story if you have seen the movie based on this book , you will still want to read the hunt for red october as it is much more detailed and exciting as other reviewers have also mentioned , this book is much shorter than some of clancy 's more encyclopedic novels that makes for much crisper reading and less flipping back in the book to sort out who is who this was an exciting book when it was published , and even though times have changed it is still a good read
the book the hunt for red october is about a nuclear submarine run by captain marko ramius of the soviet navy marko ramius secretly has a plan to get back at the soviets and avenge the death of his wife jack ryan , a cia member and an american is leading the investigation of the submarine the red october ramius sends a letter to the soviet dictator warning him of his plans this letter leads to an avalanche of events
the hunt for red october , an amazing novel by tom clancy , is an action packed adventure of political controversy and suspenseful combat the red october , the soviet union 's newest submarine , sets sail in the frozen arctic circle ramius , the captain of the red october sees this as an opportunity to take revenge for the avoidable death of his wife his plan is to defect to the united states will he make it , or will the soviets catch him before he can give the americans what they need to stay ahead of the soviets in race for the ultimate submarine \?
this was clancy 's first novel and it is his best the writing is fast paced this is a skill clancy would slowly lose over the next few novels , as he added detail after detail to virtually every scene here he gets the formula right
in a word , wow this book is ranked in the top five greatest books that i 've ever read clancy uses incredibly specific and intricate descriptions of the nautical military to create a real life atmosphere that the reader can relate to real military events were used to shape the plot of the story , and amazon com even states that clancy was rumored to have been debriefed by the white house during the production of this novel
heifetz' definition of leadership revolves around the concept of influence rather than subordination or coercion using contrast to sharpen his own definition of leadership , he wrote that there is an important difference between imagining that a leader influences a community to follow her vision and influencing a community to face its problems
i thought the book was good when i read it first it took me a second read to realize how exceptional it is the book 's reviews on amazon site range from 5 star to 1 star , from people who were amazed by its brilliance to those who could not despise it enough i think this is the best accolade that a leadership book can ever get it takes a stance , it provides direction , and it chooses to be for a great cause irrespective of whether it is loved or hated this book cannot and must not be ignored
i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything \( that would have been impossible anyway \) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader \( civil rights \) and unsuccessful leader \( vietnam \) his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on line book study at the work and worship institute website i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society
the most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant the book is not about a theory of leadership , but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree then the rest of his book is meaningless heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you do n't , then you are n't a good leader so , in heifetz 's world , reagan was n't a good leader , but lbj was
wow ! there is something truly amazing about the images and words of bone at heart , it 's a fairy tale , but one that appeals to the child in the adult and the adult in the child
i know that it seems that i have moved away from reviewing cinema lately and have deeply transformed into this graphic novel reader , but it could n't be further from the truth with my recent move , i have found ore time to be able to crack into these dusty books that have been sitting on my shelves for some time and fully experience the bizarre , yet imaginative , worlds that they boast i have witnessed the death of a superhero , the curse of a video , and now i am excited to say that i unknowingly jumped into the second chapter of jeff smith 's bone series i do n't know how this happened , but instead of starting from the beginning , i found that i actually owned the second book of his series , aptly called the great cow race unfamiliar with smith 's linear storytelling technique , i jumped into this novel expecting to understand everything that was laid before me i was unwittingly wrong
like the title says i 've read the odd disney comic , and they were good for a few chuckles but bone the great cow race was so funny , i had to put it down a few times to catch my breath from laughing so hard
at long last ! jeff smith 's epic high fantasy comic masterpiece is being produced in color
i have read bone from back when it first came out in individual comic issues i must say , this color edition , especially the hardcover one , is the nicest one yet the black and white original always felt a bit sparse for the tone and humor of the story the beautiful coloring in this edition is perfect i 've bought the two that have come out , and ca n't wait for the remaining 7 great job , scholastic
i am a big fan of n sparks and enjoyed this book as i do all of his books
sparks continues to make his readers feel i hope he continues to write for a long time
i use the notebook and a walk to remember as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses , i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer , i was more satisfied with the rescue taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl , etc , etc ,
i absolutely love all of nicholas sparks' books i have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you get your kleenex 's ready you ca n't go wrong here
i 've been adventuring off reading new writers that i 've been hearing about well sparks was one of them and after reading this i wonder why did it take me so long to read his books this book was really heart touching the mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his the love story was also great because that is somewhat reality when you loose someone or go threw hard times its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own i ca n't wait to read more of sparks books because i 've already heard so many great things about them
i just got done reading the rescue last night i just did n't like the part when taylor blamed himself for his father 's death he had a right to be happy and live his life the boy really likes taylor denise was a sweet lady i am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a dad you might want to read that book again i am a nicholas sparks fan i have been his fan for 1 year and a month i love all his stories , i will be looking forard to the next one in october
i have read several of nicholas sparks' books , but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story , but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way mr sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from mr sparks like the notebook or the wedding if you want a good romantic read
i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway , it was disappointing , really the book was slow , and it was too long for a story of its type i mean , i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it , i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow , but taylor 's self conflict was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me , go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked
was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free
important literature that tells of post emancipation united states and the problem of the color line perspective amazing
written originally in 1903 both as a gift to african americans and a gift from an african american , the souls of black folk describes through one man 's \( w e b du bois \) eyes the consciousness of turn of the century african americans using his own life as a social and psychological model , du bois traces the inner life of post emancipation and post reconstruction african americans whether one agrees with all , most , little , or none of du bois' conclusions , any serious student of african american history and self understanding ca n't afford to bypass this work
the usefulness of this book for us in 2005 lies in the way it gives a wider historical perspective on current debates over racially tinged political issues particularly affirmative action in college admissions and funding for inner city schools
standing alone , this is one of the great books of the last two or three centuries when you consider that it 's author eventually gave up on america and died in africa on the eve of the march on washington , it makes it perhaps the most necessary book for black people in america ever \( nods to the philosphies and opinions of marcus garvey notwithstanding \)
the audio cd version of dubois' souls of black folks is horrible the reader makes mistake after mistake he mispronounces words , makes breaks where none were to be taken , and his reading in general is poor he has made a vibrant and enjoyable read a boring and atrocious listening experience i guess i 'll have to find something else to listen to on those long drives do not , i repeat , do not purchase this rendering of souls
a bit of a slow read and disappointingly focused almost exclusively on black men \( ignoring women \) , but it is a worthwhile portrait of the position of american blacks in the late 19th century the second to the last chapter , the coming of john , is a moving story of how racism can throttle achievement
mainstream historians may object to some of the claims in this book , but john man has created quite a readable mix of travelogue and history this is more a work of interpretation , rather than direct research , as man has combined his own past learning about genghis khan and the mongols with his modern day travels to mongolia in search of surviving relics so do not expect newly detailed research breakthroughs , because this is one of those living history books one particular problem is that man uses a lot of conjecture and opinionating when tackling gaps or contradictions in the historical record but in the end , we do get a very good summary of all the present knowledge on genghis and his descendants , and man engagingly discusses this very intriguing and complex historical personage this especially applies to how genghis was surely a genius in military strategy and administration , and was a remarkable leader of men , while also being responsible for the destruction of dozens of classic cities and the slaughter of probably a few million people man also discusses the sheer hugeness of the mongols' empire building practices , why these once anarchic nomads decided to destroy every settled civilization in the known world then return to their simple pastoral lives , and how genghis has been deified as both a god and a devil by multiple societies ever since add to this man 's exploration of the modern landscape and the mongols' ongoing influence , and this conjectural but still very readable book really shows what made genghis and his boys tick doomsdayer520
just finished the paperback edition which has maps and color pictures a very good read in the manner of the best dogged english seekers after truth what can we know about g k today \? and what does he mean to present day mongolians and chinese \? a good combination of challenging travel in central asia and educated weighing of evidence , with wonderful writing about places
john man 's done a great job of sequencing the historic events in a way that captures the attention of the reader i must however hasten to add that not all the events have been asserted as facts leaving some scope for reader 's fantasy john tends to hop back and forth between decades and centuries at some points where in he tries to place the reader in an appropriate context to best understand and appreciate certain facets of genghis 's vision and life that might leave the readers a little lost in time \) over all a very well done book that leaves readers rather enlightened on the geopolitical dynamics of ancient eurasia
john man 's genghis khan is a chalenging and rewarding read it will come as a bit of a jolt to readers used to reading popular biographies of more modern figures this is a very different experience to reading about , say , churchill or kennedy more modern subjects have a wealth of source material available to the historian , whose task becomes one of selection and condensation not so for a 13th century leader whose life was often deliberately shrowded in secrecy man 's task is not to wade through volumes of material , but to actually find material and he does a terrific job
i grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping , as always , for a good read , but as well to learn a bit about a period of chinese history that i have not read deeply in alas , man 's book fails on both levels
this book contains a lot of useful information for the new teacher or the burned out teacher who needs a boost it 's useful in the sense that it tries to get teachers to stop taking negative beahvior personally \( usually it 's not about the teacher \) and to use positive reinforcement as much as possible always a good idea whenever you are trying to change behavior , be it animal or human ! but i had to laugh out loud when the author suggests praising the consistently tardy student for being in class most of the time give me a break !
alexander and the terrible , horrible , no good , very bad day is an absolute classic of children 's literature , even if i have heard judith viorst 's story done way too often at speech tournaments the idea of feeling so mad or sad that you want to move to australia remains one of the great punch lines in alexander 's not \( do you hear me \? i mean it ! \) going to move she comes up with a story almost as good alexander might talk about moving to australia , but when his mom and dad tell him that the family is moving to a new home a thousand miles away he decides that he is not going to move he is not even going to pack
alexander , who 's not \( do you hear me \? i mean it ! \) going to move by judith viorst is a great childrens book it is wonderfully illustrated by robin preiss glasser the storyline is realistic and approaches a subject in a creative style it is attractive to young readers and manages to shed light on alexander 's negative feelings towards moving alexander ends up happy and so will the reader
i thought this book was a very good book for kids of all ages i'm sure you would agree with me the book talked about everyone pacjing and getting all of thier things ready for the bid move and how alexander was being stubborn this would be a good xmas present for someone planning on moving this book was long enough to get the message across , but not too long
this is a very well done book on one of the most beautiful college campuses in america the architecture is spectacular , architect cram created a style for rice , it was unique to rice , it is an amalgamation of byzantine and venician styles and it suits the houston climate perfectly through the years subsequent architects have created their own interpretation of cram 's architecture , for the most part it has worked though the lamented fondren library terminates the axis and is an unwelcome intrusion , but it is soon to be completly rebuilt so hopefully it will better suit cram 's buildings on the main quad the setting of the university is breathtaking , i recommend anyone visiting houston to take time to stroll the campus , it is symply stunning stephen fox is one of the foremost authorities on houston architecture , so it is quite fitting that he authored this book high recommended , beautiful campus and architecture , the crown jewel of texas higher education and that comes from a die hard texas ex
this is a fascinating , original take on what lies ahead rather than project a single future , authors joel a barker and scott w erickson examine existing trends and group them into five regions of technology they explain each technology , extrapolate the future it might create if it alone shaped the world , and then discuss how these different technological currents might intersect barker and erickson paint their five futures in broad swaths this allows them to cover a lot of ground and sketch many potential markets and challenges , but it also means that they cover their ground shallowly of the five technologies they examine , they are far more solidly grounded in super tech , limits tech and nature tech than in local tech or human tech they sometimes treat individual and place them in categories their fans might dispute for example , science fiction author isaac asimov was a long time supporter of population control and of limiting the power of machines , but he is found here in super tech rather than limits tech these small nuances should not take away from your enjoyment of this book , which we recommend to managers who want to plan for a flexible , productive future , and to those who enjoy mental experiments and challenges , since , at times , it is simply fun to read

there is a lot going on in academic and commercial labs that are rather invisible to the ordinary public the results however have the potential to change our life completely this book gives a very thorough insight into current developments and more , it also helps you to imagine how these technologies are being used in the real lives of persons
joel coined the phrase anticipating the future , in my mind and continues that focus quite well , with new perspectives , in this very readable , clearly written , short book i'm insisting participants in my leadership learning forums study it and discuss i
this is a great book the value of the five regions is its ability to segment the potential future applications of technology into five distinct areas , which provides for a great deal of clarity and depth i found the book 's content on technology to be especially relevant and useful the five regions assessment also allowed me to expand my own cognitive horizon on how i tend to see the various technologies in application , while also expanding my vision into new worlds of application as always , barker 's observations are intertwined with science and research , thereby opening our eyes and our minds to fascinating possibilities indeed , the book also left me intrigued i had a renewed sense of excitement about the future utilization of technology all in all , this book is written in true barker style it is incredibly captivating yet understandable , stimulating , and well worth reading
as a process futurist , joel barker is a very familiar name his earlier book titled paradigms , introduced the word paradigm to a wider audience in the business arena i highly recommend that book to anyone intereted in understanding the nuances of paradigmic change in organizations
all of us have a bias when it comes to technology and the future one of the great strengths of this book is that it makes each reader aware of her or his bias and provides perspective on other dimensions that limit or encourage future technology development do we see technology as unbounded or creating new problems that threaten to overwhelm us \? do we see the race with population and pollution as unwinnable or as easily won \? do we look at the giant technologies or do we look for what is small and beautifully efficient \? with the expanded view of all these points of view , the wise technologist or executive can choose more promising directions
barker 's book provides a radical new way of categorizing technology something we 've been without in the modern age in addition to giving us a series of frameworks on which we can base our decisions about the direction of our future , he illustrates how our current course in the united states is extremely destructive and ultimately unsustainable if enough people read this , then perhaps our course can be changed for the better
i read five regions and it drew me back to re read joel 's other works it is such a power segmentation of where technology has been lupmed together and joel 's perspective really brings focus back to where our species is heading technologically technology has alway been encompassing now looking at human tech , nature tech et all it become galringly obvious there is so much mis understanding of the nature of technology its hard to discern where the future is headed five regions really brought back focus to major areas of innovation for me and my collegues thank you joel it look sliek you are coining new venacualr and creating a new technology lexile again
joel has done it again he has always had an uncanny knack for seeing the future and describing it in ways that help others understand and this book is no exception regardless of which region view you believe is to be the future , you can not afford to be ignorant of the others this is a very valuable book for any ceo or exec that plans to be around for the future well done joel , thanks

save you money ! this is n't really suitable for anyone who cares what their children read much , much better can be found elsewhere
lynee cheney 's `a time for freedom what happened when in america' is an interesting book which ensures that its readers , comprising of students and adults alike to be aware of key events that took place within its recent development from the arrival of the pilgrims to the destruction of the world trade center on september 11 , 2001 in this book , she outlines and reinforces the importance of such dates as 1492 , 1607 , 1620 , 1776 , and 1787 however , as she explains , an actual comprehension of american history cannot be explained with a presentation of dates exclusively thus , she places a great deal of emphasis on chronology
thank you once again to lynne cheney for caring enough to write a book for all of us who need to appreciate the history of our country more than we do this book does more than just inform , it invites the average american to delight in the events that have contributed to the forming of our great america i am proud to be an american and have watched friends and family make sacrifices for the freedom of all , but i remain one of the typical victims of the history snobs \( otherwise known as history professors and experts \) who cared more about impressing students with their high intellect than instilling a love for the history of our country in their students even at my age , after reading this book i am motivated to read more about some of the historical events presented in mrs cheney 's enlightening timeline i am encouraged that a book like this can be given to young people and we can expect that their interest in historical events will be piqued i plan to give this book to many people \( young and old \) as a gift to them and to all of us who want to see the pride and love of american history returned to its people ! i highly recommend this book
this is a wonderfully written resource for anyone who wants to brush up on their american history the timeline format allows the reader to follow multiple stories at the same time and understand the context in which they occurred mrs cheney 's succinct prose is complemented by a compilation of interesting quotations from many of our country 's most famous \( and some not as famous but no less important \) figures this book is a great starting point for anyone looking to reacquaint themselves with our country 's past i find myself using it as a reference for placing specific events within a larger context , which has helped me gain a greater appreciation for the complex story of america a great gift for graduating high school students or your favorite college grad , as well as for anyone who enjoys american history
the art in both of lynne cheney 's books that i 've read are awesome ! very colorful and eye catching !
i did n't read the entire book , simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore however , it does n't take much more than 20 min to get through it the book is nothing but a timeline of miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences you might learn some trivia going through it but not much else it is also not a very objective view of us history not a single factoid given for the 8 years of the clinton presidency was positive , only negatives
lynne cheney reveals her love for america 's history and her commitment to scholarship in a time for freedom a chronology of america 's past from the arrival of the first americans to the present day , this book presents the events that shaped our country in a way that is understandable and compelling cheney 's organization of the book it passes through history in date order , with short summaries of events instead of complicated explanations gives the reader a sense of context that is rare in history literature , yet essential for understanding our national story i learned that in 1968 alone , north vietnam launched the tet offensive assassins murdered martin luther king , jr and robert kennedy police used tear gas against antiwar activists at the chicago democratic convention and women protested the miss america pageant , in that order understanding this national suffering is surely necessary if we are to appreciate the hope that neil armstrong inspired across the country when , in early 1969 , he became first person to walk on the moon !
joan grant and her husband denys kelsey take turns writing their accounts of life in france during and after wwii and how they use her gift of seeing into the far past past lives to help psychologically maimed patients the tone is very humble and yet matter of factly and helps us understand our own continuity and moral responsibilities suffering is indeed unnecessary and death is nothing to be afraid of
i still have my first edition copy of agee on film
james agee wrote film criticism in america at a time when the american film industry hardly deserved his attention his celebrations of silent film comedy , of preston sturges , of john huston for whom he later wrote the script for the african queen , and of the handful of worthy foreign films that he managed to see are what make this volume worth reading besides agee 's beautiful prose and above all his compassion interestingly , agee was a fan of frank capra 's comedies \( it happened one night \) and bemoaned the director 's decent into serious social films \( mr smith goes to washington , meet john doe \) his negative review of it 's a wonderful life , which has never been in print since it appeared in 1946 , reveals the extent to which agee was perhaps too far ahead of his time , and even of ours
agee on film , part of martin scorsese 's wonderful new series of great film books from the past , is a really enjoyable read it contains a lot of interesting reviews of classic hollywood films by an articulate , witty writer , who himself wrote the screenplays to some great films , like night of the hunter i love the way that the essays in this book are both thoughtful and direct he has important things to say about what some films suggest about human nature and society , but at other times he 's quick and to the point agee writes at the beginning that he thinks everyone is an amateur when it comes to films , because what matters the most is not what you know but how a movie affects you i like that quality in him he is n't so pretentious that he ca n't admit when a movie just does n't move him he writes in a really down to earth way , but his reviews are n't simplistic or rushed , like many of the reviews i read today some of my favorite parts of this book are the essays where he quickly gives his take on a bunch of films , writing funny though sometimes harsh one line quips \( for example several tons of dynamite were set off in this movie , none of it under the right people \) this book is especially informative and entertaining for movie fans , but also would be useful as instruction on writing about art really , though , it should be fun to read for just about anyone
this book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by anne frank i read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and i visited the anne frank house in amsterdam it was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real i would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site
i have just finished the diary of a young girl and i have the strong feeling that i was moved back in time , as if it was 1944
the diary of a young girl is an inspiring story where i learned about some circumstances and events in the time of world war 2
a year ago , i was forced to read this book by my english teacher at first , looking at the cover , \( it was red with a picture of a girl \) i had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it
this was such a well written book , that you would think an adult wrote to know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as anne 's anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive this book really gives a great picture of what the jewish community went through , all the unjust moves against them it made me gain more respect for all religions and races this book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people we can never understand all the hardships the franks went through , but we can help those going through similar persecution
it was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the nazis during wwii i highly recommend this book and i hope i can one day go see the anne frank museum where the family lived during this time

mr dow 36 , 000 wants you to believe him this time no , really , he means it right in 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust i think that 's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust this guy is amazing
ms phillips has written a frightening non fiction treatise that is right up there with jared diamond 's collapse thanks to its lucidity , it is a rather quick read her writing is exquisite but the content , ah , the content is indeed disturbing no external enemy will ever destroy western civilization , its culture or its values no , the west , if it is to be destroyed will be destroyed from within , as it loses its will to resist and defend itself it is at that point that we will simply surrender not to the barbarians outside the gate , but to those inside it
this is a very important book if you want to know what happens to a country that has bought into politically correct , multicultural , and relativistic nonsense
mandatory reading for anyone who believes in multiculturalism and for those who do n't melanie phillips provides a factual commentary and incisive analysis of the political and legal decisions , which have led great britain away from its traditional culture and beliefs and transformed it into today 's fractured society , whose past values are being discarded proactively and passively by the strong multi cultural forces applied during the past 40 years
this book is a fascinating account of the relationships between the european liberal movement and islam and how this is changing and affecting the political life of england and also western europe
a notable parallel to the direction america is headed shocking wake up call
melanie phillips reveals how london has degenerated into a terrorist incubator , surrounded by spineless politicians who quiver at any insinuation of being diversity phobes great read
phillips nails it and it 's coming here to a city near you
this book expertly describes how and why the muslim community within london gives birth to a group of radical men whom go on to committ terror throughout the world the author questions why england has not confronted these sects more head on without the worry of insulting muslems an interesting and worthy point is one that indicates that living in england does not give anyone the right to denounce the goverment to the point of proclaiming death to the goverment officials maybe its time to send these people back to the 'war torn' areas from which they came from and allow them to express their 'freedoms' and collect ' state financial aid' there this point is raised and the reader has the option of agreeing or not the best thing about this book is that it was written and demands that action be taken place to quell an uprising taking place
the best book on the history of world war ii that i 've read in a long time
this is an excellent book covering the bomber war over europe in the final two years of world war ii it is authored by two more recent raf veterans and the book is simply outstanding
i often read about others that say they ca n't put the book down because it is soooooooooooooo captivating well , tail end charlies did that to me what a super read a dose of history and a dose of personal perspectives all in one it is also an objective perspective relating to butch harris do n't pass this one up
in suttree , cormac mccarthy does n't so much shake the rafters of the illusory of literature as he does bore holes in its foundation when his novel was published in 1979 , you probably would have to have been a mccarthy reader to know about it undoubtedly , there were erudite mccarthy readers making some noise over his three , previous works , but they were likely fairly small in number as to his work , the old adage comes to mind nothing worth having comes easily , and if you are to consider the dark themes and brittle , agrarian subject matter of his pre suttree work , you might be able to explain his relative obscurity but , oh , how mccarthy takes these themes into knoxville , tennessee and with stunning craftsmanship , conjures up a visionary , humdinger of a novel we have before us an astonishingly compelling and deeply personal opus that only a master storyteller could construct
for me , this the best book i 've read by mccarthy as usual he investigates the darker side of humanity , in this case following the trials and tribulations of cornelius suttree it is not the easiest of reads but perseverence pays dividends i see the people have complained about the lack plot ca n't say i even noticed because it stands up quite well without one it details the life of suttree as he eeks out a living on a houseboat while spending his free time in bars knocking around with less than desirable folk if you find the beginning a bit of a heavy read just hang in there until harrogate enters the scene absolutely superb , reminds me of ratso from midnight cowboy \( also highly recommended \) mccarthy certainly loves to describe a scene situation down to the merest minutae so you might find yourself passing over a few paragraphs while trying to get back to the heart of the story and if nothing else you 'll certainly come away remembering 3 things watermelons , tunnels and bats a superb read
suttree is an extremely challenging book i picked it up , read the first thirty or so pages , then put it down for two years before i finally dedicated myself to reading the whole thing the narrative occurs in elliptic little episodes , with no particular overarching plot many reviewers here have cited this as a flaw , but mccarthy is breaking the ordinary traditions of narrative here for a reason a life does not progress in neat order , nor do most people live to see some golden denouement that makes sense of all their previous decisions suttree the character lives without this happy sense of order , and mccarthy has no desire to provide it to the reader as in life , some things happen , some more things happen , and then the story ends in the hands of a less skillful writer this could have been an appalling mess , but mccarthy 's incredible gifts make it at once satisfying and heartbreakingly incomplete
ok for a brief opinion , i think this is an absolutely amazing work of fiction that ranks up there with the best of faulkner it ranks up there with the best books ive ever read the prose really makes me reread passages out loud , just as previously posted by another reviewer
mccarthy is a very talented writer \( read blood meridian and all the pretty horses \) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing , using many archaic words suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot despite the novel 's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character certain chapters are interesting \( the workhouse chapter especially \) , but these passages are few and far between also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way mccarthy writes about nature beautifully , but after finishing this book , one is left unfulfilled
okay , i'm going to go against the grain here and say that suttree really is n't all that good maybe it 's fine literature although personally i do n't think so i think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of , absorbed into with a pathos for its characters , good or bad here we get only snatches of that at times we feel akin to suttree for example the prison segment is good there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book but on the whole suttree is a rambling and confusing mess why struggle so much with a book \? it 's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex sure , at times it 's sublime but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline the reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes the relationship between suttree and harrogate is great , but there needs to be more of it i feel like saying yeah , yeah , yeah , just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of suttree 's mysterious past if you want to read this , you have been warned you will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting \? if you think it 's worth it in the name of literature , then that 's up to you
i in 1996 i bought and read all the pretty horses first laughed myself off the train seat in to town bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order re reading pretty horses on the way along with scenes from the orchard keeper , sutree sticks in my mind images ideas , flavours , jokes , and a personality that i 'd rather see more of sutree made me feel that i know this man , and could even like him great fun , and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading
absolutely exquisite perhaps that adjective gets overused nowadays , but here it is appropriate perhaps even not strong enough of a term suttree is a must must must read it is such a profound indictment of the human race that it could be used as evidence against us if we are ever sued by space aliens when viewed in terms of blood meridian and all of c mcc 's pre natl book award works , his range as an author is revealed and is humbling the man is our greatest living novelist i am grateful to him for having offered this work to the world
i cannot understand anyone having a problem with this book maybe it is too long for some but that is why it is called literature likewise , if you do not like the slow pace and lack of action , pick up a grisham novel during your visit to the airport and chuckle along the way this is the best southern mccarthy novel by far and equal to blood meridian remember , turtles make good soup and do not try and kill your neighbor 's pig without first asking
i came across this book when advising a friend 's college age child who was researching careers and was using this book
i am saddened by the utterly unfair and inappropriate posting here by one reader she had not read the book , but because i am a mere moderate feminist rather than a radical one , she chooses to excoriate me here a far more unbiased source , usa today 's review of my book said , from finding the well suited job to customizing it , this book is full of smart advice in the reader 's choice poll , it was rated the 1 most useful career guide here on amazon , you can read sample material from the book i encourage you to do that before making your decision
sorry , i just cannot believe that the humorous and honest approaches recommended in this book will work it all seems very idealistic , flaky and undignified i value honesty \( and humor too ! \) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum i would find someone using these strategies very off putting the words sense of entitlement come to mind and i am not conservative so what would a conservative employer think
enjoyed the book and ca n't wait to see the movie lots of action provocative
this book was a fast read and interesting from the first few pages
at best dan brown 's da vinci code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones the characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70 's made for tv movies if you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin , the first time the true villain makes an appearance , it is basically a well is n't that contrite moment but it is a fast easy reading novel this book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight
i found this to be a really annoying , and in the audio format annoyingly told story it sounds like a screenplay , with symbolism , mystery , and trivia that are so mediocre how best to describe it \? here , read the book if you think this is fascinating the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it 's round like a mother 's womb if that does n't blow you away , read something else
despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book there is nothing new in this title clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line it is also worth noting that at least one of the great organizations in the book , fannie may , has imploded in an accounting scandal not the worst fad management book ever written , but that is n't saying much
the book separates core values from the operating practices of
this is one of the business classics in the past twenty years it has sold a huge number of copies and i am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read ! as impressive as its sales numbers have been , the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive
a very inspiring book about creating and maintaining a vision for yourself , your company and even applicable to your own family
jim collins' books are well researched , easy to read , and usually provide thoughtful , actionable guidlines for business owners this book fits that mold in the context of describing precisely the framework that is needed to build a company that will both last a long time and outperform the market
this is a book that tries to uncover the common traits between companies considered visionary \( companies that are regarded as being the standard bearers for the industry they compete in , that outperform the market and have been around for at least 50 years \)
i found built to last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success core development and maintenance , personal growth , employee development and more , highlight the outside the bottom line look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader 's tenure of influence although i do n't agree with every aspect of the book i still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking
i'm an employee with a small educational business , and i 've started reading more business related stuff to get some perspective on how i can help our business evolve i recently read first , break all of the rules and i picked this book up as a follow up to get a different vantage point on growing a business this study , completed in the early 1990s , focuses on 18 historically visionary companies that have built stable core cultures that can serve as role models for any business
tony judt 's postwar a history of europe since 1945 is the well researched material from a british conservative born 1948 in london and educated at cambridge and paris on political , social and economic developments in europe following world war ii
postwar is truly a huge achievement while it is a long book , it is actually short given how much ground judt covers and how effectively he covers it the book starts with a great synopsis of some under stated facts and thoughts about the impact that wwii had on europe as a whole and on its constituent parts this book is worth reading for that synopsis alone
i have just finished mr judt 's tome on modern europe i am a little embarrassed to admit that it took me several months i enjoyed learning the information the book is certainly filled with detail it is not by any means an easy read or a page turner , however although i agree with some other reviewers that the us' role is deemphasized a bit , overall i felt the author was fairly objective in contrast to a reviewer 's comment that the french will love this book , i would argue that the author reveals the french during this period as deeply flawed certainly the soviet leadership properly receives a great deal of blame , as do many of the citizenry throughout europe i agree that the book 's strength lies in the breadth of the information , which at first seems overwhelming but is kept semi manageable mr judt is less successful in neatly synthesizing all the info , but i personally think that that is primarily a realistic function of the subject matter i did find the epilogue discussing specifically the treatment of jews a little jarring in its placement
postwar a history of europe since 1945 by tony judt is the best book i have read on the subject its perspective on events since 1989 up to 2005 is remarkably good
see what happens when the author 's friends write the reviews \? after all the glowing raves given postwar , i spent fancy money on it , and in the end , i came to agree with the only negative review of it i saw , in the economist you are misled by the acuity of the first chapter , in which judt explains how much the current peace of europe derives from the severe ethnic cleansing that took place there during and just after world war ii a fascinating point quite new to me but after that , over 830 pages , judt tries to explain everything and gets to the bottom of nothing what did margaret thatcher really accomplish for england \? i still do n't know , though i learned a lot on my way to not knowing this was the failing cited by the economist reviewer , too if you want a history of the war 's aftermath in europe \( though only up to the mid fifties \) try 1945 by gregor dallas distilled , acute , clear , concrete , fresh , and compelling maybe dallas needs to hustle academic insiders as well as judt does , for unlike judt , dallas actually delivers the goods and deserves the credit wasted on judt
englishman tony judt 's postwar is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking to give a coherent account of the history of europe from 1945 the outline of events is well known a continent in ruins at the end of the second world war , the miraculous rise of western europe from the wreckage , the concurrent enslavement of the east , and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems , culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control it is a great story , surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization
much as i admire judt 's writing and breadth of knowledge , i'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography , which are relegated to a website i imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript , but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers
professor judt's book will certainly be the reference guide to the history of europe for years to come
i have read this book twice and i loved it mowat wrote as if the tug was a living thing it was wonderful i actually cried at the end when franklin came into the harbor with barely any power left and covered entirely with ice , thus ending her life the people who captained franklin intriqued me as well in the book they were the only ones that really cared for her
i first discovered grey seas under about 15 years ago , appropriately enough as able seaman on an ocean salvage tug i was immediately enthralled out of the many books on the sea i have read , this one remains very dear to me \( not that you have to be a mariner to enjoy it \) grey seas under is the true story of the ocean salvage tug , foundation franklin and the brave men who battled the north atlantic to save hundreds of ships and thousands of lives farley mowat , a master srory teller , passionately desribes the exploits of foundation franklin with geat admiration and humor grey seas under is a true masterpiece saga of the sea i 've read this book probably 6 times in the last 10 years and i'm sure to re read it for many years to come i cannot recommend this book enough i also highly recommend the serpents coil also by farley mowat , another first rate tale of the sea
farley mowat can make the stars sing with the sheer beauty of his writing his writing is a little old fashioned by today 's standards , \( all the better \) but his craftsmanship is unsurpassed you are there you feel everything his characters felt , you see what they saw the book ends happily and i know it , but i cry through the last chapter every time i read it because his writing takes me there one hedge the book does start slow , but if you keep plugging away , you will be richly rewarded
i read this book about 5 years ago , lost it and have been trying to find it for about 5 years it is one of the best books that i have read i could not put it down i have had some sea adventures myself but nothing like this i have recomended it to all my marine friends but have not been able to locate it until today
according to the authors and contributors , the example of jesus christ contains indispensable lessons for leadership however , in the gospel , jesus seems to have commanded disciples primarily to love god and one another he never seems to have promised success in worldly business affairs or to have offered managerial precepts on the other hand , in the parable of talents he taught his followers to be fiscally conservative and to invest wisely to their credit , the authors and editors who compiled this book acknowledge that christianity never set itself up specifically as a recipe for business success regardless , they conclude , that applying precepts they identify will lead to success the leadership guidelines they quote make sense and do not exclude thoughtful businesspeople of any theological background the authors illustrate their advice with amusing , instructive anecdotes the counsel is accessible , ethically illuminating and personally inspiring , although if you usually skip the sermon , it may not be for you we believe that its primary appeal will be to christians who seek to serve as servant leaders in their communities and workplaces

i was struck by something brian greene says in the intro to this
these earlier , shorter stories are rather flat , and do n't stand up to tomine 's later work , collected in summer blonde tomine works best when he has the time and space allotted to really build his characters , and the short stories herein do not allow for it as simply a portrait of a developing young artist , sleepwalk and other stories is somewhat interesting , but certainly not a fully realized or especially enjoyable book
adrian tomine is a comic art minimalist despensing of unnecessary elements like thought balloons , he relies entirely on dialogue and visuals his style is spare , unlike many of his more mainstream peers , and his narratives are far removed from the spandex exploits of superman or batman all of tomine 's characters are flawed human beings , following these stories may make one feel somewhat despairing , but a vague sense of hope lingers as well
tomine is an excellent artist and storyteller unfortunately his quiet stlye makes him easy to miss
this was easy enough to read in one sitting \( for those of us lacking a lot of free time \) but interesting and emotional enough to linger i really truly loved it and was especially impressed by his ability to sooooo nail the feelings of some of his characters i mean , they are his characters , his creation , so of course they are what he wants them to be , but outside of that fact , the characters in sleepwalk are very true to their situations take a look at the story about dylan and donovan , the twin girls this one most amazed me as far as i know adrian tomine is not a twin and he is certainly not a high school girl yet the things dylan is feeling felt so genuine to me while i was reading it was her speaking , not tomine this is not exclusive to tomine , i know of course writers create believable characters and of course these characters are often nothing like their creator , but tomine seems to go one further he is able to create reality in only a few pages realities that are maybe a little dark , or even outright depressing , but so human and so undoubtedly real
this is perhaps one of the best comic books or books period ever written it is a statement of how common life can be interesting , because we can all relate to it the anonymous reader who initially reviewed this obviously has either not read the aforementioned work or was too dense to understand it 's deeper implications it is unfortunate that in the comics world stories like this do n't receive as much attention as superhero comics for a vastly underaprecciated and misunderstood medium , this is a statement of what comics can be
this book features stephen huneck 's brilliant canine wood block prints the book is colorful and suitable for all ages kids will love the whimsy it offers , while adults will enjoy the sly insights into canine mental processes the introduction of the book explains how huneck overcame a nearly fatal illness with the help of his dog , a black labrador retriever named sally , setting the tone for his deep appreciation for dogs
i use this book in my work doing animal assisted interventions with at risk children the kids love learning how a dog 's brain works or more likely how dogs are driven to pleasure seeking behavior the pictures can also be pretty powerful particulary the page good dog and bad dog with the split brain this is very helpful teaching children about how our brain actually divides itself at times under stress when i explain this in the picture the kids feel so much better about themselves great work
the diagram of sally 's brain is great , just how i imagine it the illustrations are wonderful and his love for animals really shows through
if you 've ever owned a dog or have been owned by one , this book is for you ! you 'll find it even more familiar if you happen to own a labrador retriever the subject matter is the simple yet adorable mind of our dog friends stephen huneck apparently has put a lot of time into the this book the art is fantastic
this was the first book i read on quality a long time ago and stills on my bookshelf
ishikawa makes a careful and intense analysis about the meaning of the quality control its reading is ver interesting and passionate it is a fundamental tool for all those managements who really want improve their productivity in their respective work places
this book provides another perspective on the mind of the ceo worth reading
after reading the reviews of the book , i expected much more the e book really just whets your appetite with generalities \( e g , about the internet or globalization \) summarized from the full text version one could get far more from a typical on line article in fortune , business week , etc the e book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text , double spaced i guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book i would still like to read the full text version but i would advise avoiding the e book version
the author integrates coaching with systems thinking and the learning organization popularized by peter senge 's book the fifth discipline this revised edition shows the hargrove 's approach is still fresh and surprisingly unique , given all the recent books published on coaching
i found hargrove 's book inspiring , insightful , and useful i had read his first book which was pivotal for me in creating my own coaching business and have found that he has taken this work to another level a very compelling , as well as easy read the two parts that i found most applicable to my own coaching clients were his step by step approach to coaching executives and the part on creating a laboratory that fosters collaboration within a group i was able to bring these principles to a client who was wowed by what we were able to generate for her business i would recommend this book to any coach , internal and external to a company , as well as to any leader who wants to create an impossible future
i'm not really a big of grant morrison 's work i find a lot of his work to be the kind of stuff i thought up and then decided does have enough depth to carry it in a story with that said , invisibles takes the cake when it comes to that while it may be different , that does n't mean it has any depth if you 're a fan of morrison 's , go do yourself a favor and read the seven soldiers trades or his arkham asylum stuff but stay away from the invisibles
i just read the review bad mouthing this and wanted to cancel him out by giving this 5 it 's a great book , one of the most imaginative comics of all time and it 's easy to grasp and understand if you pay attention also , try and read more than 3 issues sometime , eh \?
long ago , a friend who raved about the invisibles loaned me this first book i do n't have very clear memories of it , but i remembered it as being very hard to read , and i remember not getting very far in it before i lost interest
i wo n't take the time to review each tpb of this series separately because really it 's a continuous story that i think should be taken as a whole the invisibles is very entertaining and highly thought provoking being that i 've never read anything else by morrison i do n't know if he believes in the ideas expressed in spiritual science fiction style books , or whether this whole series was his type of satire but it 's a clever series , and worth it for fans of comic books , liberal politics , spirituality , conspiracy , punk rock , science fiction , and literature alike
let me start by saying that the invisibles is by far my favorite comic book of all time it is such a demanding and rewarding experience i read the entire series at least once a year and not once have i grown tired or bored by a single page or panel
what makes the invisibles such a powerful story are the characters and how they relate to each other when the character relationships are n't in flux , attention wanders i think that the series improves when king mob throws his guns away and things get extra whacky many other reviewers have accurately reported how uneven this first collection is because of the departure taken in the time travel arc the story shifts its focus onto characters who are not so easy to relate to
ok , so maybe art is not so great , maybe not everything is explained , and second half was extremely lame because of showing desade as one of invisibles and good guy , but this comic is full of esothery and is social and pop culture kind of satire and criticism its value is that it points to something nothing else does and first four issues , dane in london and his initiation are great theory of conspiracy fans will enjoy all of the invisibles , and some of ideas shown in series were reexploited later , watered down of course
this first volume of grant morrison 's subversive series , the invisibles , represents a range of ideas and concepts , including a disdain for all forms of authority , the existence of strange and powerful magic in the mundane , and the codification of modern pop culture into a new religion the invisibles of the title , one cell of many , comprise a group of unlikely miscreants a smart street thug with mysterious powers a former police officer a transvestite brazilian shaman and an insane precognitive leading them is king mob , who , in addition to being a fairly obvious stand in for the author , personifies the multitude of rebellious anti establishment sentiments that form the core of the book
the first time i read it , i was confused the second time i read it , i thought i mostly understood what was going on this time , i get it no , really this work is crammed with philosophical commentary , conspiratorial speculation , new age pseudo science , and just plain madness i look forward to how much more i'm sure to find the next time i read it
the invisibles is the only comic i 've ever collected from first issue to last when it started in 1994 i was a sophomore in college , and when it ended a few months into 2000 i was holed up in a soul sapping corporate job regardless , during those 6 years i was able to get my hands on each issue , despite the fact that i 'd quit reading comics in high school but there was something special about the invisibles , and it kept me coming back for more i even set up a service with the local comic store so they 'd hold each month 's issue for me , and i 'd come in every few weeks , grab them , and high tail it out of there
very helpful read for anyone that has lost a child
if you are looking for the academic lecture video by this same title \( the one hour lecture delivered at unc \) , this is n't it this is a shorter video , with a pragmatic focus on individual persons and families dealing with catastrophic loss a good primer for health care workers , but does not have the broad academic , philosophic , and theological applications that the earlier lecture video has
i wish more people could see that their humanity in the world rather than try to be god , or relentlessly seek answers when none exist this is a brilliant discourse on the sadder parts of the human experience rather than try to alleviate pain by trying to find out why a tragedy happened , etc it is often more healing to also see the humanity of an event when no real explanation is possible bad things happen to good people and vice versa this world is complex and simple at the same time but most of all , this book is a blessing against the current wave of new age blame game mumbo jumbo
this book is an easy and enjoyable read about a difficult philosophical topic it deals with the practical reality of the exisence of evil and ties it to a combination of random chance and people 's free will that is the underlying thesis and deep philosophical arguments are avoided
heard the taped version of when bad things happen to
excellent ! i gave this book to my sister who lost her granddaughter to cancer and she said it provided the most help of all thanks so much
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution
this is the least preachy bible study i 've ever read
this book is so easy to read it is as if you are having a conversation with a close friend i was so inspired by this book , i am ordering many more to pass along
i singled out this book as i felt i 'd come to a fork in the road of my life i could choose to be bitter after the premature birth and death of my son or i could try to seek out better ways to live my now very different life i started this book dubious of its content i expected to be lectured instead i found myself reading with an open mouth shocked at how accurately my loss was explained it was as if this wonderfully gifted rabbi had invisibly witnessed the events of my life , the times when my relatives would say the dumbest and most cruel comments instead of being talked at , i found i was reading a book a kind friend had written just for me i am not religious or spiritual , i guess you could say i'm confused , however his book has opened my eyes to a different , kinder religion than the one i had always felt was judgemental
this comprehensive book will help any breast cancer survivor navigate the medical system and become her own best advocate for quality health care
this book saved me when i has having chemotherapy and ended up with constant insomnia i had not read about that as a side effect of breast cancer treatments until this book which has a good discussion of drugs usually used to treat breast cancer i had read lots of books prior to my treatment and only this one mentioned drugs used to treat insomnia if had n't of known , i probably would still be staring at the ceiling all night wondering what the heck was going on ! ! !
i am a primary care physician and read this book with an eye toward recommending it to my patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer i found the book to be thorough , compassionate and very clearly written it 's an unusual book as other reviewers have commented , breast cancer guides are either from md breast cancer experts or from patients this is the only book i am aware of written by someone who has lived both sides of this disease i will recommend this book strongly to my patients with breast cancer , and also to their family members and friends thanks to dr kaelin and ms coltrera for providing us with such a terrific resource
this is the best book i have read on breast cancer because it addresses the biology of breast cancer with the reality of the symptoms it is written by a physician who knows what it is like to lose every single eyelash , and can tell you not only why you lost it , but how to keep on smiling without it this book has it all even a whole chapter on the effects of aggressive chemotherapy on cognitive skills and how to cope when i read the tip 'jot down where you parked your car' , i knew this was the book for me i had already been doing this if there is only one book you are going to read on breast cancer , this is the one
we have read many books on breast cancer and this is one of the best it is easy to read , easy to navigate , and provides alot of answers from a dr who has been there
you never think of doctors as patients , but this book not only is about a doctor who had cancer but a breast cancer specialist who developed breast cancer as a newly diagnosed patient myself , i must say that it was probably a greater shock for someone who knows so much about the disease to find out that she is in the same frightening position as her patients
if you just want the latest research , go read the new england journal of medicine if you want the latest research plus experience , understanding , compassion , and answers to your most embarrassing questions , get this book !
most books about breast cancer are either written from the point of view of a doctor or of a patient this wonderful book comes from the education and experience of a doctor and from the experience of a patient in knowing both sides , dr kaelin is able to share information in a way that i have not seen in any book before i am very thankful that she has provided this valuable resource for those who are just beginning the journey of dealing with breast cancer and for those , like me , who have been on this road for quite awhile even after 8 yrs of being cancer free , i have found quite a bit of very useful information in dr kaelin 's book this is a must have book for every patient diagnosed with breast cancer
dr kaelin 's book show us the medical side of breast cancer from the surgeon and specialist however , each section is sparkled with the knowledge of the patient as well
dr kaelin 's book is an outstanding resource for the newly diagnosed , or even someone like me , who has been in treatment for two years with metastatic breast cancer the book is not only medically informative on all counts , it also offers the personal side to dealing with the disease , including how to dress , eat and care for yourself in the midst of treatment two thumbs up dr kaelin ! t g \( lompoc , ca
i 've been working with this book \( with children \) for many years and have just bought my fifth copy \( as they seem to 'disappear' whenever i loan them to children to take home i suspect they love them too much to part with them for good ! \) the idea of reality being what we 're used to it being \( not rather what it has to be everywhere \) , as well as the hilarity of the situation the people of the story are faced with is just delightful it is an excellent resource of rich vocabulary and expression , and the drawings are believable and at the same time jaw dropping highly recommended to all ages , especially preschool through the lower grades
i bought this to read to my five year old son i had to stop reading at times because he was laughing so much it is silly and fun to read i would recommend this to anyone who has little ones it is very entertaining and lots to see
i recently purchased this book , again , for my grandchildren my daughters and nephew still remember this book they loved it and we read it many , many times together it is the perfect age level for my 7 yr old grandson , but a little long for the 4 year old we usually just talk the book because he loves the illustrations i am an artist myself and i just love the artwork after the first reading of the book , it transferred over to the dinner table what would happen if we had a flood of green beans \? a funny , silly and wonderful book
i read this to 7 and 8 year olds in a second grade class i had to explain some of the words , but the children enjoyed hearing and seeing the book the illustrations are helpful , i dont think it would stand up to re reading to the same class , but it was a funny diversion between more serious and longer books
this is a funny book , with a very unusual perspective on the weather we bought it because our family loves the writer 's other book animals should definately not wear clothing which we much prefer to this one
this book is such a fun adventure ! the pictures will have any child laughing and enjoying this book this is such a clever book in having a child wanting to read they will remember having a great time of fun with very happy funny moments in this book
i have had the pleasure to enjoy this book from two different perspectives first as a child and now as a parent reading to my child this book is wonderful ! the story and illustrations are captivating for both young and old the town and people of chewandswallow are just as real as they were over 20 years ago ! this book is a must for anyone with children and even for those who are young at heart
this is a wonderful story , as a teacher i read it with my third grade students and now as a mom i read it to my 3 1 2 tear old son he loves the story as much as they did ! ! !
just as wonderful as the first time i read it as a child ! what a wonderful gift to pass on to your children it is now a frequent bedtime request of my 3 year old
once again a great book from nicholas sparks , i 've read them all , and nicholas is always true to what would happen in real life he does n't write about fairytales its all true to what happens in real life this was a moving story of what true love is , and allowing another to be happy he gave a small window into what it must be like for those serving our country overseas and did n't make it a rosey story that makes the world look perfect definitely a sad story but one that leaves you inspired to hope , that you could do the same for someone that you loved that much if you are looking for the fairytale ending , this book is n't for you , but if you want a story that you could actually see happening its amazing i look forward to his next book
i would say this is one of my favorite nicholas sparks novels it is a thought provoking and more true to life story than most if you want a happily ever after story than you might want to read something else , but i say you 're missing out granted the book did n't have an ending like we might expect or hope , but it could n't really have ended any other way or i would have been disappointed with the person that john became in this story besides , there could be a sequel
i 've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks , and i could n't wait to read dear john well , there was no reason to rush it starts out okay , but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him , instead of just pouting over her for most the book
i'm not much of a reader but i love love loved this book it is inspiring and show what true love really is
i would have to say this is one of my favorites ! ! i have read all of nicholas sparks books and while message in a bottle will always be my favorite , this runs a close second along with a walk to remember \)
i have all of nicholas sparks novels , and i can honestly say that this one left much to be desired i have also raved about nicholas sparks' works to everyone however , i do n't have much to rave about this time the book was too predictable although i have often figured out other story lines written by sparks , but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had i am disappointed in the book and hope to see that nicholas sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines hopefully he can find time \( outside of coaching track \) to write another wonderful novel such as the notebook , message in a bottle , the wedding , and the list goes on \( but stops at dear john \)
i have been a nicholas sparks fan and i was very disappointed with this book too predictable , very depressing
dear john is an amazing book the book is able to relate to military relationships and how distance can change a relationship this book is going to be tear jerker but its worth all the tears
this is a wonderful book rolfe humphries did a magnificent job of making this philosophical poet relevant to us in the 20th the translation is eminently readable and at times reaches heights of beauty that does the great roman epicurean justice i discovered humphries' lucretius 20 years ago i 've found no other translation to be as accessible or as beautiful it 's been a consolation to me often in the last two decades and i'm sure it will continue to be in the future lucretius has much to say to us and we owe rolfe humphries a lot for giving him to us in a translation that manages to be both profound and charming at the same time
this book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market unless you have big bucks and level ii quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky in the trading parlance , i wish i had a short position on this book at its current price , and could cover my short at the current used price ! save your money
good book , nice conditio

i read kozol to actually be amused it saddens me to think that colleges force students to read books like these young minds take this at face value i am a native new yorker , from brooklyn my parents were working class , and we had no extras what i hate most about kozol is his obvious white guilt he never talks about personal responsibility it is just the city not taking care of the poor and needy that is the problem with most liberals , they offer opinions , work on the emotions of people , and never offer solutions when mayor giuliani wanted welfare workers to work , ie pick up leaves in the park , there was a great outcry well , when i was in college , i worked cleaning up after horses just to pay for part of tuition , and i waited tables , etc why should they not work if they are getting a check \? he also talks about how the suburbs spent more money per child in the school system yet he never mentions what those parents in the suburbs spent each year on taxes there is a lot more i could write , but i would be here all day take it from a native new yorker who worked as a teacher in the south bronx he plays on your feelings , but in the end , by portraying poor people as victims he gives people a way to blame the system , and insults every hardworking person who has improved his or her life
i first picked this up in college in my first sociology class i did n't know what to think of the book was this supposed to be a textbook for the class , or a nonfiction novel \? well , it did n't take long for me to get hooked on kozal and everything he 's written since amazing grace is very powerful and the most basic level it introduces the reader to children directly affected by poverty and shows you in no uncertain way how their socio economic status cripples their ability to learn and flourish into adults it does n't mence words , so be ready to get a little emotional when reading this if you have any interest in class and education , you have to read kozal if you 're going to read any kozal , you have to start here
jonathan kozol is a national treasure , and his amazing grace is a beautiful addition to his portfolio it has inspired my own writing about the importance of uplifting the south bronx , a place that i well remember from visiting my grandparents there in the late 60s
jonathan kozol 's amazing grace is an enlightening , non fiction account of life in the south bronx to write this book , kozol visited to the area hundreds of times , speaking with and establishing relationships with residents as well as exploring , and getting to know the area himself the final product is a compilation of conversations with some amazing people and his own thoughts and reflections , beautifully woven together this book addresses numerous social issues effecting new york 's poorest areas including violence , poverty , unemployment , drug addiction , hiv aids , inadequate schools , orphaned children , and deplorable living conditions
amazing grace is an amazing book by jonathan kozol that portrays the impoverished life of thousands in the ghettoes of new york city it is a nonfiction book where kozol goes into extremely poor areas of brooklyn to interview several people who must live that filthy life everyday kozol uses theses interviews to prove his point that the government is at fault for the horrifying conditions that many people in america live in he uses many people 's situations as examples to prove that the government does not do enough to help these people live kozol dives into topics such as aids , asthma , homicide , education , drugs , and many more kozol effectively appeals to the readers pathos , ethos , and logos because it allows him to connect with the reader , and allows the reader to adopt kozol 's concept that the government is to blame for the ridiculous living conditions in new york ghettoes
this book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation the author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in new york 's ghettos the fierce images of rat infested homes , and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children 's point of view to the political views of the country also presenting an array of diverse issues such as aids , drugs , underage prostitution , death , motives based in moral , religious beliefs , and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood numerous quotes and examples are given in the book , but one that particularly struck me was when kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds , not many well , to tell the truth , not any who are happy for more than one day no ! not for one day for 15 minutes not any that 's no lie \( 212 \) to honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and i'm sure for many others as well by using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support examples such as unsanitary hospitals , toxic incinerators , closet sized school rooms , and shabby , less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government 's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people but once again kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial he provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives it seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets while reading , it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction , though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were
amazing grace by jonathan kozol is an enlightening book it is very interesting and well written it portrays the lives of poor people and innocent children living in the inner cities of new york city the book focused on mature and complex topics such as homicide , the aids virus , drug use , and religion kozol makes a strong argument that life in the inner cities is unsafe for children he argues that children 's schools and homes are inadequate and unacceptable he also discusses the faults of the government , such as how it 's decisions help the rich and hinder the poor kozol addresses issues about hospital services for the poor regarding money deficiencies and discrimination kozol interviews several people who explain how they feel mistreated and unwanted by the upper class white society they feel like burdens , and believe that the white people would be happy if the poor left the city it is amazing to see that in spite of their suffering many poor inner city people are very religious and have very strong faith in god and heaven amazing grace open 's one 's eyes to the less fortunate , and reminds us to be thankful for all that we have and to enjoy life even when things do not look great overall amazing grace was a very good book , inspiring and interesting , a good read
before reading jonathan kozol 's amazing grace , i always thought the south bronx was what was happenin' according to krs one 's song south bronx unfortunately unlike the upbeat tempo and rhythm of this song , this non fiction compilation of stories of the south bronx is a place full of peril , hatred , and abandonment
the biggest ones , the water rats , come out of the bronx river at four p m or five p m , when it 's beginning to get dark , you see them coming out in hordes very large rats you see them right here in the street outside our building i do n't like to see them i feel nausea when i see them
i guess what i find funny is that some of the other reviewers say this book does not help having read the book i am really quite taken aback
when i first read this book , it really reinforced the concepts of investing
it is a book that you have to read if you want to know how a very succesful make it
when peter s lynch speaks , wise investors will listen this book covers the famous fund manager 's career at the helm of fidelity magellan from 1977 to '90 , and post career into '92 it 's far more introspective than one up on wall street and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose for example , there is n't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former my belief is that the reader would do best by reading one up on wall street first and follow up with this title , as its the newer of the two , regardless
peter lynch 's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success i used to believe things i read in books because a good publisher like simon and schuster would publish it i counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling i also avoided reading tealeaves like drawing trendlines on what i was actually concerned about the price of the stock ! now i make a living reading tealeaves and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up
if you 're just starting out in stocks and investing this is a good book it tells you to know your stocks , to do your homework when you buy stocks and how to pick good stocks it gives you some good places to start and it also gives you some history on peter lynch
peter lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind one drawback is that mr lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally for example , asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique mr lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock however , it 's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools , not to mention personal genius
i am very new at the investing game , and pretty much know what your average couch potato does
i bought this cd storybook in beijing it 's much more expensive than my anticipation but the cover of this book is very beautiful , it 's good designed it 's very easy to attract children 's eyes , and easier to attract the eyes of teenagers who have a kid 's heart just like me !
i saw this book in beijing , xidan and i loved it very much , but i did n't have got enough money that time after a few days , my uncle came to see me in the hotel and gave me this as a gift ! i was so happy ! the stories of the princesses are pretty good , and the cd and the book is good to my english study
this is the second disney 4 in 1 audio storybook i purchased for my two kids \( first being the lion king , the little mermaid , toy story , aladdin \) we absolutely love both these books ! all the four stories have beautiful illustrations and the print is large and easy to read the audio cd is fun to listen to , with lots of animations the pages are of great quality that should suit kids' rough handling of the book and page turning
this book is funny because of the writers comments mostly , although there are a few times where you will be wondering how our parents or grandparents survived a lot of the time , i found myself standing up for the old fashioned advice because honestly , a lot of it made sense when you think about the era for example , they still teach us that newspaper can help with delivering a baby if there are not better materials available
i absolutely loved james lileks' two previous books and found them achingly funny , but like several other reviewers , i found mommy knows worst to be tinged with sadness at times yes , it was very funny , but on the other hand i ended up feeling so sorry for mothers that actually followed this kind of advice \( like my mother \) and kids who were subjected to it \( like me \) that it tempered my enjoyment somewhat
parents with a sense of humor remaining about their profession will appreciate mommy knows worst highlights from the golden age of bad parenting advice , which gathers past parenting neuroses from the 1940s and 50s from 'delicious' baby laxatives to boiling baby 's milk , mommy knows worst is filled with hilarious moments and fine vintage illustrations from the times
i love the lileks books , but this one actually left me feeling a little sad for children who were raised this way \( i'm still giving it 4 stars because it 's well done and as well written as ever \)
i love exploring james lilek 's website and this book is just more of his wackiness a majority of the items were way before my time but i did note my not so beloved carseat in there nothing like being hooked to the front seat with some metal tubing and a thin plastic strap
i read james lileks' blog all the time this book was good for a concentrated does of humor
i laughed until i cried when reading some of these great old time ads i even made my pets upset by laughing out loud so much it was a great book on what not to do in parenting it 's a wonder any of us survived
if you already have kids , this book will seem funny , but mean spirited to all the good intentioned parents from a bygone era if you have n't already gone to the bathroom , you will have an accident from laughing so hard it starts funny and stays funny there are really long reprinted articles that make you want to skip ahead to the funny parts , but read through everything for a unique insight into the world where you have to be 18 to smoke , 21 to drink , pass a test to recieve a license to drive , and obtain permission from the neighborhood association before you can build a deck on your own property yet anyone can spit a babe into the harsh , cruel world with only the advice of family members and current child rearing philosophies from our so called experts
i am 45 years old and recently told my kids that in my day , infants did n't have car seats or booster seats \( or even seat belts ! \) they asked in disbelief , where did you go in the car \? i said , nana and pop just laid me on the floor of the car this book proved to my kids that i was telling the truth about the dangers kids and babies lived through back then and all the jaw droppingly unbelievably bad advice mothers were given
when i was eleven years old my father started to sexually abuse me when i was fourteen my half brother sexually abused me i have remember the abuses every single day for 37 years never forgetting for a moment what happened to me up until seven years ago i played the dutiful daughter in our happy little home until i finally got the guts to confront my father did he deny it no , he admitted it when i asked my older sister if our father \( actually her step father \) had abused her she , too , said that she had remembered it everyday since the age of seven our father admitted to that , too when i confronted my brother about the abuse , he admitted it too but did i announce to the world every sick detail that happened to me did i cut myself off completely from my family no but at least i did n't have to pretend anymore that my father was this upstanding person now i did n't have to come up with lame excuses when i did n't go to family functions did it affect me yes it did
this is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened it does not deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse \( the author explicitly states this on many occasions \) and the reviewer who suggested that this is a terrific book if you are child molester probably \( i guess \) did n't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy
a good \( though heavy \) read for anyone exposed to recovered memories it is important to remember that recovered memories can feel as real and vivid as true memories this book takes a huge amount of information and manages to put it in one place other reviews have pointed out the non objectivity and the seeming need for stronger editing , but that is a nearly impossible task to ask of mark , as directly affected as he was by this tragic movement
those so called professionals of the cottage industry called childhood sexual abuse should be forced to read this book before lunging foward to save more kids the witch hunt we 've seen in this nation makes salem look like a tea party beautifully written , well researched , heartbreakingly fair the enemies of critical thought and careful observation will hate this book
this book was real help to get out of the hell my family has been in since falsely accused of abuse the irresponisible therapists have no idea the pain they have caused
this book fails both as a history or analysis of yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of tito the first few chapters , which contain an overly compressed historical review of the south slavs from the middle ages to the twentieth century , contain factual , spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable for example , west claims that the leader of the 1573 croat peasant revolt was donja stubica that was actually the name of the village in which it started he claims that in 1871 the croat revolutionary eugen kvaternik led an armed assault on the serbs , when in fact kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the habsburg monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves serbs he persistently misspells the surname of the great serbian linguist and writer vuk karadzic as `karadjic' and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text west basically argues that the problems in yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the middle ages , and reduces the wars which ensued after yugoslavia 's collapse to religious conflicts he also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the serbs , croats or bosnian muslims rather , he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions , thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between `nation' and `ethnicity , ' among other things he focuses extensive attention and invective , perhaps rightfully , to the ww2 croatian ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the croatian catholic church during this period on the other hand , he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the serbian chetniks during the same period even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the serbian orthodox church was never clearly associated with great serb nationalism or with the chetniks one of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on world war ii the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the 1990s this is only true to a certain extent , but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital 40 ensuing years in fact , at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in croatian and serbian newspapers during the late 1980s and early 1990s which speak of events from 50 , 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday west 's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to \( rather outrageously \) twice refer to the kosovo albanians as `shiptars' among non albanians , this is a racial epithet , not a neutral descriptive term tito , the central figure in this book , fares little better although west has a nostalgically favorable view of tito , he offers no new insights into yugoslavia 's long time president and strongman , only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies , memoirs and histories , both favorable and critical often he provides details on completely trivial matters from tito 's life , at one point even citing actor richard burton 's impressions of tito and his wife aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in yugoslavia , there is little of interest here reading west 's book is a colossal waste of time my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library , peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on tito , ww2 and the ustasha terror and the former yugoslavia in general
this book contains absolutely one of the best explanations of the current balkan fiasco while dwelling on tito , west also explains the ethnic disputes that have torn apart yugoslavia west 's coverage of the ustasha is particularly accurate and enlightening
i did not buy this book for the designs nobody should , and they are not the point of the book anyhow i bought it to review the technical information for my knitting classes , which according to some other knitting teachers , was first rate and unbiased , in this book
i only just picked up a copy of this book the other day , but already it 's having a profound effect on the way i look at my knitting
for several years i 've been told by friends that i ought to lay hands on a copy of this book , before it goes out of print when i finally found one and spent an evening reading it , i discovered why there is such a buzz about the book
having read the partly cloudy patriot first , i loved this book because it invited me to learn more about the author and her life and in that respect , the book is very good well written and full of vowell 's characteristic wit i would not , however , recommend it as a first taste of sarah vowell i think it 's funnier and more interesting once you 're familiar with her style
take the cannoli was a wonderful mixture of essays that was throughly enjoyable as i have become used to with sarah vowell , her family , her relationship with her twin sister , her friends , her thoughts on the world in which she lives , her love for history , and the challenges of her everyday life flow through many of these essays , interconnecting them in ways that you do not expect the essays in take the cannoli are consistently good , often made me laugh out loud , and in some cases changed my perspective on a particular subject although i did n't always agree with her , i certainly appreciated her passion
sarah vowell is one of america 's best writers in the genre of humor personally , having read both sedaris and rakoff , two other fantastic humorists , i am rather partial to vowell take the cannoli seems to demonstrate her ability to both make us think and laugh it seems that in most of her essays , i learn about as much as i laugh personally , i thought the title essay was extremely well done and is deserving of much praise from the literary community
nice collection of random essays about american life blends the personal with the larger cultural and historical elements into a very palatable literary malt a little too short of a book the title essay \( take the cannoli \) was my favorite
though she 's known to many as a voice on npr 's this american life and to many more \( even if they do n't realize it \) as the voice of violet in the hit pixar film the incredibles , i mainly came to know her through her written works having read her book the partly cloudy patriot and loving the unique way she blends history , pop culture and humor with autobiography , i could n't resist sarah vowell 's essay collection take the cannoli to put it mildly , i was impressed even though many of these pieces were delivered on the radio , they translate to book form without a hint of strain whereas a book written by a comedian like george carlin often comes off as a clumsily assembled blog , ms vowell takes the time to put her thoughts down with clarity , and therefore her ideas and personality shine through
what i find most admirable in sarah vowell 's work is the way it illuminates what 's possible in essay writing while her work is often well researched , she is not writing journalism exactly , nor is she writing analysis though she 's unafraid of pulling a quotation from nick carraway , huck , or the corleones into any discussion nor , despite the strong presence of her own voice , is she writing a pure personal essay her most successful work defies categorization simply by using whatever comes in handy at the moment the subtitle stories form the new world suggests the loose theme of these essays , the bred in the bones idealism of this country that any sensible person resists and feels nonetheless besides being someone worth spending time with , sarah vowell creates prose like clear , cool water she speaks through words , not into them , and that is a too rare phenomenon among essayists
i love this woman ! she cannot be any better of a writer , she keeps her stories short and clever telling nothing but the truth ! this is yet another book that i never wanted to put down because it was just that great !
i may be somewhat biased in my review because sarah vowell is my insperation the short stories of her life are classis and fun they are so easy to identify with and the cover real issues things that can be entertaing yet insightfull
one of the greatest poets ever in my opinion reading his poems as oposed to listning to them on a album is a vastly differnet experiences his words touch me like no other this book is absolutly amazing , especially reading the things the dead never played jack o roses the seventh section of terrapin station is the most beautiful thing iever read \( you can hear hunter sing it by going to the hunter archive at dead net everyone should read this , and for the few that really get it , it will be a transcendant experinece
you need to buy this book you wont regret it its got the most amazing lyrics poems youll ever read ! ! robert hunter could possibly be the best lyricist of all time
and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung would you hear my voice come through the music would you hold it near as it were your own \? ' part of the experience of a grateful dead concert \( and now the other ones , ratdog , phil lesh and friends , and mickey hart 's band \) was listening to the words of robert hunter dance and twirl in your head hunter probably is n't the greatest american poet of the second half of the 20th century , but he does know how to turn a phrase , borrow a line , and mix a metaphor and his strange mix of phrases went well with the strange mix of american music written by the late jerry garcia box of rain is a must reference for anyone interested in the lyrical end of rock and roll the book will clear up many an on going debate on just what jerry was singing all those nights so long ago and for all those people who ca n't understand why the grateful dead was so successful , this book will let you in on part of the secret 'if you get confused , just listen to the music play
hunter 's words , the inspiration , soul , and backbone of the grateful 's dead 's songs , are here collected in all their subtle grace his songs read like poems , and his poems burst like songs vital reading for dead heads and poetry lovers alike
wow ! this is an amazing book featuring the lyrics of robert hunter \( primary lyricist of the grateful dead \) helps with those totally un understandable \( is this even a word \? \) lyrics but more importantly is a reflection on a remarkable career including personal notes and non dead songs hunter 's work s truly wonderful amp i would even be willing to bet non deadheads would enjoy this book for its poetic values peace amp of course enjoy
i have to admit to a great deal of personal bias here because i am a lifelong deadhead so it stands to reason that my opinions towards hunter may be a bit coloured and clouded \( pun possibly intended \) but this is a wonderful collection of lyrics hunter is a true poet whose song lyrics deserve to live and breathe in printed form i always felt there was a poetry to rock lyrics bob dylan , lou reed , jim morrison , richard hell et al robert hunter also deserves to be recognized on that list of rock poet laureates beautiful lyrics like box of rain and ripple take on a new life when read from the page it gives one the chance to see how good the use of language actually was terrapin is a tour de force epic of rock poetry and almost everything from american beauty and workingmans dead ring out as great poetry while there is some average , weaker material as well , this gives hunter a chance to earn acknowledgment for the fine poet that he is the grateful dead would never have achieved their legendary status without the mystical , magical lyric ability of robert hunter this book is a treasure trove that deserves a place next to the dylan lyric book from 62 85 and the collection of lyrics put out by lou reed as well
hunter 's lyrics for the dead sing alone , without music he 's the best living poet in the enlish language maybe the greatest ever but geez , bob , stop trying to re write terrapin ! sometimes a writer gets too close to his work to see it well the first version is perfect , man
anne lamott is amazing ! her metaphor for writing and for life may be a little irreverent at times , but she tells it like it is the unexpected moments of humor delight us while opening us to her keen insights on life a manual on writing , a daily meditation , and a joyful read , bird by bird reaches us on many levels
most of the time , how to write books are either reeeeally touchy feely , or completely technical i get annoyed about books like that because writing is a combination of both so i was n't convinced i 'd much care for this book , which leans toward the touchy feely i was not expecting to find touchy feely with a hint of tough love
whenever i feel like everything i 've ever written is crap , i pick up bird by bird writing crap , as ms lamott tells us , is the first step toward writing well william zinser 's on writing well is a more comprehensive text on the subject , but lamott 's bird by bird always inspires me to go back to work on the story if you love to write , get the book
this is one of the books that i will keep and re read very well written and inspiring i loved it ! ! made me want to write and made me feel that i could actually write something worth reading
i found this book very depressing anne lamott 's constant self deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well i know she is doing it to show that she 's human just like the rest of us , but i think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets \( saying the 9 year old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman , etc \) despite what she says about how you should n't do that it 's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models , it gets to you
if you 're too hard on yourself as a writer , this book is definitely for you even if you 're not , this book will encourage , inspire , and jumpstart your writing lamott is funny and insightful , but what i love is that she pushes you to be gentle with yourself as a writer \( writers tend to be overly critical and pessimistic about their work \) if you 're ever faced with writer 's block , this book is a must have you 'll laugh your way back to the page
well , either way , ann lamott has written a simply put and beautifully thought out tome on wiritng not how to write , but how to get your gluteus on a chair and fight through all of your inner and outer demons and put yourself on the pages to take a bold step forward and reveal to the world who you really are
the big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex few of us ever wake up to the mental prison cells that society has put us in and fewer still escape anne lamott 's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating once you get past this junk , you begin to see you do n't really need books telling you how to write at all you just need to write
what a great book ! 420 pages , hardback , and every single page is worth reading , not one page is boring you just want to keep reading and keep turning pages !
i 've read quite a few of nora roberts 's books and this was the only one on which i had the complete 'wowzer' reaction i mean , seriously wow this is a book full of content , with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks , reading and rereading it to get it all ms roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the olympic rain forest the characters are likable , and believable , and most certainly not your average roberts book livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as noah could be a persistent annoyance and readers will find themselves grieving for julie macbride along with jamie , rob , val , david and livvy herself and there 's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling
when i started reading river 's end , it reminded me of a remake of the o j simpson murder it is a story centered on a little 4 year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father years pass by and the story unravels olivia 's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy written in the ingenious nora roberts style i have grown to truly enjoy , this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the olympic rain forest through olivia 's eyes i guessed the villain about 1 2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as i could never be 100 sure i was correct i would highly recommend this book to everyone
in river's end , nora roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years a story of hollywood 's glamour gone astray , and the young girl who survived it but this is n't a typical plot by any means , not with roberts' doing the writing she guarantees many unexpected events along the way !
some may not consider this one of her best , indeed , it is n't listed as a fav anywhere , but it had enough nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything i could there after
my first nora roberts' book with only be persistent did i complete the book found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
i could n't put this book down it was so good it was such a surprise because by reading the inside cover it does n't sound at all good but i gave it a try and i'm glad i did it 's definatly become one of my favorites this year the story comes alive for you
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger , them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning , and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it , but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of ms roberts
the books are in fine condition my problem is with amazon !
i suspect not many younger sf readers really get heinlein you really have to be an early phase baby boomer , one of those \( like me \) who got hooked on his juveniles in the early `50s , when rolling roads and unlimited solar power and a working lunar colony seemed not only possible but very likely those future history stories were the stuff of dreams for geeks of my generation personally , i had every intention of being the staff archaeologist on the first flight to mars ah , well
my story regarding the way i encountered this book may quite differ from other reviewers' experiences i came by this book randomly my first year of high school when my english teacher one day forced us to choose a book displayed in class to read immediately oh , these long gone years of high school so this was the book i ended up with i honestly did n't know what to expect , other than i highly doubted i would end up liking this science fiction type of story this was not my usual cup of tea nevertheless , being the type of person who must finish a book always , regardless of if i enjoy it or not , i started reading the book , and before i knew it , i had concluded it although i may not disagree that starting elsewhere may be of great help , i do like to share the fact that i was one of these random pickers and in this case , it did not turn out disastrous as many may gather to be the case or at least , it was not nearly as bad as one could anticipate for this kind of novel , since i fully agree that for science fiction works , one may find himself completely lost had he not first visited the earlier works i allowed myself to be open minded as i read the novel , allowing my mind to create perceptions and concepts i was not used to dealing with in the past since my exposure to science fiction was practically non existent i believe this approach helped me greatly in enjoying the book , and i quite enjoyed doing so i found this book very entertaining , and given my usual taste in novels , very different from the rest of my book collection this is something i am greatful for , since i'm often up for new experiences , and i will be honest in saying that after reading this book , it has opened up the doors to the possibility of my reading more , if not all , heinlein accomplishments
there was hardly any mention of pixel the cat , it was alot of dialog , tried to resemble a fast paced action book , but i found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while for a female i like action and for the plot to move along there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging , and multiple partner sex i felt like the over tone to the book was well ok we all have alot of sex with lots of different people in the future it was too focused on that i liked stranger in a strange land alot better by the time i was through with this book i kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page
first the good news this book contains some of heinlein 's most interesting speculations , some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas \( there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls , and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an x rating \) \) , some of his most interesting characters \( several of them new , and many old , such as lazarus long and jubal harshaw \) , and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of the world as myth heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books , such as glory road , stranger in a strange land , and the number of the beast , that are not a part of his future history series , by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe , or multiverse theory , that was discovered by mathematician dr jake burroughs in the number of the beast it 's a brilliant concept that unifies heinlein 's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality
excellent heinlein i re read this on my journey back from denver this weekend it is the mid point between the moon is a harsh mistress and to sail beyond the sunset , two of heinlein 's best this is not a standalone book , and would hardly make sense without at least reading the moon is a harsh mistress , heinlein 's best book , imho , and one of the finest pieces of science fiction ever published anywhere by anyone
the first two thirds of this book are great a great heinlein thriller , with action and mystery then it just gets weird almost as if douglas adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off
this book is terrible rah takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into well , i do n't quite know what halfway through the book , it seems as though he had set it down for several years , came back to it to finish it off , but had nothing but nonsense on the brain i 've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before , but this book absolutely takes the cake it 's not even my book and i threw it in the trash so it wo n't waste another person 's time ever again
heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention unfortunately , these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein 's final books we are also treated to some of heinlein 's stock characters , dirty old men , horny female computers , naked adolescent girls , and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed as if this is n't enough , heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing in spite of all their cameo appearances , this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout heinlein 's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people , especially boys this novel , as well as most of heinlein 's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption
first off , starship troopers is one of my top ten books period well done mister heinlein
the principles in the book 'on becoming a person' are good for anyone who loves all ideas on the free individual scientists who like theories of personality must know this book
i found this book a lot more enjoyable than most other psychotherapy books i 've read and made getting through my psychotherapy class a lot easie
this is carl rogers' classic and a must read for everyone interested in getting real with themselves the critic who edited this version indicates very successfully that there are important parallels between carl rogers and ralph waldo emerson this makes rogers' philosophy and psychotherapeutic approach a truly american one , one that places the individual in the supreme seat of ultimate authority over his her own experience and existence the main message that rogers develops from many different angles is this one there is no beast in man , and therefore there is also no need to fear one 's innermost thoughts , feelings , longings and desires there is only man in man this was surely a revolutionary message at the time , and remains to be revolutionary to this day , as so many modern day religionists cling to the idea of man 's innate badness rogers most certainly debunks that destructive religious heritage in his work this book is a pleasure to read it is written in very simple , yet precise language and goes down like honey

i was given this book in 1973 when i was a senior in college and wished to attend graduate school in clinical psychology the book transformed me i went from page to page recognizing that roger 's spoke directly to me and the way i experienced my relationship with my inner self and soul this book review is written with the purpose of encouraging others to read this masterpiece of psychological theory all psychiatrists , psychologists , counselors , and social workers should be intimately familiar with rogers and his concepts
i read this book as a student in high school i was dissatisfied with the way my education was going science and math were stressed and everything felt like a mold my life lacked a human side , and i could not be myself , i had to be what my teachers wanted me to be reading this book helped to change all of that rogers shows a way to be human , rather than the machine that the scientific community stresses , but he does this in a scientific manner so it has merit within the scientific community his theories for education are also amazing and have helped me to shape my own college education
rogers writes this book on what seems to be an unsure basis about his theories on human psychology which i find to be very accurate , albeit ignored theories from socrates , descartes , and sartes his theories , though accidental , seem to come from the evolution of the human being , the mystique of free will , and the pattern of thought are all described in this boo
as a student , the writings of carl rogers changed my life and view of therapy i stopped worrying about techniques and other psychological constructs such the id and ego after reading carl roger 's writings , i started to focus on the person , client , and therapeutic relationship every person who is considering entering the counseling or therapy profession must read carl rogers i have had the honor of hearing and seeing carl lecture and demonstrate what he believed in vivo carl rogers will go down in history one person who truly changed counseling and therapy
david hume , who perhaps more than any other philosopher raised questions about our ordinary understanding of the world after having made his long argument showing how our ordinary understanding of causation could not be logically proven nonetheless said , when i leave the room , i leave by the door and not by the window
this book deserves to be read and re read this is a powerful , fascinating and in the end surprisingly moving book
what 's with the moron from texas who reviewed this book while admiting that he or she did n't read the book \? \? \? geez
this book blew my mind the writing is clear and the ideas are exciting i thought it would be my summer read but i was done in a few weeks i could n't put it down the book gives weight to the psychological , historical , philisophical and sociological aspects of the subject in a balanced and well presented format it is a delightful read complex without being dry for a minute i highly recommend this book
there are millions of books out there offering to seduce you or browbeat you toward a particular belief system , but for the thoughtful philosophers , the nervous doubters , the nonbelievers \( both lost and found \) , and evangelical athiests , there are very few well written , even handed , inspiring texts jennifer hecht deserves a wreath of laurels for creating an exciting , readable , joyous work that belongs in the home of every open minded , rational , seeker of enlightenment this book should have its own section in bookstores
reading the title and description of this book , i was excited about reading it i found the writing not up to the task ! despite having a great deal of interest in the subject , after scanning the book i decided not to read it
jennifer hecht has written a courageous book in the face of the current groundswell of fundamentalist thinking it is a very thoroughly documented history of some of the greatest thinkers in every era she also sites many lesser known sages and provides us plenty of examples to support her argument she uses a very personal sometimes humorous style that makes this tome compelling throughout the whole book for those in need of a poignant quote hecht provides them routinely in every chapter
superb scholarship in an easy to read format the author , jennifer hecht , is fully capable of recapitulating the salient pericopes
i happened on this book in a bookstore last fall it gave me a whole new way of looking at things because it presents the history of doubt \( and heresy \) as a long tradition worthy of admiration
jill briscoe is fantastic this book is grounded in the bible and gets to the heart of key areas that are vital to your christian walk not an anemic gloss over , nor a health and wealth god as geanie recipe book jill challenges the reader to make real grown up christian decisions about truly living your life for christ , but does it in a wonderfully humble and loving style with plenty of scripture and real life examples , it is one of those books that are easy and enjoyable to read , but not a quick read because it is constantly prayer and thought provoking
in a world where the dead rule , a band of the living take refuge in a prison seems a little too easy , but what could go wrong do n't worry about the dead ones it 's the living prisoners you need to watch out for when hershel opened that door and i turned the page my jaw dropped to the floor totally was n't expecting it volume 3 is the best so far
like many readers , i 've been an on again off again comicbook fan for many years in the last couple of years \( since the year 2000 \) i 've returned to the fold , this time taking advantage of the many top quality graphic novels out there , and robert kirkman 's walking dead was one of the titles most frequently recommended to me since i started this reading spree it lives up to the hype
i bought this because im a zombie fan i wish i saved my money the main character is a guy who is a cop and his wife is carrying some other guys baby when they actually stop jumping in and out of bed with each other the battles with the zombies is quit boring and of all places to build a new life they try to do it in a prison how stupid less sex and more action this story desperately needs rent a good zombie movie with your ten bucks instead of buying this garbage
i 've watched and read an unreal amount of zombie movies , comic books and stories and robert kirkman has one upped them all ! an amazing tale of survival and chaos
excellent story and artwork the author really put some thought into the plotline he did a great job of using the overall concept to examine other societal issues in a fresh way if you are a fan of the zombie genre at all , then you are sure to enjoy this book
safety beind bars is the third collected volume of robert kirikman 's excellent the walking dead comic book series from image comics this volume collects issues 13 through 18 and it continues that journey and travails of surviving in a world overrun by the undead as the tagline of the books proclaim , in a world ruled by the dead we are forced to finally start living this is so true in safety behind bars as kirkman and returning artist charlie adlard tell the story of rick grimes and his band of survivors as they come across what they think will be their salvation from the threat of the hungry dead an abandoned prison complex
robert kirkman , the walking dead safety behind bars \( image , 2005 \)
rick grimes and the group of survivors he leads have found yet another place where they hope to live and start life anew , a deserted prison while it seems to be a secure location , cleaning out the walking dead inside proves a monumental task , and the discovery of surviving prisoners makes the group grow by four more however the group is far from safe , as a threat from within begins killing them one by one it is one of the surviving inmates , or one of the group \? more twists and turns in what has become one of the best comics around today highest recommendation
back before the zombie apocalypse swept the earth , people were dying to get out of prison
the best of the zombie movie genre \( that is to say , romero 's films \) usually have had a thing or two to say about human nature robert kirkman has been doing this to some extent in the walking dead all along , but perhaps more conscientiously with the third volume safety behind bars after the events of last volume , rick , lori and company find an abandoned prison which , ironically , is the perfect place to hide out from the dead wandering the world but there are still a few human prisoners , and while they seem a reasonable lot , it soon becomes clear that even when the dead roam outside , and humanity is on the ropes , a serial killer still feels free to act on his sick desires
the book is well sectioned into a broad , comprehensive range of topics from the war , technology , management , culture , world trade , etc i found his approach to setting up in the us interesting \( very non japanese \)
hi everyone , i have just completed this book and found it not only an interesting one but a necessarry one to be read by any preson who is thinking to become a sucessful manager this book is the journy of akio morita and sony together
i wavered awhile between three stars and two stars , because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as sony and akio morita seem to deserve at least three however , in the end , the book 's errors just piled too high it opens well , with the story of sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half wrecked department store just after world war ii , to becoming one of the world 's great companies this is a fascinating and inspiring story , and morita tells it with flair
i ca n't put it down until i finished it within 2 days i was kind of embarrassed by mr akio 's observation about china , but it is quite honest and down to earth we chinese should learn a lot from japan 's rising experiences from this book , we can learn how to deal with the free world , how to improve the quality of our products , how to simply be open minded thanks for mr akio and his great book
this book is written by mr akio morita , the man behind the corporate giant sony corporation he was a visionary and dreamer who not just dreamed but also made it possible let 's not forget , the sony corporation was founded at the backdrop of nuclear attack on japan by the united states but he was never jealous of america instead he was very much influenced by the progress of us he always tried to replicate the progress of us by closely watching the american business model the book is full of anecdotes about the japanese lifestyle , his thoughts on management and his association with sony so , just read
of my 3 favorite books , this is one of them made in japan is part autobiography , history , economics , japanese culture and business all rolled in to one the writing style is one of the most comprehensible i 've ever read very interesting , insightful , and informative akio morita is a very cool guy , and he 's lead an interesting life if you like business , economics , or japanese culture , this book is definitely worth the read
made in japan gives us insight in to japanese working ethos , their dedication and vision it is a story of sony , a company that is world leader in many electronic and it products , told in simple manner by creator of sony mr akio morita coming from him , one has to believe every word of it it is fascinating to read and travel along , as the story progress , with a small seedling 's growth in to a big corporate giant that sony today is no brashness , no adoption of unfair means , no showing off its economic strength it is a plain simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded an interesting reading
what a great read ! bringing down the house is a superb story that reads like a fast paced action thriller , but the kicker is that everything in this story really happened once i started reading this story , i could n't put it down until the last page i truly believe that its a must have for any serious fan of gambling and or blackjack it will inspire and give hope to the hopeless blackjacker such as myself i doubt that you will be disappointed
this true story really takes you into the hair raising lifestyle of vegas , and then propels you into the blackjack world and the realities of getting caught at counting cards hell of a read , makes me want to learn to count cards
bringing down the house tells the story of kevin lewis and his teammates from the massachusetts institute of technology who formed a team to win millions from las vegas by counting cards at blackjack the story focuses on lewis and chronicles how he is brought into the group and becomes entranced by the excitement and the money
in the mid 1990s , a team of american science students took on the might of the las vegas casinos , and came home with millions of dollars hardworking engineering students during the week , they became high rolling gamblers by the weekend and proved that , in one game at least , the house does n't always win the game was blackjack , and the students were from the world renowned massachusetts institute of technology \( mit \) their audacious winnings marked the climax of an arms race between casino and player that began 40 years earlier with maths professor edward thorp he realized that the one feature of blackjack that made it different from other casino games also made it possible to beat the unique way blackjack was played , the odds were not always the same in every round after each hand is played , the used cards are put to one side , and not shuffled back into the deck they are effectively removed from the pool of available cards in the next round so in any given hand , the odds of getting an ace will decrease if an ace has been played in previous rounds aces are beneficial to the player , so having a smaller proportion of aces in the deck shifts the odds further in favour of the house previous gamblers had realized this fact , but no one had the insight to come up with a practical system to take advantage of this phenomenon
it 's a robin hood story of a group of math students from the mit ivory tower using their brains to get rich at las vegas giants' expenses i must say it is truly a page turner and if you were n't interested in blackjack before , you increase your chances of becoming looking back , the story is almost too clich , but if you immerse yourself without skepticism , you 'll will love it !
beating the odds in vegas is much harder than i thought leave it to a group of mit braniacs to figure it out this story is incredible so much deeper than the card counting i expected their system was incdedibly elaborate this is not a book you can read on your flight to lv and hope to gain an advantage this is about a system that was years in the making i m facinated by how successfully this system worked to the tune of millions in winnings
this book has spurred tv specials and recieved many rave reviews after getting sucked into one of the many tv specials talking about counting cards and beating vegas i decided to look into the issue and this book , as i had heard , was the `one' to read while reading the book i found that it was extremely hard to put down and that i essentially had goose bumps imagining the pure brilliance of these college kids
this is a fun , fun book mezrich opens the door to a world that some of us are unfamiliar with and it was a fascinating expose you will enjoy this book even if you do n't gamble and at just over 250 pages it is a quick read
this book is magnificent i found myself so encrossed in the story i am just amazed at how nora roberts can make you feel the romantic scenes with margo and josh were so powerful the passion , desire and love between the two of them was so strong you could only wish you had that type of love in a lifetime bravo nora you are magnificent
i have to say i love this book , i could not put it down !
this is my third trilogy by nora and so far so good i like margo , the main character and her relationship with josh she is fiesty and fun the friendship between the women is also nice to read about it will be interesting to find out if the dowry really does exist i look forward to learning more about the other two women , especially laura !
daring to dream is the first story in the dream trilogy it focuses on margo sullivan , the daughter of the templeton 's housekeeper margo 's best friends are her two sisters whose stories are told in the other books margo is beautiful and has always had plans to see the world and be famous
daring to dream is the first book in the dream trilogy an interesting tale about margo sullivan who had visions of grandeur but would n't let her dreams die she grew up in monterey , california in a mansion she was treated like a family member , but was actually the daughter of the housekeeper her mother tried to keep margo 's feet on the ground , but it did n't work she went on to have a successful modeling career until scandal ruined it and caused her to go bankrupt , but she continued to dream she retreats to her hometown and back into the friendship with kate and laura , her two childhood friends who grew up in the same house with her
daring to dream is the first book in this must read series i started it thinking i 'd read a few short chapters before calling it the night i was wrong could not put this book down and believe me i tried several times but just could n't do it i was tired at work the next day but a tiredness that was well worth it
i really enjoyed this book from the first page nora roberts just makes you feel as though you know the characters so well it is a wonderful 3 part story of 3 sisters of the heart it takes you through each of their lives and their evolution into the women they are today this first book is focused on margo , a maid 's daughter she has huge dreams and sets out to find them and make them come true read this book to see her set out , find and lose her self and then come full circle back to the place she started out
i really like the characters in this book 3 girls raised as sisters laura rich girl parents own several hotels around the world katie parents died and is a cousin of laura 's parents take her in after her parents traggic death then there is margo the daughter of the house keeper her father died in a boating accident lost at sea when she was 4 and they moved to america from ireland laura , katie , and margo were raised as sisters and were best friends and they each have their own struggles and dreams laura marries young in life to a man whom both of her friends and her brother josh dislike katie goes to harvard after she graduates a year early and margo 's mom is pressuring her to go to harvard with katie but instead runs off to hollywood and europe to become a model against her moms and josh 's wishes margo returns 10 years later life in shambles who wil help her pick up the pieces to her broken carreer and overdue bills this is a great book i read it in 24 hours
i enjoyed this book very much i am going to read the whole dream trilogy just so i can find out what happens to josh and margo i thought that daring to dream was an excellent book , but the ending was slightly unrealistic why would josh forgive her when she was kissing another man \? overall , the book was good , though
this is a great book if one is interested in learning more about the world of lbo 's and the dealings of wall street if you read den of thieves and liked that one you 'll definitely love this one
an enjoyable book which offers a good insight into the lbo business and the workings of wall street during the 1980s there are some serious amounts of money involved and some very amusing characters it almost reads like a comedy when detailing the exploits and excess of the chairman of rjr nabisco with his fleet of company jets and superstar cronies
nearly two decades after the leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco , wall street is back where it started the people have changed , but greed and scheming to get to the top is constant
the story was very interesting and i could n't put the book down
excellent this book is to private equity what monkey business is to investment banking and liars poker is to bond traders a must read for any one who deals with wall street
this has to be the most boring book i have ever read well , i have n't quite finished it yet as it 's taking forever to push my way through it and i'm sure that more boring books exist , i just have n't read them
i bought this for two reasons because i wanted to learn about lbos , and because i had heard that the journalism was good , and was hoping for something like 'the right stuff' the cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing , and 'all the suspense of a first rate thriller'
there are plenty of good summaries of this book here , so i 'll briefly make one point this book is a good read , but the business climate has changed dramatically since it was written , and many of the characters here are retired or have moved to very different investing styles so the book is worth reading , but i'm not convinced it is as timely as say lowenstein 's books on the internet bubble or hedge funds , or any of the many enron books out now
this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m a work , i decided to read it i thought the book was excellent , but maybe unnecessarily long the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not , but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job , this book is a must for everyone else that just likes good non fiction , this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era
it 's amazing the number of ways you can get ripped off if you learn one thing from this book , it 's that you 've got to watch your a

a must read ! captivating , informative and educational do n't allow yourself to become an unwitting victim impower yourself with frank 's knowledge
this book holds alot of great information on how to protect yourself , it can even make you paranoid , about who has all your info ! it is also a great story in itself a must read with the book catch me if you can
sidney homer delivers what he promised a lengthy and extremely detailed history of interest rates almost completely absent is any commentary on why interest rates have changed through history any observations of cause and effect are left up to the reader to discern but as a pure history text , the book is readable and thorough both in breadth and depth
financial assets grow in value with the passage of time for debt , we call this interest , and for equity , we call it yield homer 's book is the superbly recorded history of this phenomenon perhaps its greatest value is that when you hear or read a new theory , you can assess its validity by comparing the theory 's implications with the historical evidence
i really liked this one because of the characters and of course the background being about wine and the lifestyle of those who create it \) i definitely recommend this one
i could n't put the book down when i first bought it here it is months later and i 've read it again the story is great ! i do wish that nora roberts would have continued the story maybe into a trilogy i would like to know more about what happens to sophia and ty also pillar and david i highly recommend this book its definitely one of her best
this is one of roberts' best this has a great plot , wonderfully human characters and an excellent background and back story the book gives an excellent taste of california wine country as well as a thrilling plot tyler and sophia are a great pair to get to know as well as sophia 's mother and grandmother definitely a book to keep you turning each page to find out what happens next
being a guy , i was n't raised reading romance books after reading my first nora roberts book i was hooked nora has such a range in her books that there is something for everyone this is one of her best i started this book on the morning of a day off from work after putting it down once to eat , i had it done by mid afternoon the plot is intense , the characters are easy to get connected to this would make a great movie nora make this a trilogy please do n't miss this one
once again , nora has created a page turner while helping us to get to know the giambelli women , nora weaves a tale of intrigue , mystery , betrayal and deceit and just when you think you have it all figured out , she surprises us with a twist at the very end as usual , you will know the characters so well that you will hate for the story to end
this book is a lifetime movie if one was ever written
i thoroughly enjoyed the storyline \( falcon crest revisited \) of the villa the characters , plots and descriptions of the napa valley as well as a lesson in great wine making only add to the saga of the giambelli family and the corporate espionage that unfolds during the course of the novel i particularly enjoyed the relationship development of pilar and david cutter and while some readers felt that sophia 's character was a bit cold , i enjoyed watching her tough guy hard shell antics soften as she accepted the love of a man and the warmth and care that he brought forth with that love the climax and the revealing of the villain was a complete surprise to me i had narrowed it down to two people \( neither of which were the actual killer \) and never guessed the real bad guy until it was all played out
`the villa' was magnificent nora roberts 's novel the basis story is about a family of wine makers who find themselves fighting to save the family business after numerous murders , bad business , affairs and fire all with a mix of romance this book has some nice twists that you will enjoy if you are looking for fun romance with a story i would also suggest kate angell `crazy for you' and the ice house by minette walters
i have read most of crichton 's books i obviously got sucked into his books with jurassic park , congo , and sphere i have continued to read his books through prey and state of fear crichton 's writing has evolved from a lot of science woven into an action story to overwhelmingly science heavy with a good story underneath that
this book has one thing going for it right from the get go dinosaurs ! you know its going to be action packed right there
though saying my favorite book ever is n't saying much , this really does deserve to be a best seller first , if you are new to jurassic park , watch the movie first , it will make a lot more sense now , get into this
easily one of the best and most influential science fiction stories ever written
when i read that michael crichton made almost a billion dollars for jurassic park , i was a little surprised i saw the movie , it was ok , not to my tastes though then i read the book then i knew why
wow , what a book ! in my opinion , considerably better than the movie particularly the first 80 pages are very , very strong crichton 's technique of repeatedly shifting points of view from the doctor in the costa rican jungle , to the vacationing family , to one biologist , to another , and eventually to our heros , sattler and grant , and then malcolm etc is tremendously effective normally this would be confusing but somehow he pulls it off we can all smell what 's coming dinosaurs ! and yet we want to see it ! we need to see it !
i finally got around to reading the book jurassic park by michael crichton paleontologists dr alan grant and dr ellie sattler , chaos mathematician dr ian malcolm and lawyer donald gennaro are invited by hammond to his resort island off costa rica to their astonishment , they discover that hammond and his ingen corporation using fossil dna , supercomputers and gene sequencers have been able to clone dinosaurs at the jurassic park the group is also joined by hammond 's grandchildren tim and lex murphy they all set out on a park ride to check out the dinosaurs when all hell breaks loose
